<p>In the middle of the Atlantic, a gigantic tower stretches to the heavens. Within the Tower are floors as large as countries, self-contained worlds that defy all imagination. When was it built? Was it always there from the start? What lies at the top?</p>

<p>These mysteries of the Tower have persisted for centuries ever since its discovery, and no real answers have been forthcoming. Scholars puzzled over it, politicians fought over it, and priests worshiped it, all in their own way.</p>
