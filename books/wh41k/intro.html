<br />
The Emperor is dead. The Golden Throne is silent. The Astronomican has darkened. The Cadian Gate has been overrun by the Despoiler, and the entire sector has been lost. The Imperium has fallen.<br />
<br />
Warp travel has been disrupted, and the Eldar have fled to their craftworlds, fearful that without the God-Emperor&#039;s shield the Devourer will soon find them. The galaxy is in uproar. Sector-to-Sector communication no longer works; The Administratum has been fragmented. The Adeptus Astra Telepathica have managed to sustain local network communication-and-guidance relays, but they are erratic and most ships that venture into the Warp are lost to it. The Imperial Guard no longer serves a purpose; they do not know what they are guarding. <br />
<br />
The Imperium is at its knees, crippled, headless. The High Lords of Terra scurry around like ants without a queen. Many of the Astartes Chapters don&#039;t even know what is happening; their battlebarges too few, too far. The Inquisition itself has been dealt a deathly blow; without its information network, heresy runs rampant. The Tyrant Star has been sighted far from its sector of origin. The Techpriests in Mars have succumbed to holy fervor and now openly worship the Omnissiah as a separate entity from the Emperor, and say it lays in the bowels of their planet. <br />
<br />
In the gloom of space, there is no hope. No shelter. There is only war.  But it is a war without form, a war amongst shadows. No-one knows where the first blow will hit, from whose hand it will come. The scattered worlds of the Imperium stand in dread as they await their destiny, the corrupting influences of Chaos already manifested en masse. <br />
<br />
Yet Chaos itself is weakened; something other than the Ruinous Powers roams the Immaterium, and the Traitor Legions have been battling a formless terror ever since the Emperor&#039;s demise. Not even the Gods themselves know what else lies in the coldest, deepest darkness of the dead stars that lie half in this world and half in the next.<br />
<br />
In the grim darkness of the 42nd millenium, there is only horror.<br />
