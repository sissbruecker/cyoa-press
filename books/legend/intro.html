    The land is in turmoil. Petty bureaucrats hold sway over the cities, while banditry is rife outside of it. The pugilistic sects of the country have become the only institutions that establish a semblance of order where the reach of the Imperial Court is weak. The golden age of chivalry - the code of the pugilists - is dawning, but it may just as soon end. There has been conflict between the sects, as old rivalries and hatreds boil to the forefront now that they have gained in influence and desire even more.<br />

    What can one person accomplish in this cauldron of chaos?<br />
    <br />
    Overthrow and replace the Son of Heaven, who has lost his mandate to rule?<br />
    <br />
    Unite the bickering pugilistic sects under one banner, to usher in a new world?<br />
    <br />
    Or to live out life quietly on the sidelines, away from the troubles of the era?<br />
    <br />
    It is from such stories that legends arise...<br />
