    <p>
    The land is in turmoil. Petty bureaucrats hold sway over the cities, while banditry is rife outside of it. The pugilistic sects of the country have become the only institutions that establish a semblance of order where the reach of the Imperial Court is weak. The golden age of chivalry - the code of the pugilists - is dawning, but it may just as soon end. There has been conflict between the sects, as old rivalries and hatreds boil to the forefront now that they have gained in influence and desire even more.<br />
    <br />
    What can one person accomplish in this cauldron of chaos?<br />
    <br />
    Overthrow and replace the Son of Heaven, who has lost his mandate to rule?<br />
    <br />
    Unite the bickering pugilistic sects under one banner, to usher in a new world?<br />
    <br />
    Or to live out life quietly on the sidelines, away from the troubles of the era?<br />
    <br />
    It is from such stories that legends arise...<br />

            <h3>一 · A Meeting with the Ashina</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">A Meeting with the Ashina</span></b><br>
<br>
The dry grass crunches under your feet as you pull the woolen cloak tighter around your body. Out here on the steppes, the winds are merciless. A group of five soldiers ride past you, jeering at each other as they race onwards, towards your common destination. Your legs are aching from the long walk, but the journey is almost over.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I <i>did</i> offer to let you ride in the carriage, Jing,&#x201D; says the young Crown Prince lazily as he brings his steed to a slow trot besides you. You stare at him, and then glance over at said carriage, a rather ornate affair that bears both the flags of the great Tang dynasty and that of the Duke of Xiliang. The duke himself is ensconced comfortably inside the carriage; you can see his bearded, imperious profile. He notices you and gives you a foul glare in return. &#x201C;He&#x2019;d as soon kill me then let me anywhere near his carriage, after what I did to his horses,&#x201D; you laugh. The prince chuckles. Over the period of two weeks, one horse had fallen awkwardly over a well-hidden stone, another had been spooked by a rat and fled into the wilderness, and the last had simply laid down and died. After that, the Duke insisted that he had no more spare horses for you to use. &#x201C;Perhaps you should be steering your horse away from me, Shun.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Crown Prince Li Shun, future Emperor of the Tang, gives you a rude, juvenile gesture, smiling elegantly as he does so. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re just bad with horses, nothing more. Cats like you well enough. Besides, you spent all summer riding with me without even hurting a single horse.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was the other way around back then,&#x201D; you mutter. You had been thrown from the saddle so many times that sometimes you are still surprised that you survived. &#x201C;Anyway, are <i>you </i>ready for the meeting?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun sighs as he shifts uncomfortably in his seat. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a pain in my arse, that&#x2019;s what it is. Still, we have no choice. Do you know of the Ashina?&#x201D; You nod &#x2013; they are one of the most influential nomadic tribes in the northwest. &#x201C;The Ashina tribe have a strong voice amongst the Tujue people,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;so if we manage to nurture a proper alliance, we can secure the border more easily in the years to come.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. The Ashina are regarded as a sacred tribe. The Great Khagan of the Tujue has been stockpiling resources in the past few months &#x2013; we were sent out here because the Emperor hopes that my presence will be enough to flatter them. The Duke of Xiliang will be in charge of the negotiations, so we are just along for display.&#x201D; He peers closely at you, leaning down from his horse.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Speaking of that, my friend, you will need to clean up before we can display you anywhere.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You snort. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t bother. I don&#x2019;t want to steal the eyes of all the girls away from your royal face.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You find yourself nursing your aching legs in the main yurt later that night, having cleaned up and changed into a fresh set of robes. The yurt can be described in one word: grandiose. The ground was covered with a lush carpet and strips of silken cloth were draped over the poles. Beautiful tapestries lined the walls of the yurt. The leader of the Ashina, Bulun Khan, sat cross-legged at a table painted in gold, presiding over the festivities &#x2013; he is a well-built, powerful man who has found that middle age is treating him well. A beautiful young girl who looks to be about the same age with the prince and you &#x2013; she can&#x2019;t be more than thirteen or fourteen years old &#x2013; knelt demurely by his side. Judging from her elaborately embroidered dress and the decorative beads, she is probably the khan&#x2019;s daughter. A pretty servant girl stands by her side, a wide yawn showing that she&apos;s not pretending to hide her boredom.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Have you tried the fermented mare&#x2019;s milk? It&#x2019;s rather wonderful,&#x201D; says Shun as he holds up a dirty-looking gourd. You obligingly hold out your dish as he fills it up, the both of you looking at the duke and the Ashina khan conversing raucously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It seems like it is going well, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; you say quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, not at all. Observe the khan closely,&#x201D; whispers Shun.  You do so, and after a while, understand what he means. Although the khan seemed friendly enough, from his body language and the tone of his accented Han, you know that this is the type of friendliness you offer a guest you dislike, but are too polite to turn down.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I doubt he is truly listening to Xiliang,&#x201D; you mutter. &#x201C;It looks like the Ashina don&#x2019;t care about you at all, Your Highness. Do you feel hurt?&#x201D; Shun nods in agreement at first, and then punches your shoulder for the latter remark.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;-so, perhaps we could even take your esteemed daughter in as an honoured concubine,&#x201D; states Xiliang casually. Bulun leans back, his features carefully impassive. &#x201C;A concubine to who?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The duke laughs. &#x201C;Not His Majesty, of course, but his son. The Crown Prince is young but mature,&#x201D; &#x2013; you hold back a laugh at that, with tremendous effort &#x2013; &#x201C;and is a remarkable, good-looking boy who will lead the Tang to greater glory. In the future, even his concubines will enjoy power and status beyond that of the empresses of old.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Before Bulun can respond, a dagger sprouts on the khan&#x2019;s golden table with a loud thud. &#x201C;I will not sit here and listen to talk about trading me away like a common goat,&#x201D; the Ashina princess says calmly as she rises to her feet. &#x201C;Yunzi, sit down,&#x201D; warns the khan half-heartedly, but the girl continues. &#x201C;Dear father, these Han talk too easily of marriage. I would like to show them what a woman of the Ashina is capable of. A worthy man should be able to best me in combat.&#x201D; The Duke of Xiliang looks at the Crown Prince &#x2013; Xiliang doesn&#x2019;t seem too worried, though his brow is slightly furrowed in concern, feigned or otherwise.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh boy, are you in for it, brother,&#x201D; you whisper mockingly to Shun. The Crown Prince is rather good at the rudimentary martial arts that the both of you have been taught for self defense, though not as good as you are. You don&#x2019;t doubt that he can beat the slender waif in a fight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If I were to pick,&#x201D; proclaims Yunzi, &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t even challenge the prince. He would not be a match for me. You there. The arrogant servant whispering in his master&#x2019;s ear.&#x201D; Her angry gaze falls upon you &#x2013; her eyes are as blue as the clear steppe sky. &#x201C;I challenge you to show what you are capable of.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; The corners of your lips twitch upwards. &#x201C;You want to fight <i>me</i>?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing!&#x201D; Xiliang shouts at you. &#x201C;Do not act rashly!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He knows, however, that he does not have the authority to order you around. The Duke of Xiliang may be the cousin of the Chancellor, and command a hundred thousand men, and you might just be a fourteen year old cocky kid who happens to be the Crown Prince&#x2019;s confidante, but you are not his servant. You glance sideways at Shun&#x2019;s hand. Two fingers are extended, circling twice in a clockwise manner. That&#x2019;s the gesture for &#x2018;Do as you please&#x2019;, which also means, in your experience gained from the decade you have spent as his companion, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m going to sit back and enjoy the show&#x2019;.<br>
<br>
Your leash is off.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You accept the challenge. Both Shun and you suspect that negotiations are not going to go well &#x2013; Bulun Khan will just send the Duke off without committing to anything. When the situation is stagnant, act to change the flow in your favour. You aren&#x2019;t standing up <i>just </i>because you can&#x2019;t back down from a challenge. Obviously.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You keep quiet, back down, and yield the floor to Xiliang and Bulun so that they can continue their negotiations. You don&#x2019;t want to cross the Duke of Xiliang if you can help it; he already disilkes you enough, and even if he cannot order you around, he can certainly pull some strings to make your life harder.

            <h3>二 · Horseplay</h3>
            </a>

<br>
Here is the update. The character sheet will be updated with the reputation tracker.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Horseplay</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I accept,&#x201D; you reply confidently. There is a triumphant smirk on the girl&#x2019;s face as she turns to face Bulun Khan. &#x201C;You heard him, father.&#x201D; The khan&#x2019;s laughter bellows throughout the yurt as he slaps his thigh. &#x201C;Excellent! I can&#x2019;t say you don&#x2019;t have balls, kid! Even our people would ask for the nature of the challenge before accepting it, but you agreed without hesitation! Very well, I shall arrange for the match. You will meet my dear daughter in the field tomorrow morning&#x2026; I am looking forward to it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun gives you a look of sympathy, trying not to smile. The Duke of Xiliang, on the other hand, glares at you venomously. He gets up and apologizes to the khan, excusing himself from the banquet. As he passes by your seat, he bends down and hisses, &#x201C;For your own sake, do not mess this up, boy. But do not think for one second that I will overlook the rudeness you have displayed today.&#x201D; Giving a deep bow to the Crown Prince, he stomps out of the yurt angrily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are in deep trouble, Jing,&#x201D; muses your good friend, the one who had tacitly egged you on.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll survive,&#x201D; you say dismissively, though deep down you think that it would be better if you found a way to assuage the duke&#x2019;s displeasure. Even now, he would be composing a strongly worded letter to his dear cousin the Chancellor in his head.<br>
<br>
Fortunately - or unfortunately - you had other, more immediate problems to think about for now, and you wouldn&#x2019;t have to deal with the troublesome matters of the court until the retinue returns to Tianshui.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The morning air is invigorating and you find yourself in good condition. The aches from your long walk have almost cleared up from a good night&#x2019;s sleep, though some niggling pain still remains in your lower calves. As you head to the location of the match, you find that it is already surrounded by what seems to be every single inhabitant of the camp, right down to the elderly and the children. The mood is festive; you have this sudden feeling that everyone is here to watch the upstart Han get beaten by their princess. Making your way through the laughing crowd, you find yourself in the middle of a circle, with the onlookers acting as a living fence.<br>
<br>
In the middle of the field two bare-backed horses stand placidly side-by-side, one black, one white. Princess Yunzi is already there, having swapped her elaborate dress of yesternight for a more practical and plain commoner&#x2019;s garment. Her hair is tied up into a tight bun, and there is a short whip rolled up and hanging from her waist-sash. As she catches sight of you, she turns away without a word.<br>
<br>
You spot the Duke of Xiliang and the Crown Prince standing next to Bulun, at the front of the onlookers. Shun waves at you, shouting out &#x201C;Good luck!&#x201D;. You wish that were so. The khan climbs up onto a wooden box set at one end of the arena and begins detailing, in a singsong voice, the events that had led to this challenge, in the dialect of his people. You don&#x2019;t understand enough Tujue to make out what he is saying except for frequent mentions of both your name and his daughter&#x2019;s, but by the frequent cheers of the crowd, you assume they are hearing something that they like. At the end of his speech, he switches back to Han, for your benefit.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The rules of the trial are simple. You are to stand atop the horses and attempt to knock each other off. The first person to touch the ground with any part of their body loses. Anyone who strikes a horse will be disqualified. You may use any weapon you wish except for blades - no blood should spill on the sacred trial grounds. The trial will begin when both parties signal that they are ready.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look around the arena, and then at the girl. While she has a whip, there doesn&#x2019;t seem to be anything you can use unless you start begging for weapons from the audience. You do have a sword in your tent, but the khan has just disallowed the use of blades. Yunzi catches you looking at her whip and smiles nastily. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I won&#x2019;t need to use it to beat you. Feel free to ask for something to help you out. Perhaps someone will throw you their dog&#x2019;s stick.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You remark casually, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not worried about that little whip, I&#x2019;ve eaten worse for punishment.&#x201D; That is the truth - in fact, you are more worried about the horse, given your past history with equines. Then again, standing atop a horse is difficult, even for a nomad. You are confident that your agility can match hers; this match may end up being more equal than she thinks. Yunzi ignores you, gently patting the white horse. Then, she vaults atop the animal with a single leap, landing lightly on its back. Looking down at you from her perch, the girl gives you a smirk that grates on your nerves. &#x201C;I am ready,&#x201D; she declares.<br>
<br>
You approach the black horse and place your hand on it. The horse&#x2019;s big, watery eye blinks at you suspiciously. A threatening snort flares from his nostrils. With some trepidation, you grab the horse&#x2019;s mane and haul yourself onto its back. It hooves the ground in protest, but it does not start bucking in an attempt to throw you off. You take that to be a good sign. Drawing your legs up and placing your feet on the horse&#x2019;s back, you slowly stand up, wobbling to keep your balance as the horse shifts restlessly. You find yourself face to face with Yunzi, who is standing easily with a graceful poise. Her horse seems as still as a statue, with only the swishing of its tail to show that it is indeed a living animal. How on earth is she doing that?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll beat you within ten moves,&#x201D; she says, raising one hand in front of her in a Tujue stance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll see. I&#x2019;m ready,&#x201D; you call out, as you concentrate on your footing and balance.<br>
<br>
Bulun Khan shouts, giving us the signal to begin. The crowd roars in approval, singing their princess&#x2019;s name. There will be no support for you here.<br>
<br>
Yunzi strikes without hesitation - she takes the first move and drives her fist towards your face. She is fast&#x2026; perhaps faster than you are. You instinctively flinch, raising your arm to redirect her punch, but it is just a feint. Her left leg lashes out a split-second afterwards. With a grunt, you raise your knee just in time to avoid getting your shin kicked. As you are forced to shift your weight onto one foot, your horse begins to protest by shaking its flanks.<br>
<br>
Your balance is thrown off, just for a while, and Yunzi pounces on the opportunity eagerly.<br>
<br>
She throws both palms outwards in a shove, attempting to simply push you off the horse. Gritting your teeth, you fling your entire body forwards, throwing yourself into her attack. As her palms slam into your shoulders, you groan - she can hit rather hard for such a slender girl. However, your judgement is accurate, as her attack stops you from falling over. As she blinks in surprise, you bring your arms upwards, pushing her hands away. You follow up with a quick jab to her abdomen. A confident glint in her eyes, Yunzi opts to evade it instead of blocking. Her feet dance deftly across the horse&#x2019;s back as your punch goes wide.<br>
<br>
She attempts to drive her knee into your left arm while it is still extended, but you twist your body to the left, retracting it in time. using your motion to launch a sweeping attack with your right arm. Caught by your move, she is cornered and unable to dodge. She blocks desperately - your sweep hits home, and the Ashina princess staggers slightly under the force of your blow, letting out a sharp gasp. Her eyes water - it probably hurts a lot. In the heat of battle, you had forgotten to hold back.<br>
<br>
Yunzi quickly regains her composure and glares at you. Her visage blurs. Your instincts warn you to move back, and you do so just in time - her feet skim the tip of your nose as the girl does a backflip. She lands on the horse&#x2019;s back just as easily as she would on solid ground. That damned white horse is still standing calmly despite the action that had just taken place above it. Your horse, on the other hand, is getting more and more jumpy by the second. &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re thinking of holding back, don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m going to kill you.&#x201D; She gives you a warning and a threat at the same time. Breathing in deeply, Yunzi adopts an unfamiliar stance and immediately begins a furious flurry of moves.<br>
<br>
She unleashes a continuous stream of attacks with both fist and foot, attempting to find a way past your guard. It takes all you have to defend yourself - her speed is such that you cannot find the space to attack. Suddenly, she breaks her rhythm and draws back. Your arm still raised halfway to a block, Yunzi takes advantage of the lull in combat to close the distance and places one foot on your horse. The girl swings her right fist up in an uppercut, yelling as she does so.<br>
<br>
You curse your carelessness and attempt to grab her fist, but your fingers close around empty air as she turns at the last minute and uses your horse as a stepping stone, smoothly pivoting into an overhead kick aimed at the back of your neck. You are forced to move your feet again, shifting your foothold so that her kick misses. This causes your horse to buck once in response, as you step on some spot you probably shouldn&#x2019;t have.<br>
<br>
You drop your center of gravity, crouching down low to restore your balance as you watch Yunzi gracefully step back to her own horse, which is still standing there patiently as if it is the most natural thing in the world. She clucks her tongue with a look of distaste on her face, as if she can&#x2019;t believe you managed to survive her assault. &#x201C;Lucky idiot,&#x201D; grumbles the princess. &#x201C;Hey,&#x201D; you call out to her, &#x201C;did you feed your horse something to keep it docile?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s rude of you to say so,&#x201D; she snorts. &#x201C;You are just lousy at understanding a horse&#x2019;s spirit. As expected of a Han.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, whatever. We are just kids having a clumsy slapfight on top of the horses anyway,&#x201D; you laugh, your fingers surreptitiously fiddling with the laces of your left shoe. The princess flushes and resumes the attack, displeased that you don&#x2019;t seem to be taking this as seriously as she is. &#x201C;If you have time to talk, stand up and lose properly!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The two of you exchange three more moves - with the last exchange narrowly sweeping your feet off the horse - before she attempts another of her misdirecting techniques. Just what you have been waiting for. You take the chance and swing your foot out, just as she thinks you have fallen for her feint. Surprised, she jerks backwards, but she has not accounted for your dirty shoe flying off and hitting her right in the face. There is a loud smack. The roaring crowd falls into silence almost immediately. Then, they burst into riotous laughter. Regaining your posture quickly, you snake your right arm around her left before the stunned girl can react and lock it into position, pulling her close to you by her shoulder. The crowd is audibly impressed.<br>
<br>
You get a whiff of sweat mixed with her fragrance as Yunzi looks at you in anger and humiliation - you are decidedly stronger and she won&#x2019;t be able to break your hold easily. The advantage is now yours. &#x201C;You know, I believe that it has been more than ten moves,&#x201D; you say quietly, triumphantly. &#x201C;Shut up and unhand me,&#x201D; snarls the princess. Her fair face has turned rather red. When you refuse with a taunting shake of your head, she goes limp and lets herself fall backwards without warning. Her weight pulls at you. You are forced to let go before you are brought down together with her, though you manage to find the presence of mind to give Yunzi a little shove to help her along the way.<br>
<br>
Then, a sudden gust of strong wind throws you off balance; not that you had ever been really balanced on the horse anyway. As you stumble, you see the girl turning her fall into a nimble roll under her horse&#x2019;s belly. She emerges on the near flank of the horse, her whip already in her left hand. Yunzi cracks her whip, the lash coming close to your steed&#x2019;s eye but not hitting it. The black horse gets spooked and rears up with a loud whinny, putting you in a very precarious position. Despite all that, you can&#x2019;t help but grudgingly admire her pig-headed nature - she is willing to skirt the rules of the match just to beat you.<br>
<br>
If you do nothing, you will fall in the next second. Already she is standing back on top of her horse, her arm raised for a second crack of her whip.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> You have already done enough. You allow yourself to fall, even if you could regain your balance. Best to lose honourably - a man should know when he is beaten. Besides, you have just realized - a bit too late - that if you really do win, you might actually be forced to marry this shrew.<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> You attempt to regain your balance, but attempt to surrender the moment you do, in order to save some face. You are not sure how the Ashina might interpret this, but losing outright by touching the ground is rather embarrassing, after all the confidence you displayed going into the match.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You will not give up; if she hates to lose, so do you. You jump onto her horse. You will continue the fight there - there is nothing in the rules saying that you can&#x2019;t share the horse, and she did step on yours during the fight. Let&#x2019;s see that stupid white horse take two people fighting on top of it.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You regain your balance and focus intently on her whip. When she next lashes out, you will attempt to grab the whip and then pull her off her horse. You should be strong enough to do that. If she lets go to avoid falling, you will have the whip, and then the tables will be turned!

<br>
You land on the other horse&#x2019;s back successfully if clumsily, having abandoned your rearing steed. It was an easy hop that took Yunzi by surprise, bringing the two of you face to face. She was more shocked than angered. The moment you arrive, however, she drives her foot towards you, hoping to knock you off before you have recovered from your landing. You barely manage to avoid it, twisting to the side. Your hasty dodge puts you in a poor position, your right heel touching thin air. Yunzi steps towards you aggressively, pressing her advantage with speed - she could knock you off with another blow. You brace yourself.<br>
<br>
Then, her horse begins to move. Neighing loudly, it breaks into a trot. You can hear the crowd shouting; from the corner of your eyes, you see men beginning to run towards the horse. Even after having crouched down to steady yourself, you feel like you may be thrown off at any second. The princess, however, is caught by surprise, letting out a little yelp as she loses her balance and latches on to you for just a brief while, falling into your arms.<br>
<br>
You see her eyes widen as she registers her mistake. Too late. You grab her left arm with both hands and pull, using the motion to balance yourself in the process - she attempts to resist, but cannot fight your strength. The princess falls. You&#x2019;ve won.<br>
<br>
Yunzi&#x2019;s leg kicks out, unexpectedly sweeping you off your feet. You realize that her hand has been gripping the collar of your robes tightly, and you are pulled down along with her.<br>
<br>
<i>She should still hit the ground first</i>, you expect. Her desperate attempt won&#x2019;t rob you of your win.<br>
<br>
Her thin fingers dig into your collar-bone as she twists.<br>
<br>
She swings herself above you in mid-air, using her grip on you as leverage.<br>
<br>
<i>You have got to be kidding me</i>, you think, as you slam into the ground. Her knees follow, sinking into your abdomen and compounding the pain. The reversal has happened so fast that you barely had time to register it, but at the very last second, the princess has somehow snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.<br>
<br>
Yunzi gets off you unsteadily, her legs trembling. Panting from the exertions of the fight, she gives you a weak, contemptuous kick in the ribs before staggering towards the horse with a concerned look on her face. You&#x2019;re still winded from that last blow and can&#x2019;t offer her any reply. Wheezing on the ground, you can see that the horse is bucking and whinnying, a rather alarming amount of foam coming from its mouth.<br>
<br>
Hopefully it&#x2019;ll be okay.<br>
<br>
A shadow falls over you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good job, Jing,&#x201D; says Shun cheerfully as he bends over your fallen body. He reaches out a hand. You clasp it, allowing him to help you to your feet. You see that the princess and several other tribespeople are dragging the struggling white horse away. When she turns to glare daggers at you, her eyes are wet, upset at the ailment that has stricken the horse. You get the feeling that she is blaming it on you.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the Ashina are cheering loudly, some of them having started blowing on horns and flutes in an impromptu performance. Others are dancing to the music. It almost looks like a celebration. Several burly men and rough-looking women come up to you and pat you on the back, speaking excitedly and unintelligibly in their language. You cannot do anything but give them a confused smile, still groggy from hitting the ground. As they lead you away from the waving, grinning Crown Prince, a little girl with a cheeky smile runs up on her stubby legs and puts a garland over your neck. You wonder what it&#x2019;s for.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve spent the last half hour expressing your irritation with the princess, Jing,&#x201D; groans Shun, pinching your gloomy face. &#x201C;I know you hate losing in a match, but she did beat you fair and square.&#x201D; The both of you are resting in a tent, waiting for news from the Duke of Xiliang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll admit that,&#x201D; you say grudgingly, &#x201C;though you think she could be a bit more gracious about it, being a princess and all. Anyway, if we were fighting on solid ground, I would have won.&#x201D; You rub your aching stomach, sore at your loss. &#x201C;So, what did the duke say?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The prince&#x2019;s face turns serious. &#x201C;Stay out of his way for a while. Your horse-jumping stunt made him really angry. It was too reckless.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You think it was too reckless?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, it was fun to watch, but I wouldn&#x2019;t have tried it. For multiple reasons. I&#x2019;m sure it will work out fine in the end, however.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are about to ask him what reasons, when Bulun Khan comes sweeping into the tent. You remember your manners and drop to one knee, though Shun, being Shun, merely greets the khan with a smile and a lazy wave. A tall Ashina with a powerful build follows Bulun into the tent, his face seemingly carved from stone. His hair hangs in multiple braids.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to be so formal,&#x201D; laughs the khan as he drops to the ground and sits down without a care. He beckons at you to do the same. You bow and proceed to sit cross-legged, facing him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Have you come to terms with Xiliang?&#x201D; asks Shun directly. The khan places both hands on his thighs, leans forward, and replies, &#x201C;Yes, Prince Shun. The Ashina will be a voice of moderation in the upcoming kurultai. We will tell them that the Tang are full of young tigers,&#x201D; -he gestures at both you and the prince when he says that, &#x201C;-and will not be easy prey. However, the current Khagan is a man who takes advantage where he sees it. Despite what we may say, he knows that your borders are weak, and porous to his raids. Our words will only buy you time. The Pugu and Bayegu tribes are pressing for full invasion, and their influence grows by the day.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun nods, bowing his head respectfully. &#x201C;That will be sufficient, Bulun Khan. The Tang thanks you for your understanding. It is better for us to grow stronger together. There is enough in the world for both the Tujue and the Tang.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed. I have always been convinced of the importance of cooperation, but we needed to show the representatives of the other tribes what we already knew. They have witnessed a great performance from the Han today and will return impressed,&#x201D; says the khan. &#x201C;I apologize for not being straightforward, but it was necessary to see what you would do. More importantly, what should we do with the young lad that just declared his love so publicly?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What?&#x201D; You sputter.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right, I guess you didn&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; explains Shun calmly, though there is an amused glint in his eyes. &#x201C;For a man to give up his own steed and cross over to a woman&#x2019;s horse is a confident declaration of undying love amongst the Ashina.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t&#x2026; well, forget about that,&#x201D; you groan. You understand that rituals are rituals, and symbolism overrides intent. At least you will be returning to the capital soon, where you can forget about all that has happened here. Who cares if you mistakenly professed love to that girl?  Something else concerned you more. &#x201C;Was our match just a show, then, wise khan?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, let me guess,&#x201D; says the khan with a grin. &#x201C;You dislike the idea of having competed falsely, in a rigged match? Even if you lost, you wanted to lose in a meaningful competition?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not worry about that, kid,&#x201D; says Bulun. &#x201C;My wayward daughter reacted entirely out of her own impetuousness. I had other plans for this visit, but she acted rashly and jumped to conclusions about her marriage prospects, devising a ploy to challenge you and show how much better she is. It was unexpected to me too, but I decided to work with that instead.&#x201D; The khan&#x2019;s sly smile tells you that he is rather more cunning than you gave him credit for&#x2026; or perhaps that is just the slyness of adults.<br>
<br>
He continues cheerfully, &#x201C;Even though you lost today, the Ashina will be very happy to see you challenge Yunzi again. Already my people say that they haven&#x2019;t seen such a show since my own trial against my dearly departed wife. They think it is only a matter of time before you marry Yunzi, and have already started celebrating in earnest at the prospect of adding a promising young man to the tribe. Then again, they need very little reason to bring out the music and alcohol, so do not be too alarmed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Challenge her again? I am sorry, noble khan, but we will definitely kill each other if we have a second match,&#x201D; you mutter bitterly but politely.<br>
<br>
That just seems to feed the khan&#x2019;s amusement, and he roars in laughter. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s exactly what she said! You two really are alike, kid. Xu Jing, was it? Well, Xu Jing, there is no hurry. You may return to challenge her anytime before the age of maturity, before both of you turn twenty. I highly doubt there is any other man that would be able to take her.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I must decline, great khan. With all due respect, I do not get along with your daughter in the slightest. It would be an unhappy marriage. If I had won, I would have to honour my word, but it seems that I have lost. I have accepted my defeat.&#x201D; Of course, you haven&#x2019;t really gotten over it, but you feel the need to make your intentions clear to the khan, and swallowing your loss appears to be the quickest way to do so.<br>
<br>
The khan&#x2019;s eyes only twinkles in a manner that suggests he understands something that you don&#x2019;t. His good humour does not seem to fade at your rejection. &#x201C;If you say so, Xu Jing. That is fine, young people have their own minds and will do as they desire. Now, in recognition of your bravery and entertaining display, I would like to present you with a gift that honours your skill.&#x201D; He beckons the tall man behind him to come forward.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My name is Huluzi,&#x201D; bows the man. &#x201C;Brother to Bulun.&#x201D; His voice is coarse and guttural.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Huluzi is the strongest warrior in the tribe,&#x201D; boasts the khan. &#x201C;Xu Jing, he will impart to you a technique of the Ashina.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun&#x2019;s eyes brighten up at the sound of that. &#x201C;Marvellous. Jing, do it,&#x201D; he dictates, pointing a finger at me. It looks like you have no choice but to accept.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You find yourself back in the open field with Huluzi. He stretches himself and gives your body a look over. &#x201C;You have a natural gift for martial arts, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Huluzi. &#x201C;The clan of the wolf has many techniques, but here are the three that I think will suit your level of skill and physical capability the most. I will instruct you in one technique, as per the khan&#x2019;s request.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Langya Fist. (&#x72FC;&#x7259;&#x62F3; Wolf&#x2019;s Fang Fist). A wolf pack harries and coordinates their movements to bring down their prey. This unarmed technique focuses on continuous, rapid moves to wear down an opponent&#x2019;s guard.<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> Yinglang Step. (&#x5F71;&#x72FC;&#x6B65; Shadow Wolf Step). A wolf is silent and stealthy in its hunt. This <i>qinggong</i> technique teaches the user to move swiftly, gently and quietly in the wilderness to avoid attracting attention.<br>
<br>
<b>C.</b> Tujue Shuzan Bow (&#x7A81;&#x53A5;&#x901F;&#x5BC1;&#x5F13; Tujue Swift Bow) A Tujue nomad is known for his mastery of the bow. This flexible bow technique allows its user to fire an arrow quickly while on the move.

            <h3>四 · Shadow Wolf</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Shadow Wolf</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;A wise choice. The deadliest fist is the one that is unseen.&#x201D; Huluzi reaches into his garment and pulls out a roll of goatskin. He holds it out, offering it to you. &#x201C;The moves of the Yinglang Step are recorded within. To understand them, you must first master the first step.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are slightly nervous, but take the parchment without hesitation and unroll it. It is full of badly drawn stick-men in various poses. You look up at Huluzi quizzically. He shrugs. &#x201C;The scroll-maker was not good at art, nor was he literate.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod slowly. From your limited understanding, many martial arts manuals were usually well-illustrated and written poetically - you needed to comprehend the meaning of the couplets to fully unlock the potential in the moves of the technique. Of course, there were as many different ways to impart martial arts as there were stars in the sky, and today you have taken that lesson to heart.<br>
<br>
Huluzi breathes in deeply, his posture changing in subtle ways. His breathing slows gradually until it is almost imperceptible to you. Then, he speaks, &#x201C;The first step is to learn how to put your foot down without making a sound. However, I can see that you are not familiar with the principles of qinggong. We will have to start from scratch.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It takes you three hours to learn how to carry your body with the ease required, and then to begin learning the first move of the technique - how to step silently. That takes only two hours to accomplish, impressing Huluzi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have a talent for imitating physical movement,&#x201D; he says, as you massage your aching muscles. The posture required to pull off the move still feels unnatural to you, though Huluzi assures you that will change with practice. &#x201C;After this, you just need to remember the mindset you achieved while carrying out the posture. You will find that the secrets of the scroll will unlock themselves gradually as you develop your understanding of the wolf&#x2019;s spirit.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You bow to him, thanking him for his tutelage. The sun is beginning to set - your last dinner here will be held soon. Tomorrow you return to the Central Plains. &#x201C;By the way,&#x201D; you can&#x2019;t help but ask before the both of you part ways, &#x201C;your Han is almost pitch perfect. Have you spent time in our cities?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Huluzi shakes his head. &#x201C;My departed mother was a half-Han concubine of Bulun&#x2019;s father; my grandmother was a minor Tang princess. They taught me the language,&#x201D; Your jaw falls open in surprise, but his own expression just grows grimmer. &#x201C;Since I have mentioned this, let me warn you to be careful, Xu Jing. The Imperial Court plays deadly games that wrap up innocents without a care, no matter how far they run. You should stay away from their politics.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Ashina warrior walks away, leaving you to your thoughts.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When you reach the large yurt, you find a scowling duke and a grinning prince, and that the only open space left at the tables is next to a sulking princess. Your feet falter for just a moment. Am I a man or a mouse? You berate yourself for the sudden reluctance that halts your steps. There is no need to be afraid of this stupid, pig-headed girl. Striding into the yurt with a big grin on your face as the tribesmen cheer your arrival with upraised gourds and dishes, you greet them enthusiastically and take your place on the ground.<br>
<br>
Your grin doesn&#x2019;t last long. Sitting besides such a sullen girl, your affected cheer is drained away in seconds.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you have to be unhappy about? You won,&#x201D; you grumble in a low voice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was happy until you sat down besides me,&#x201D; Yunzi seethes quietly. &#x201C;Leave me alone. Go run about the plains and howl at the moon.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going without dinner just because some spoiled girl wants to stretch her legs under the table.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s okay. I&#x2019;ll have your food thrown to you outside the tent.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What am I, a dog?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you your prince&#x2019;s dog? Go and bark at him, wag your tail, whatever it is you subservient Han do.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You take a deep breath and calm your tone, if not your temper. &#x201C;Aah, you are right. I am my prince&#x2019;s dog. I&#x2019;ll hunt for him and lick his feet and frolic with his gentle maids. That is still better than being with a flat-chested shrew like you. It&#x2019;s no wonder no one wants to marry-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Before you finish your sentence, her left fist lashes out. It almost hits you, but you are fast enough to catch it and return a punch of your own. Yunzi pushes herself backwards and narrowly evades your attack. Finding herself unable to free her left hand from your grasp, she extends the fingers on her right hand and goes for your eyes. You trap her fingers between your own and clasp her hand tightly, leaving the both of you without any free arms to fight with.<br>
<br>
Bulun Khan&#x2019;s shout interrupts your slapfight with Yunzi. The entire yurt falls into silence. With a sudden realization of where the two of you are, you freeze. The Duke of Xiliang is aghast, while Shun looks absolutely tickled. Huluzi, on the other hand, nods approvingly. You get the feeling he is admiring your moves rather than any display of chivalry - or lack of it - on your part.<br>
<br>
The khan slams his palm down on the table. &#x201C;Now, dear daughter, you know you need my approval for this... It is okay. The both of you have my permission to use the special yurt, just this once. Don&#x2019;t make a habit of it though, and bear some consideration for those who have to clean up after you!&#x201D; He winks dramatically, and his booming laugh resounds throughout the yurt, joined by the cheers of the other tribesmen. The festive atmosphere of the dinner resumes. You release the girl&#x2019;s vicious hands and lean away from her in disgust. She does the same, her desire to cave your face in dissipated by her father&#x2019;s mockery.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am so glad to see the both of you getting along so lovingly,&#x201D; smiles Shun, radiating an aura of warmth and kindness. &#x201C;Are you blind?&#x201D; I snap. I regret the words the moment they spill out - Shun just laughs and mimes the loss of his eyesight, but the Duke of Xiliang glowers at me, displeased at the rude manner at which I just addressed the Crown Prince.<br>
<br>
The Ashina, on the other hand, are entertained at the entire spectacle. &#x201C;This is how it should be. Kids should be noisy and joyful, speaking as they wish. It is all part of growing up,&#x201D; says Huluzi, an out-of-place smile on his face. Bulun agrees eagerly by quaffing down more fermented milk. You let out a loud sigh and stand up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Where are you going?&#x201D; asks Yunzi irritably.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think you&#x2019;re right. Running around the plains with the horses would be better than sitting here with you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She scowls at you, and for an instant you remember the white horse that was stricken with some ailment. You feel the full awkward weight of your fourteen years in this world trying to get you to say something.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right, horses. How&#x2019;s the horse?&#x201D; you ask casually.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh.&#x201D; She understands which horse you mean instantly, but seems at a loss for words. Still, she musters enough composure to reply, &#x201C;She&#x2019;ll pull through. She&#x2019;s a strong one. Thank you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod your head in what you think is an apologetic manner, pleasantly surprised at her saying thanks. Perhaps she isn&#x2019;t so bad after all&#x2026; no.<br>
<br>
As you see her have a servant take your food away with an evil smile, as she glances back up at you innocently and asks, &#x201C;I thought you were going for a run? Why haven&#x2019;t you left yet?&#x201D;, you realize that you do hate her after all.<br>
<br>
You decide to go for that run and practice your newly acquired skill.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When you returned, the princess had retired to her own yurt - to your undisguised delight - and you were able to enjoy the leftover food and wine in peace. Perhaps you enjoyed it a little too much, as later that night you sit up attempting to stem an urgent signal from your bladder.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are awake?&#x201D; asks Shun - he is reading by candle-light. &#x201C;Yeah. What are you doing up?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Reading. You do it every night too. What&#x2019;s so surprising?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do it because I have to keep up with my studies. You know how harsh Old Zhao can get if you miss even a single stroke in the answers you write. You, on the other hand, are smarter than I am.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The prince laughs. &#x201C;Yet you get much the same scores as I do. I was just reading in about the traditions of the Ashina. Very interesting people. Do you remember the meaning of stepping onto her horse?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you have to remind me about that?&#x201D; you grumble, your bladder pounding. But he was still your prince and best friend, and you would sit here and listen to him finish even if it meant pissing blood. &#x201C;It was just some way to say &#x2018;I love you&#x2019; in Tujue style, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s like declaring a personal pledge to stay together for eternity, Jing. It&#x2019;s promising the stars and the moon for their love. The nomads may have many quirks, but hyperbole in their romantic life is not one of them. That is why it is very, very rarely attempted, and only when a person is truly serious.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t have done it if I knew,&#x201D; you mutter bitterly.<br>
<br>
The prince raises his eyebrows. &#x201C;Would you, now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course! Do you actually think I&#x2019;d be interested in her? Give me an older lady of experience any time,&#x201D; you snort.<br>
<br>
Shun stares at you, a teasing smile on his lips. &#x201C;Does that mean you will not mind if I marry her, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Go ahead, help yourself,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;But don&#x2019;t come running to me for help when you find her too much to handle.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm,&#x201D; Shun rubs his eyes. &#x201C;I see. That&#x2019;s disappointing. Well, don&#x2019;t let me keep you from relieving yourself. It must be getting unbearable. What, why are you shocked? The only time you wake up of your own will in the middle of the night is when you have to take a leak.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give him a rude gesture and run out of the tent. He is right, your bladder is about to burst.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You scramble to your feet, your fingers gingerly feeling the bleeding wound on your head. Realizing that your pants are still untied, you knot them back up, making sure to adjust the short sword&#x2019;s scabbard, and turn back to look at the camp. It is on fire. Someone or something had knocked you out halfway through your urination. Your chest hurts - the front of your robes seems to have been torn away - and there is a distinct, dark red imprint of a palm on your skin.<br>
<br>
Your heart pounding, you run back into the Ashina camp despite your injuries. There is fighting and shouting all over the place, and no one notices a fourteen year old boy slipping between the fires. It seems that the Ashina are fighting other Tujue. You recognize a Tang soldier in armour running past you. Grabbing him by the arm, you ask him what is going on. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s an enemy raid! The Duke of Xiliang and the Crown Prince are retreating from the eastern entrance right now! If you don&#x2019;t hurry, you&#x2019;ll be left behind!&#x201D; shouts the soldier as he barely slows down to explain things to you. He runs off, his feet pounding the ground as fast as they can take him.<br>
<br>
You begin to follow after him, but a scream stops you in your tracks. You would know that irritating voice anywhere - it&#x2019;s that stupid princess. Then, you hear Huluzi roar. Your impetuous curiosity getting the better of you, you crouch into the posture that Huluzi taught - the Yinglang Step - and tread quietly to a place where you can get a better view of what is going on.<br>
<br>
Just around the corner, you spot Huluzi and Yunzi fighting with a person clothed all in black. The enemy was wrapped in black cloth from head to toe, only revealing the eyes. Huluzi pushes Yunzi back, narrowly avoiding a kick from the person in black. He steps backwards and for an instant almost seems to disappear, dropping low to the ground and dashing to the side. Then, Huluzi pounces on his foe from their blind-side, his fists appearing to come from all directions.<br>
<br>
His attacks are so fast that your eyes are unable to keep up, but the person in black deflects them casually and gently, snaking their free arm in between his punches to redirect his attacks with light, well-timed pushes. The person in black presses three fingers together and jabs at Huluzi&#x2019;s outstretched left arm twice. He staggers back, his arm suddenly falling limp. Then, a powerful palm strikes his chest, sending him flying backwards into a burning yurt. You grab the grass on the ground tightly - do you go to his aid? Your duty is to the prince, but the prince is safe and sound with the Duke and his soldiers.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are a brave fighter, little Tujue girl. I came searching for the boy prince but found something more fun,&#x201D; says the person - no, woman - in black. She is advancing upon Yunzi now, talking in Han - she is definitely from the Central Plains and not a Tujue tribesperson. There is something else going on here&#x2026; this is not a simple raid. They are here for the prince. &#x201C;Do you want to come back with me? I can make you stronger. I can see the desire for strength in your eyes.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi snarls and her whip lashes out. The woman in black snares it from the air casually without even blinking her eyes, the whip smoking and crumbling in her vice-like grip.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Excellent spirit,&#x201D; coos the woman. &#x201C;You remind me of myself. I think I will take you back, whether you like it or not.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Should you do something? If you help Yunzi, it is only because you know that the Duke&#x2019;s hasty retreat without even trying to fight off the raid is not the way you should treat your allies. You aren&#x2019;t doing so out of any measure of goodwill towards that stupid brat. Helping the princess would endear you to the Ashina even more. On the other hand, as always, your place is by Shun&#x2019;s side. You should rightfully retreat to the eastern entrance as fast as you can, before they leave this place. That is the proper thing to do, as his companion&#x2026; though were he here, you know that he would ask you to jump the woman in black. In more ways than one, even.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Using the Yinglang Step, you sneak up behind the woman and stab her in the back with your short sword. There is no better way to distract someone than sending them to the underworld. On the off chance she survives, Yunzi is not out of the fight yet, and Huluzi may still make his way out of the tent. All three of you should stand a fair chance at forcing this kidnapping freak to retreat.<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> You flee to the eastern entrance, looking for the duke and the prince. This is not your fight. There is no need to get involved. You owe the Ashina nothing, and you are the prince&#x2019;s man. Your only priority is to make sure that he is secure and accompany him back to the capital, where you can forget about this blasted steppe once and for all.

            <h3>五 · A Parting with the Ashina</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					Hm, let&apos;s have the update then.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">A Parting with the Ashina</span></b><br>
<br>
Against your own better judgement, you circle around behind the woman in black. She is strong enough to defeat Huluzi in a few moves. She should be much stronger than you are. Perhaps it would be too much to hope that she would hold back against a boy in combat.<br>
<br>
You breathe in deeply.<br>
<br>
Your vision narrows.<br>
<br>
A mistake could mean the difference between life and death, but you feel strangely calm.<br>
<br>
Your breathing is composed. Slow. Just like Huluzi taught you. Step by step, you move towards the woman&#x2019;s back.<br>
<br>
She is stretching her hand towards Yunzi. That obnoxious girl, on the other hand, is babbling loudly in Tujue and making a point not to look behind the woman. Yunzi has probably noticed your approach.<br>
<br>
Three more steps.<br>
<br>
The woman whirls around to face you, though you are sure that you have done nothing to give your presence away. It looks like your skill isn&#x2019;t good enough after all. It&#x2019;s do or die now - there&#x2019;s no going back. You leap the last three steps, thrusting your short sword at your opponent.<br>
<br>
Your burst of speed in that three steps is enough to catch her by surprise, as she cannot do much more than dodge. The point of your blade catches the cloth covering her face as she spins away. Her mask is torn off.<br>
<br>
The woman underneath the mask does not seem that much older than you - she looks to be in her early twenties. Her features are beautiful but cold and cruel, marred only by a large red patch of skin that runs from under her right eye to her jaw. Her expression twists into one of hateful anger - you seem to be getting that a lot from females lately - as she jumps at you. You are not fast enough to escape her.<br>
<br>
The woman&#x2019;s palm smashes into your chest. The pain is intense, radiating from the point of impact like thorns digging their way into your body. Blood wells up in your throat and mouth, causing you to choke. You feel yourself, but the pain has been replaced by numbness throughout your body. Your fingers fumble and drop your sword. Through the paralyzing haze, you can see the woman standing over you. There is a puzzled expression on her exquisite face as she glances at her palm.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you not the boy I killed when we came in?&#x201D; she asks, but your tongue refuses to reply. &#x201C;No matter. I will kill you before you can grow up to break a woman&#x2019;s heart.&#x201D; Frowning, she raises her hand to deliver the finishing strike.<br>
<br>
Yunzi latches onto the woman&#x2019;s raised arm and bites into it.<br>
<br>
She screams, attempting to shake off the Ashina princess. The woman lands a few good blows on Yunzi, but none with that strange palm technique she used on you. Even when blood begins trickling down the girl&#x2019;s face, she refuses to let go, continuously attempting to drag the woman down.<br>
<br>
Well, you can&#x2019;t let that shrew one up you. You are <i>not</i> losing to her again. The haze begins to clear as sensation returns to your body. Of course, the sensation is that of terrible, excruciating pain. You grit your teeth and bear with it.<br>
<br>
You kick your foot out hard as the woman steps too close, catching her in the shin. At the same time, Yunzi lets go of her grip, taking advantage of the distraction to give a kick of her own. Her feet lodges solidly in the woman&#x2019;s abdomen. Your enemy staggers backwards, black cloth trailing in front of her. Taking advantage of the respite, you clamber to your feet, grabbing your short sword as you do so. Your knees are shaking, feeling like they are about to give out at any moment.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is impossible!&#x201D; cries the woman as she sees you back on your feet. &#x201C;No man has ever survived a second consecutive strike from my palm!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He is no man!&#x201D; retorts Yunzi, a bit too eagerly you think.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would like it if you didn&#x2019;t impugn my manhood on my behalf,&#x201D; you offer weakly, still too dizzy to be too indignant about her veiled insult.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is there anything there to impugn?&#x201D; she shrugs.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the woman laughs loudly, a crude, unhinged sound that is at odds with her beautiful appearance. &#x201C;I see! I see it clearly now! My dear sister in misfortune, you have already been taken in by this boy. Young as he may be, he has deceived you with his silvery tongue. This will only end in tears, I know the pattern all too well! All men betray. I will do you a favour and kill him right now. You will thank me for it when you realize what foul intents he had.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Her eyes are wild and steeped in hate as she focuses on you, projecting some sort of misplaced anger about wrongs long past onto your innocent self. Yunzi has been taken in by you? Is the woman blind and deaf, or is she just mad? Mad or not, however, she is a formidable opponent. Even though you are standing more than ten paces away from her, the woman&#x2019;s killing intent is unmistakable. You will not last a second against her in a straight fight, one on one. The sharpness of her intentions clears your head, however. That, at least, is a good thing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Huluzi taught you the Yinglang Step, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x201D; whispers Yunzi. &#x201C;Follow my lead.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that an order?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, just a suggestion,&#x201D; she replies with a tone that implies she&#x2019;ll happily watch me rot in the hells if I don&#x2019;t accept her suggestion.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then you can follow my lead.&#x201D; You compose yourself and run towards the woman first, ignoring the complaints of your creaking body. You can hear Yunzi cursing behind you. The woman&#x2019;s face twists gleefully as she prepares to strike at the silly boy coming straight at her.<br>
<br>
You recall what Huluzi attempted earlier.<br>
<br>
Crouching down low, you dart to the right at the very last moment. As the woman turns to follow you, Yunzi dashes to the left, having shadowed your steps closely. She immediately begins unleashing a flurry of attacks. The woman blocks her strikes expertly - Yunzi&#x2019;s Langya Fist is nowhere near Huluzi&#x2019;s level in strength and speed, and she dealt with that easily - but in that brief instant she is forced to take her eyes off you.<br>
<br>
Your sword flashes in a deadly arc. Unfortunately, the woman retracts her left arm at the moment she sees your swing begin - that is the only thing that prevents you from taking that limb off at the shoulder. You draw blood, the tip of your blade opening a gash in her upper arm. Grimacing, she bends her elbow and strikes at your sword hand like a snake - her fingers jab into the back of your palm. This causes your hand to open reflexively, dropping the sword.<br>
<br>
At the same time, the woman&#x2019;s right arm breaks past the princess&#x2019;s attacks and reaches out for her throat. You react instantly and pivot on one foot, swivelling around so that you can grab Yunzi&#x2019;s waist-sash. &#x201C;Watch your guard, you idiot girl!&#x201D; you yell as you pull her towards you, out of harm&#x2019;s way. &#x201C;<i>You</i> watch yourself, you stupid boy!&#x201D; Shouting at you in a decidedly unladylike manner, Yunzi pushes you down as the woman&#x2019;s palm narrowly misses your head while your back is still facing the enemy.<br>
<br>
You feel Yunzi step onto the palm of your hand uninvited; with a push, you help her soar above the woman&#x2019;s head. The woman instinctively reaches up to pull Yunzi down, but you grab her rising hand and pull, using your shoulder as leverage. As the woman&#x2019;s feet lift off the ground, Yunzi lands with an acrobatic backflip and throws a rising kick that lands solidly in the small of the woman&#x2019;s back, pushing her even further upwards.<br>
<br>
You finish the combination by hurling the woman over your shoulder with all your might. Helped along by Yunzi&#x2019;s kick, you should slam her into the ground with considerable force, enough to leave her dazed.<br>
<br>
You feel the woman&#x2019;s arm twist as she dislocates her own shoulder. She lands on her feet, with her limp arm still in your grasp. With a murderous smile, the woman strikes you. You feel a third palm hit you where the previous two had. This time the pain is even more intense than the last. You fly backwards, knocking Yunzi down as she gives out a short yelp. Your internal organs feel thoroughly shaken by the force of her attack - you cannot find it in you to even blink your eyelids. Yunzi tries frantically to get out from under you, but she doesn&#x2019;t have any strength left to lift you up.<br>
<br>
You cannot hear anything but a ringing in your ears. You can only watch as the woman calmly resets her dislocated arm without any change in her happy expression.<br>
<br>
A light shower begins to fall over the camp, hissing wherever it strikes fire. You feel a vague coldness chilling you to the bone.<br>
<br>
The woman shouts something gleefully, though she appears to be breathing rather heavily. Her posture isn&#x2019;t as powerful and threatening as it was. Of course, she is still strong enough to end your life with a single blow.<br>
<br>
You try to shift yourself again. If you&#x2019;re going to die, you don&#x2019;t want to die on top of that stupid scrawny girl scrabbling pointlessly under you. That would be humiliating.<br>
<br>
Again, her palm rises.<br>
<br>
Again, someone interferes.<br>
<br>
Li Shun barrels into the woman shoulder first, knocking her to the ground. Your worst fears begin to materialize.<br>
<br>
This is <i>not</i> good.<br>
<br>
She grabs hold of his wrist and twists it - you see his arm bend at an unnatural angle.<br>
<br>
This is not good <i>at all</i>.<br>
<br>
Your life is meant to be burnt away to make Shun&#x2019;s journey brighter. If he dies, you will be devoid of meaning in the eyes of the Emperor. If he dies, all that is left for you would be to get yourself fitted for a coffin to accompany Shun to the underworld.<br>
<br>
If that is the case, you might as well die trying to save him. One last good deed, as it were.<br>
<br>
Your limbs twitch as you force your body back up, straining against limits that you have never noticed. Every tendon in your body convulses in agony, every nerve screaming in pain, as you push the muscles in your body to work for your own selfish desires.<br>
<br>
For the third time, you rise from the woman&#x2019;s attack.<br>
<br>
She sees you standing and freezes up, disbelief and uncertainty in her eyes. Then, her gaze flickers, pointing somewhere behind you. You hear faint shouts and the sound of bowstrings drawn taut. Giving you a hateful glare, the woman jumps backwards and disappears into the darkness.<br>
<br>
You try to take a step towards Shun, who is kneeling in the mud, but your legs refuse to move.<br>
<br>
Is he alive?<br>
<br>
Your question is answered a brief second later as he looks up at you and smiles, just as cheerfully as ever. Cradling his broken arm, he gets up unsteadily. Your knees give way as you sink to the cold ground in relief. You are given a start when you feel a warm but skinny back push up against your own.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You make a lousy partner,&#x201D; Yunzi mutters tiredly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do they teach the Ashina to dance like bulls?&#x201D; you reply, your own voice cracking and weak. You are getting sleepy as the adrenaline drains from your body. Even the pain doesn&#x2019;t seem like it can keep you awake.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, this must be your renowned silvery tongue that the madwoman spoke of.&#x201D; Yunzi laughs lightly, the first time you have heard her do so. Her laughter is high and clear, unlike the bellowing guffaws of her father.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is an impressive tongue. Are you deceived yet?&#x201D; You try to taunt her intellect with as much as you can muster.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Only in your dreams,&#x201D; she bites back, with real venom in her voice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did I miss something?&#x201D; asks Shun as he staggers over, looking down at you and Yunzi sitting back-to-back with open amusement.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You missed plenty, but you won&#x2019;t be missing my execution. You shouldn&apos;t have come back for me. It&apos;s just a waste of your arm.&#x201D; You give Shun a guilty, apologetic grin as you make a weak gesture at his arm. Shun shakes his head, &#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be alright. You&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201D; Of course, you know that he is lying. You have allowed his royal body to be harmed - that will not be taken lightly by the Emperor. The Duke of Xiliang arrives in full armour and an escort of a dozen soldiers, his expression seething with barely restrained anger. If Shun were not the Crown Prince and future Emperor of the Tang dynasty, you think the duke would probably have screamed a furious lecture at him on the merits of not being a reckless idiot. Surprisingly, he does not even spare you, the reckless idiot, a glance.<br>
<br>
<i>So, that is how it is</i>, you think.<br>
<br>
You close your weary eyes.<br>
<br>
The rain continues to fall.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You can barely move the next morning - only enough to hobble painfully and slowly. Huluzi survived, regaining consciousness once the fight was over; there are fresh pink scars all over his burnt body, and his complexion is sickly and pale, but at least he is moving about more actively than you are.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You will always be a welcome friend at our tribe,&#x201D; says Bulun as he claps both of your shoulders with his big hands. You wince in pain, finding it in yourself to still bring out a smile. &#x201C;I thought I would be as good as family,&#x201D; you joke.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, that comes eventually,&#x201D; he whispers conspiratorially. &#x201C;Once you&#x2019;ve married Yunzi. No need to rush things, eh?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Your face drops into a frown. &#x201C;I am sorry, great khan, but your daughter really has no interest in marrying me. It would not work out, and I fear you would only waste your valuable time on such fanciful notions.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bulun&#x2019;s grin widens. &#x201C;Funny. That sounds just like what she said to me earlier this morning. Yunzi told me very clearly that you are not interested in her.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She is absolutely right. That is the only point on which we will ever agree,&#x201D; you offer, in hopes that the khan will finally listen.<br>
<br>
Bulun stares at you and sighs heavily. He looks slightly dejected. &#x201C;Very well, I won&#x2019;t press the issue any further. Before we part ways, there is one last thing.&#x201D; He beckons to Huluzi, who walks over calmly and holds out his hand. In his palm lies a single sharp fang hanging from a woven string. There is a single symbol carved on it in Tujue script.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A wolf&#x2019;s fang,&#x201D; says Huluzi. &#x201C;Engraved upon it is the word for &#x2018;sky&#x2019;, the symbol of the Ashina. Keep it with you and remember that you are an eternal friend to the descendants of the wolf. Should you call, we will answer.&#x201D; You accept the rare amulet gratefully, bowing your head as you do so. &quot;Will you be alright?&quot; asks Huluzi, his piercing gaze focused upon you knowingly. You bow your head again. &quot;I will be fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
You know that you will not return here again.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The Duke of Xiliang stands aside, letting you hobble back into the carriage painfully. He no longer looks at you in an angry and contemptuous way; now, his gaze is that of a man looking dispassionately at a dying dog by the side of the street.<br>
<br>
You understand that you fully deserve every last bit of that look. Shun&#x2019;s arm was broken. The <i>Crown Prince</i>&#x2019;s arm was broken in attempting to rescue his companion, the boy who was to serve as both his friend and protector. Mere lashes will not suffice to express the depths of your failure. There will be a reckoning.<br>
<br>
Of course, you could run. You could even stay with the Ashina, who would be more than pleased to shelter you. The Imperial Court would not risk their new-found allies over a foolish, incompetent servant.<br>
<br>
But that is not what your oath allows. That is not the full measure of your loyalty.<br>
<br>
The Emperor bought you. Shun owns you. No matter what comes, that is a fundamental truth of your being that will never change.<br>
<br>
Duty and punishment come hand in hand. To shirk one and expect to escape the other is something you can never allow for yourself.<br>
<br>
That is the fate you have made with your own hands.<br>
<br>
That is the price you pay to continue living.<br>
<br>

            <h3>一 · Punishment and Exile</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Punishment and Exile</span></b><br>
<br>
First came the beatings. One hundred strikes with a large stick. By the end of it, your back was torn and bleeding, your bones cracked in a dozen different places. The scars would be permanent.<br>
<br>
Next was the stockade. Before you had fully recovered, you were manacled to a wooden stockade in the middle of a market square for a week. Day after day, you were pelted with the finest of Chang&#x2019;an&#x2019;s produce. Rotten, wormy cabbages and slimy, stinking eggs were just the least of their selections.<br>
<br>
Then, while the Emperor thought about which part of you he should cut off and how slow the torturer should go while doing it, you were thrown in the Cold Dungeon without a stitch to wear. It was named such due to its construction - the walls were chilly even in summer, freezing in winter. The only thing the guards allowed you, in their infinite mercy, was the wolf&#x2019;s fang amulet you had received from the Ashina.<br>
<br>
You stir from your stupor, shuddering from the coldness of the fang resting against your chest. The wounds inflicted by the woman in black have almost healed, though you still feel a shortness of breath every now and then. Your punishment hasn&#x2019;t been conducive to a speedy recovery. There is a creak of wood on metal as the cell door opens.<br>
<br>
Prince Shun walks in, wrapped up warmly in wool and silk and carrying a bunch of rags in his hands. There are melting white flakes on his hair and shoulders - it has started snowing outside. Of course, it makes no difference to you in here; the cell is as frigid as ever. He tosses the rags at you. &#x201C;I do not want to have to look at your shrivelled...ness.. while talking to you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh, grateful for any warmth that you can get. Wrapping the rags around yourself, you ask Shun, &#x201C;Have they decided on the last punishment, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It looks like they&#x2019;re going with the pig.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You wince. &#x201C;Searing my ears, clipping my tongue, and then throwing me into a pigsty for the male boars to have their way with me for a month? I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll be very useful to you after that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;His Majesty says you will still be able to read and write, and as such, only marginally less useless than you are right now. As your friend, I petitioned him for the dragon, but you are too low-born to get such a consideration.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey now, you really want my head mounted in your study?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;d be nice to see you all the time, though I suppose you wouldn&#x2019;t be a sparkling conversationalist then.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Absolutely not, unless you can figure out a way to have my head recite the Classics to you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a laugh, Shun sits down opposite you, ignoring the dirt and grime on the ground.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, why are you really here?&#x201D; You cut straight to the point of his visit. You know he didn&#x2019;t come for a meaningless chat.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We still have no leads on the people who attacked the Ashina camp that night or what their true aim was,&#x201D; Shun says, nodding. &#x201C;The woman who broke my arm was clearly a master from the Central Plains, but by all accounts she is not a member of any orthodox sect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t think so, from her behaviour and moves,&#x201D; you agree. &#x201C;but it is possible that she disguised her stances.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is true,&#x201D; the prince admits. &#x201C;Unfortunately we do not have much contact with the pugilistic world; the Emperor has been content to let them do as they wish for years while he hides away with his little superstitious toys. That old fool.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, he bought me because of what those toys told him. And he might just be right, I mean, look at my luck.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun looks exasperated as he grabs you by the shoulders. &#x201C;I have told you this many times, Jing. You are not cursed with bad luck. All you are is a person who has encountered misfortune, and there is no evidence that will happen till the day you die. You are focusing overwhelmingly on the bad things that happen to you and not the good - that is why you think your luck is poor. Superstitious nonsense is going to drag our country into the grave, and I don&#x2019;t need that from you of all people.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait, you don&#x2019;t believe in the gods or ghosts, then?&#x201D; you grin. You know he is deathly scared of ghosts.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, no. I mean, I do believe in gods, and ghosts. But I don&#x2019;t believe that fate controls us. We are what we make of ourselves,&#x201D; mutters Shun. &#x201C;I would rather work the fields than pray to the Jade Emperor for good fortune. Anyway, we are meandering from the point. Shut up and listen for a bit, Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, Your Highness.&#x201D; You clam up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If the martial arts sects are getting involved in palace politics, this bodes ill. Their strength is considerable; even if we marshalled all of our armies at the moment, we would not be able to subdue them without a bloodbath on both sides. If we are weakened, well&#x2026;&#x201D; He looks at the wolf&#x2019;s fang hanging from your neck.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose the Tujue would take advantage. We cannot afford to force the sects to comply,&#x201D; you reason. &#x201C;The sects themselves know it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; nods Shun. &#x201C;But I don&#x2019;t think we can afford to do nothing either. I don&#x2019;t have many resources I can call on right now, and only one resource I can trust.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You grasp what he is saying immediately. &#x201C;You are sending me to investigate the sects?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Secretly, I suppose. Or rather, I want you to infiltrate the pugilistic world.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about my punishment, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thankfully, it all works out. I have expressed my displeasure to the Emperor about your performance, but due to your prior history of service and depth of bonds with me, I do not want you hurt. Well, any more than you already are. As far as the palace is concerned, you will be barred from ever setting sight on its gates again upon pain of death,&#x201D; explains the prince.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is rather lenient,&#x201D; you say. &quot;Are you sure that is alright?&quot;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It does mean that we probably won&#x2019;t be able to contact each other until I take the throne and give you an official pardon. I don&apos;t expect to hear from you for a few years, at least... we will be planning for the future with this move. It is not an easy decision for me to make, and I had to call in many favours and promise even more. Still, it was either this, or letting you be a pig&#x2019;s whore.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You sigh. &#x201C;Are you sure about this, Shun? You will be alone in the palace, and I don&#x2019;t mean in terms of companionship. I could watch your back even with a clipped tongue and a sore posterior.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know that, but&#x2026; this has to be done. I need you to do this. I can find people to watch my back out of self-interest, but I cannot find another friend who I can trust to act for my best interests without supervision, out there in the world. Don&#x2019;t worry. I know how to handle myself. I have provisioned for you some supplies and a map. Furthermore, there is an admission letter that will gain you entrance to the major orthodox sects that have a tentative understanding with the Imperial Court.&#x201D; Shun pulls out the letter in question and a list of places where it would be applicable.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem really prepared,&#x201D; you say. This is as close to an actual order as you have ever heard him give you, and you do not plan to disobey. You owe Shun that much. If doing your loyal duty means that you have to part from him, so be it. You resolve yourself to leaving the capital.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Time is of the essence, Jing. You will be leaving tonight, before the Emperor changes his mind. Where do you plan to go?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look at the list&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Shaolin Temple. Renowned as the originator of martial arts in the Central Plains, the Buddhist monks of Shaolin are known for their ability with unarmed fighting and staves. Some of the most powerful martial arts can be found in Shaolin. However, they have extremely strict rules, and frequently expel those who cannot abide by their laws.<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> Wudang Sect. The Taoist priests on Mount Wudang have developed techniques based around Taiji. Harmonizing yin and yang, Wudang emphasizes mastery of balance as its initiates learn how to redirect the flow of their opponent&#x2019;s attacks. Sword and unarmed techniques are the staple of Wudang.<br>
<br>
<b>C.</b> Huashan Sect. The noble swordsmen of Mount Hua have trained long and hard to develop their reputation as one of the most powerful sects in the pugilistic world. Their weapon techniques are malleable and flexible, and their masters are reputed to be lethal swordsmen even with a stick in hand. Though the sword is the sect&#x2019;s main focus, they also dabble in sabers and spears.<br>
<br>
<b>D.</b> Beggars&#x2019; Sect. The beggars are a widespread union that spans the entirety of the country. Beggars&#x2019; Sect members can be found in every city, and their information network is unmatched. You have to become a beggar to join. The Beggars&#x2019; Sect emphasizes staves, thrown weapons and unarmed fighting in their techniques.<br>
<br>
<b>E.</b> You will not join any of the recommended major sects - the woman who participated in the attack was likely from the darker side of the pugilistic world. Exploring on your own could yield better results than seeking out the orthodox sects. You will wander the roads yourself, enjoy your freedom, and see what you can find out on your adventures. It would be more interesting than begging or being stuck on a mountain with stupid rules for a couple of years anyway.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Killer Physician</span></b><br>
<br>
Chang&#x2019;an is a week&#x2019;s old memory by now, on your lone hike south in search of adventure. Fortunately, it seems that adventure has found you at the beginning of your travels.<br>
<br>
You hear screams. Laughter. You remember the caravan lurching, and then crashing. A heavy boot sinks into the mud in front of your face. A thick stench of wet fur, grime and sweat assaults your nostrils as grubby fingers fumble at your clothes. You stir, groaning. You know it would be a bad idea to get up - it&#x2019;s good way to get a knife in your throat. Not that you could, anyway. The pain in your chest has suddenly returned with a painful vengeance. Not passing out again is all you can hope to do.<br>
<br>
The other passengers on the caravan are being beaten and kicked into submission. Out of the corner of your eye, you spot two bandits having their way with a wailing young woman. You recall that she was sitting opposite you and that the both of you had conversed, though you do not recall her name at the moment.<br>
<br>
The fingers withdraw with your pouch. With a greedy sneer, the man empties the contents into his palm. The sneer is wiped out and his eyes widen as a flow of silver coins spill out. He must not have been expecting much. &#x201C;&#x2018;ey, boss! We&#x2019;ve got a rich boy here!&#x201D; The last thing to drop out of the pouch is a piece of paper, folded tightly. Before he can unfold it, the paper is snatched out of his hands by another bandit.<br>
<br>
The newcomer has a belly that can rival a pig&#x2019;s and enough hair to be mistaken for a beast. Despite his bloated body, his gaze is anything but lazy; it is sharp and brutal. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s it say, boss?&#x201D; asks the first bandit. The bandit leader&#x2019;s fingers are surprisingly slender - opening up the paper, he begins to pore over the admission letter. Even though you did not want to use it, you had kept it, just in case it would come in handy.<br>
<br>
The bandit leader shrugs, a strange calm coming over the fat man&#x2019;s posture. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how to read those fancy characters they use. There&#x2019;s the seal of the Imperial Court, though. This kid&#x2019;s something. Strip him, see if he&#x2019;s got anything else interesting.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are roughly hauled up into a sitting position as they remove your clothing in a surprisingly gentle manner. &#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t want to damage the cloth. It&#x2019;s good cloth,&#x201D; explains a rat-faced thug with a scar twisting his lips. There is a collective whistle as your back is revealed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Look at &#x2018;em scars, boss. Thought he was a brat of good breeding,&#x201D; whispers one of the bandits loudly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Could be an accident,&#x201D; chimes another.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nah.&#x201D; The bandit leader shakes his jowls. &#x201C;Nah. They&#x2019;re from a beating. Sticks, I expect. This boy is not high-born. They wouldn&#x2019;t scar one of them nobles, not like that. Found anything?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nothing nice. There&#x2019;s this thing around his neck, though,&#x201D; says the rat-faced bandit as he reaches for your Ashina amulet. Not that. Your hand shoots up and grips his wrist tightly, causing the bandit to give an unmanly shriek. Without warning, you feel a boot land on the side of your temple, jarring your skull. A burst of pain shoots through your head as you are thrown to the ground.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not a docile one, is he, Shuzhui? Leave it. Let the kid have his worthless trinket,&#x201D; says the bandit leader, laughing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;re we going to do with this boy, boss?&#x201D; asks a tall, thin bandit with a pencil thin moustache. &#x201C;Ransom? Or make him join our gang? Little Mu made a gift of his own head to the guards just last week, we&#x2019;re short a scout. This one looks like he can handle himself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The fat man looks at the letter in his hands again, his eyes resting on the seal. Then, he rips up the paper. The fragments are scattered across the mud, turning them illegible. &#x201C;Too risky, Zhang. We are running a tight ship, my brothers. The kid&#x2019;s bound to be connected. Someone might come looking for him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Kill him, then?&#x201D; grunts Rat-Face.<br>
<br>
The leader&#x2019;s eyes gleam viciously as he smiles. &#x201C;Not here. They find his stiff here, we&#x2019;re going to have a hard time making our honest livelihood in the future. Slit the throats of the other passengers, but <i>this </i>one is going missing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
After an hour&#x2019;s trek through the forest, you find yourself bound and gagged, stripped of all possessions except for your amulet and standing on the precipice of a very steep cliff. Your heart is pounding furiously as you stare at the drop. It would take many seconds to reach the bottom. Sharp, jagged rocks and stunted tree branches line the cliff&#x2019;s side. A man could easily end up broken <i>before </i>he hits ground. The bandit leader places one hand on your shoulder, standing quietly behind you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re lucky, the fall will kill you. There are wolves in this area. You don&#x2019;t want to be alive when they find you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You scream a muffled curse at the man.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Curse the misfortune of your birth, dog of the Court.&#x201D; His voice is a low and lethal whisper, spoken for your ears only. Then, he gives you a shove.<br>
<br>
It is a long way down.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You feel something warm being placed over your forehead. You are lying down on a straw mat - still naked - but where? The last thing you remember is hitting the ground, having broken more than a few branches - and much of your bones - on your way down. Then, in the mists of pain and darkness, you heard a faint growling.<br>
<br>
Strangely, your body doesn&#x2019;t feel shattered to you. In fact, you feel better than you have ever been. Was it all a dream? Are you going to wake up back in the palace?<br>
<br>
Your eyes snap open. You meet the gaze of a girl swaddled in rags - between her messy long hair and the amount of cloth wrapped around her, you can only make out her large, glistening eyes. She seems flustered at your awakening. Making a ghastly croaking sound akin to that of a dying frog, she backs away from you and flees.<br>
<br>
You seem to be in a hut somewhere in the woods. You can hear birdsong; judging from the brightness, it is early morning. The hut is unfurnished - it doesn&#x2019;t look like it has been lived in.<br>
<br>
Moments later, a tall, old man whose hair has turned entirely white walks in. His posture is upright and his face is stern. The girl follows behind him, taking care not to look at you. The old man kneels by the side of the straw mat and grabs your right wrist roughly. Gripping it with two wrinkled fingers, he closes his eyes and takes your pulse.<br>
<br>
You wonder if they saved you. Remembering your manners, you open your mouth to thank the old man, but he hisses at you. &#x201C;Silence! Do not make a peep, you brat!&#x201D; Surprised, you swallow your words of gratitude. With a harrumph, the old man lets go of your wrist.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You would be dead if not for me,&#x201D; he states flatly. You bow your head. &#x201C;Thank-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you know what is wrong with you, boy?&#x201D; snaps the old man before you can finish your sentence.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I... fell off a cliff?&#x201D; you conjecture.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, that,&#x201D; snorts the old man dismissively. &#x201C;If I couldn&#x2019;t fix <i>that</i> I might as well retire. Your body should be as good as new, though I can&#x2019;t do anything about the old scars that have already set in. No. What is wrong with you is <i>inside </i>you.&#x201D; He jabs at your chest painfully with his finger.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your qi is a great big mess! I&#x2019;ve never seen internal energy so chaotic. Yes, all people have both yin and yang within them, but yours are not only equal, they are in constant opposition with each other! It&#x2019;s a freak of nature, that&#x2019;s what it is. Let your qi rage uncontrolled and your meridians would blow up and kill you. No <i>wonder </i>they were congested, you would be long dead if they weren&#x2019;t!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Meridians blow up?&#x201D; That&#x2019;s something new to you - you thought they were merely channels for qi. The old man turns the full force of his glare upon you. &#x201C;Of course they do. Are you questioning my knowledge, boy? I am the Killer Physician, Yao Shunshi! Ignore my advice at your own peril.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Stroking his beard rather smugly after having declared his identity - though you have never heard of him in your life - he continues. &#x201C;The energies from your core, your dantian, are now impossible for me to seal up or control. It would be like attempting to tame a raging ocean by slapping it. I doubt even the Taoists at Wudang, experts that they are at harmonizing yin and yang, can fully subdue your wayward internal energy. I have given you pills that will suppress your qi for now, but I am afraid this condition is rather permanent. It&#x2019;s unfortunate that I accidentally cleared the congestion in my attempt to heal you with my qi in the first place.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2026; what?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now, boy, don&#x2019;t take that tone with me. You were about to go down and meet King Yanluo when I got to you. I had to stabilize your vital signs. Besides that, you also had the poisonous remnant of another person&#x2019;s internal energy circulating around your system, like a drop of oil mixed into a lake. I had to expunge it to heal you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
That must be an effect of the woman in black&#x2019;s palm strikes. This would be a good chance to ask about it, you think. &#x201C;I&#x2026; was attacked by someone and wounded by their palms,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Do you know anything about the internal energy you found?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hmph,&#x201D; sniffs Yao as he strokes his beard again. &#x201C;As if I wouldn&#x2019;t! You have been whoring, haven&#x2019;t you, boy? No need to be shy about it. I suppose you <i>are</i> of that age...&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, not recently. What does that have to do with anything?&#x201D; you ask in puzzlement.<br>
<br>
Yao sighs and shakes his head, an elegant gesture that seems to perfectly exemplify his disdain for the ignorance of youths nowadays. &#x201C;You were struck by the Yuhua Duqing Palm (&#x7389;&#x82B1;&#x7368;&#x60C5;&#x638C;, Jade Flower Sole Love Palm). It&#x2019;s a technique particular to the ladies of Yuhua Hall, the most popular brothel in Jiangnan. Did you cross one of their ladies? You must have. Here&#x2019;s some advice. Pay up when you&#x2019;re done.&#x201D; You hear an embarrassed squeak from the girl sitting in the corner. She seems to be staring intently at the floor, drawing circles with her finger.<br>
<br>
That sounds interesting. It looks like Yuhua Hall is your next destination. Turning back to the Killer Physician, you begin to smile. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how to-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He interrupts you by grabbing your left wrist. You feel a sharp, aching pain shooting through your arm. &#x201C;Oh, I know exactly how you can repay me. Do you know why they call me the Killer Physician? When I save a life, I take another as payment, to balance the world. I spent half my cache of herbs to save your life&#x2026; and <i>unfortunately</i>, the one who begged me to save you was my idiot apprentice Cao&#x2019;er over there.&#x201D; He jerks his thumb at the girl, who shakes her head furiously and continues staring at the floor, as if it will open up and swallow her into a nice hiding spot if she looks at it long enough.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t go killing my precious heir and inheritor of my knowledge, boy. So, I will make a once-in-a-lifetime exception and have you work it off in other ways. You came at a right time - I will need an extra hand for some dangerous work in the future. From now on, you will be my second apprentice. Now... I can see that you are a wild one. If I let you be, you will flee in the night, thinking that you are some sort of untameable stallion. Young people. Hah.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You <i>had </i>considered that, but you keep your eyes steady and focused on him without saying anything in return. He lets go of your wrist, the one that had hurt.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Take a look at that purple dot on your skin. It will grow day by day, turning into a ring that encircles your wrist. When it is complete, you will die. Horribly. The only way to prevent it from growing is with a temporary antidote that I have, and I am the only person who knows how to remove the poison entirely.&#x201D; His hand stops stroking the damnable beard, and a sly smile sprouts on his face. &#x201C;You will work for me until the day I deem your debt repaid.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Who knows how many years that will be? Even so, from the confident look on his face you know that it is useless to protest. You will have to bide your time for now and follow. The old man gets up, grinning crazily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now, if you are done being surprised, get up! You are perfectly healthy now and have no excuse lying around being an invalid. We have work to do, places to go. There is an old woman with a cold in a nearby village that needs my attention.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who are you going to kill for that?&#x201D; you ask. Master Yao gives you a glare. &#x201C;Are you dense? The bloody woman isn&#x2019;t going to die from her cold. I take payment for minor ailments, taels only. How else would I eat?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Yao turns out to be a rather tough master. The three of you wander from place to place according to his whims, curing little ills as you go. Apparently, it is rare that someone actually seeks him out in order to save lives - his price is known and few are willing to pay it. However, you cannot deny that his skills are bordering on the realm of the divine; he makes even the most reputable Imperial doctor look like a quack in comparison. During your travels, you perform many odd jobs and learn many things about herbalism and acupuncture, but you find yourself being relied upon to do a certain type of task in particular.<br>
<br>
(Herbalism +2, Pressure Points +2)<br>
(Neigong +1, but cannot be raised any higher for now)<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Both Yao and Cao&#x2019;er are really quite bad at talking to people. Horrendous, actually. You find yourself often being the face of your little physician troupe in socializing, negotiating and haggling for payment with stingy peasants and rich merchants alike. You begin to talk more smoothly and think more quickly, being forced to mentally calculate the proper compensation for the value of the herbs used and services rendered... and in some sadly frequent cases, especially when it comes to the merchants, acquire the unpaid monies subtly. (CHA +1, INT+1, Speech +2, Sleight-of-Hand +1, Sneak +1)<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You often take the job of travelling deep into the wilds in order to gather rare herbs and animals. The isolation of the mountains sharpen your senses. You become more perceptive of colours and sounds and movement, as you set traps for snakes and other animals - but more commonly snakes. You become able to identify your target herbs and animals from a distance. The long treks in the wild also improves your endurance, as you frequently find yourself returning under a heavy load of materials collected for Master Yao. (PER +1, END +1, Herbalism +1, Sneak +1, Traps +2)<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
In addition to medicine, the Killer Physician also proves to be rather adept at the art of killing. There are those who would refuse to pay his price after his work is complete. These he would end; by force if necessary, though he takes only the life he is owed. You have yet to encounter Master Yao putting his reputation as the Killer Physician in practice, as all you have dealt with so far are common ailments, but you know he is of considerable skill as a martial artist. The first technique he imparts to you is the Jinshetuipi (&#x91D1;&#x86C7;&#x86FB;&#x76AE;, Golden Snake Shedding Skin). It is an unorthodox qinggong technique that specializes in avoiding an enemy&apos;s clutches via erratic movements - he perceived your high agility and deemed it useful for you. You accepted the technique with little hesitation; you had lost your scroll for the Yinglang Step together with the rest of your possessions when the bandits attacked. You had memorized many of the drawings, but what you could replicate was an incomplete technique.<br>
<br>
This was not the only skill you learned. You were also offered the chance to learn:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Duancao Legs. (&#x65B7;&#x8349;&#x817F;, Grass Breaking Legs) A physician&apos;s hands are to cure, not to kill. So said Master Yao&apos;s own master, though Yao doesn&apos;t seem to abide by that maxim. The Grass Breaking Legs is a kicking technique that is quick and sharp. True masters of this ability would be able to cut pliable grass by the force of their kicks alone.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Jiudu Silver Needles. (&#x4E5D;&#x6BD2;&#x9280;&#x91DD; Nine Poison Silver Needles) A deadly poison technique created by concocting nine basic poisons. One strike in the proper point will kill any man not versed in the art of self-defense. The needles soaked in the poison can be used in close combat, or thrown, if the practitioner has skill with throwing weapons.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Yuhe Finger (&#x7652;&#x5408;&#x6307;, Healing Finger) A neigong dependant finger technique that transmits internal energy to a pressure point when struck. Practitioners will focus on the ability to cure ailments and manipulate a person&apos;s qi into a healthier arrangement.<br>

					Time&apos;s up. I suppose kicking it is.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">A Call for Help</span></b><br>
<br>
Winter turns to spring, and then to summer. As autumn draws to a close and the winds begin to bring a hint of the coming cold, you find yourself on the outskirts of Xuchang, the latest city where Master Yao&#x2019;s wanderings have taken you. A well-off merchant by the name of Gu Zhan had taken sick and heard of the famed Killer Physician&#x2019;s presence in the city. Living up to his reputation, Master Yao had healed the man with some efficacious herbal brews. Then, he advised the man rather loudly that he should purchase some of these herbs for his mistress, who must have transmitted the clap to him.<br>
<br>
That did not go well. It took all of your charm and patience - not much of the latter, you&#x2019;ll admit - to negotiate safe exit from the merchant&#x2019;s manor. You didn&#x2019;t even get paid.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master,&#x201D; you sigh loudly, &#x201C;did you do that on purpose? I have told you many times to mind your bedside manners. Perhaps it would be better if you concentrated on the healing and left the talking to me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao snorts loudly as he lights up the book of alchemy he had brought along to read and tosses it to the roadside with utter disregard for fire safety. &#x201C;If his mistress is not kept well enough that she attracts stray flies like rotting meat, that is not my fault. I gave him a proper warning, like a physician should do. Rubbish. Utter rubbish, this book is.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Subtlety, Master.&#x201D; You know you are not the <i>best </i>person to talk about subtlety, but the time you have spent with Yao and Cao&#x2019;er has been very enlightening.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Subtlety, eh?&#x201D; Master Yao suddenly grins slyly. &#x201C;When did you do it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have sharp eyes, my master,&#x201D; you say, as you open up your palm to show a little pouch. &#x201C;You were making a big fuss and crying bloody murder as they tried to beat your head in. In all that ruckus, no one was looking at the box. It was the best choice I could have made, considering the circumstances. I&#x2019;m not going without dinner tonight; we didn&apos;t even have enough money to buy this chicken when we walked into the city.&quot; You shake the bag containing your dinner in his face. &quot;The two of you have been spending a lot of taels on buying books and then <i>burning them after reading</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I made that fuss on <i>purpose</i>, stupid disciple of mine,&#x201D; says Yao, ignoring your concerns over finances and book burning. &#x201C;You still have much to learn about the ways of the world, but it is good that you no longer hesitate to procure what should be rightfully ours.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You open the pouch and count the coins within. &#x201C;Slightly more than what is rightfully ours, it seems.&#x201D; At that, Yao frowns. &#x201C;You know what to do, Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll pass the surplus coins to one of Gu&#x2019;s servants. If it makes it back to him, good. If it doesn&#x2019;t, he was paying his servants too little anyway. You know, they&#x2019;re starting to call you the Thieving Physician.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And yet they ask for me anyway. How can they complain?&#x201D; laughs your master. He does have a point. Despite his unorthodox, eccentric reputation, the Killer Physician Yao Shunshi is in high demand. This is not because his prices are cheap. Indeed, they are frequently exorbitant and fluctuate wildly depending on how much he likes his patients. It is rare for him to like his patients.<br>
<br>
Master Yao is sought after because of two traits of his.<br>
<br>
Firstly, he will never refuse a call for help. No matter how minor, how major, or how dangerous the situation is, he will heed the call. Back during the summer, he led you and Cao&#x2019;er right into the middle of a turf war between two gangs over a peasant&#x2019;s fever. You had to kick your way out of several excitingly dangerous events that temporarily quenched your thirst for reckless adventure.<br>
<br>
Secondly, you have never seen him fail, not even once. His reputation is such that no one has ever found an illness he could not treat. Master Yao once boasted that if death was an ailment instead of the natural end of life, he could cure it.<br>
<br>
These two traits combined meant that if you called for him in time, he <i>would</i> come, and he <i>would</i> heal you.<br>
<br>
As the two of you approach the abandoned hut outside Xuchang that serves as your temporary - and more importantly, free - lodgings while you are in the area, you spot a pillar of smoke rising towards the heavens. That is probably the last of the books that they bought. Yao and Cao&#x2019;er have a remarkable memory. The both of them are able to memorize pages and pages with just a single glance. Every year, they would spend a considerable amount of money to purchase all of the updated manuals, and memorize them. Then, they would burn the books. When you asked why, Yao just said that it was an offering, and nothing more.<br>
<br>
You see Cao&#x2019;er fanning the flames of the fire. When she spots you and Master Yao approaching, she gives a slight nod of the head before turning her undivided attention back to the flames&#x2026; though you can still spot her stealing glances at you out of the side of her eyes. Your master goes back into the hut, grumbling as usual, while you go over to his senior apprentice. Despite being two years younger than you are, she is <i>far</i>, <i>far </i>better than you can ever be in the arts of healing. She can concoct a good batch of qi-suppressing pills and temporary antidotes for you within hours, while it would take you perhaps a full day of trial and error. However, her excellent memory and enormous skill at medicine is not the only reason why Master Yao took her in - Cao&#x2019;er had been born with what your master calls Immortal&#x2019;s Eyes. She is able to perceive the meridians and the flow of qi with just her eyes alone, and he often brags that she will grow up to become an even more famous physician than he is. But for now...<br>
<br>
You sniff the air. As expected, she hasn&#x2019;t been keeping up her bathing regimen. The girl just seems to hate water in general. Earlier on you had taken it upon yourself to scrub her clean personally, but, well&#x2026; girls grow, as they always do.<br>
<br>
You blanch at the memory of Master Yao sniggering and pushing the responsibility of explaining a girl&#x2019;s flowering to a fourteen year old boy. Thankfully she had already learnt of such things from all that reading she does.<br>
<br>
You place a firm hand on her greasy, tangled hair, causing the girl to freeze up and turn red. &#x201C;...yes?&#x201D; As always, her voice is meek and hoarse from disuse. She always sounds like a dying frog when she speaks, which is not often.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did you follow my instructions?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Head-shake.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;...forgot.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Go do it now, or the only thing they&#x2019;ll be calling you in the future is the Stinky Physician,&#x201D; you order with a laugh. Cao&#x2019;er bows to you and runs off, keeping her eyes glued to the ground all the while. You had been an only child while with your real parents, and with Shun it was like having a brother your age. This is the first time you&#x2019;ve had something akin to a younger sibling. It&#x2019;s a strange feeling - you&#x2019;re not sure that you enjoy herding her around, but you&#x2019;re not sure that you dislike it either.<br>
<br>
Of course, Master Yao isn&#x2019;t anything like a parent. More like a grumpy, troublesome uncle with a malicious streak.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The roasting chicken fills the air with a pleasant aroma. As you turn it over the fire, Cao&#x2019;er returns from her bath. Her hair is no longer greasy, though it is as messy as ever. She has swapped into the <i>other </i>bundle of thick rags that she wears - you&#x2019;ve put that out to dry. Prior to your arrival Cao&#x2019;er had taken care of the daily chores, but you soon discovered that she did it rather absent-mindedly. You are unsure how someone so well-versed at the art of brewing potions can be so bad at cooking.  Thankfully, you had spent some time with the maids in the kitchen and picked up a thing or two.<br>
<br>
<i>My dear brother Shun, if only you could see me now. I am not sure if you would laugh or cry</i>, you think as you split up the chicken like a good wife. A big portion for the growing girl, a middling one for the growing boy, and the chicken&#x2019;s posterior for the old master. He raises his white eyebrows as you serve the hindquarters to him. &#x201C;We need the nutrition, master,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
He gives a big, dramatic shrug in return and tucks in, muttering about cocky kids. You&#x2019;ve learnt Yao&#x2019;s boundaries as a master - he may be harsh and demanding when it came to professional skills, but in daily living he is as carefree as a bird and eats like one. As long as you performed his tasks and did it without complaint, he would be satisfied.<br>
<br>
After dinner had been put away, Master Yao beckons with a finger, summoning the both of you to sit in front of him. Clearing his throat, he begins.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We have received two important requests. I never turn down any request, but these are <i>important </i>even by my demanding standards. The first is a request from an old acquaintance of mine in the Beggars&#x2019; Sect. One of their brethren is awaiting trial for murder in Kaifeng, and they claim he has been falsely accused. My acquaintance asks for my assistance in obtaining a second opinion regarding the state of the corpse so that they may clear the beggar&#x2019;s name. The second request comes from the Songfeng Sword School, south of here near Tuzhonglin. The head of the school has suddenly fallen ill and is in critical condition. If I do not save him, he will die. They are aware of my price and are prepared to pay it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Your master smiles thinly. &#x201C;As you can see, I cannot be in two places at once. Cao&#x2019;er, you will take my place for one of these requests. I think it is time for you to become more independent. You are definitely up to the task of handling any of these requests.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The girl shrinks back, pulling her head into the mass of rags that she calls her clothes. &#x201C;...but&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll send Xu Jing with you,&#x201D; replies Yao with a nasty grin, cutting off any thoughts you might have had about having a few days off from dealing with the two of them. You do not hate them, but they do aggravate you at times, even with your new and improved patience. Cao&apos;er, on her part, seems visibly relieved, the tension draining from her posture.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very well, master,&#x201D; you answer tentatively, &#x201C;but a question, if I may. Which request would <i>you </i>prefer to handle?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A wise question,&#x201D; snorts Yao, though you do not know if he is being sarcastic. &#x201C;I would rather handle the Songfeng case. I have little interest in looking at those that are already dead. What do <i>you </i>think, clever apprentice of mine?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You would prefer to take the Beggars&#x2019; Sect request. Despite her shyness Cao&#x2019;er is <i>rather </i>good at investigating corpses, as you have seen firsthand for yourself a number of times, and this should be something she can handle easily. Furthermore, the Beggars&#x2019; Sect are a major sect with an unparalleled information network, and making friends with them would be extremely useful to you - the beggars are noted for their loyalty to their allies.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You would prefer to go to Songfeng Sword School. It may not be a big sect, but it is rather reputable in the orthodox world and known to be honourable. More importantly, Master Yao will follow through with his &#x2018;save one, kill one&#x2019; principle in this case. Cao&#x2019;er is not bound by those principles, and if she saves the head of the school you could be walking away with money or techniques instead of taking another person&#x2019;s life.

					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Songfeng Sword School</span></b><br>
<br>
Master Yao accepts your request to go to Songfeng with a shrug and a slight chuckle. &#x201C;If you wish. I believe Cao&#x2019;er will be up to the task of curing the man. I will go to Kaifeng. At the very least, going there means I&#x2019;ll get to share a drink with Liuwu again. The man knows his wine for being such a dirty beggar.&#x201D; Stroking his beard, he remarks approvingly, &#x201C;That makes up for the tedious task of examining the corpse.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
At dawn, just as you are preparing to set off he gives you a dagger, which you strap to the inside of your boot. Leaning closely to you, the old man whispers, &#x201C;Should anything happen, <i>do not </i>allow Cao&#x2019;er to kill. She can never kill. If you have to, kill in her stead.&#x201D; You understand what he means. Cao&#x2019;er turns&#x2026; different, when she hurts a living thing, accidentally or otherwise. &#x201C;Do you expect trouble at Songfeng, master?&#x201D; you ask quietly.<br>
<br>
Yao snorts and slaps you on the back hard. &#x201C;I expect trouble everywhere. Now off with you!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The journey to takes you the better part of the day - by the time you finally reach your destination, the sun is setting. Despite her small stature, Cao&#x2019;er has borne the trek without a single noise of complaint.<br>
<br>
As you walked, you had asked around Tuzhonglin about the school that you are heading to, finding out a bit of its background. Rong Muben is the master and founder of the school. He had once been a senior disciple on Huashan, reputed for his light swordsmanship. After creating a reputation for himself, he had married and settled down in the forest near Tuzhonglin twenty years ago. There, he had built his Songfeng Sword School. The school is relatively reputable but not large - there are at most thirty or forty students. Apparently Rong Muben has combined his honour with an utter lack of ambition, lacking the will to expand his school. He has not challenged any other schools in ten years, preferring to spend his time cultivating himself in meditation. Times have been hard recently, and the son has just returned a few months ago from a year&#x2019;s stay at Huashan Sect, where his father had trained.<br>
<br>
The two disciples at the gate to the compound stare at you with an unfriendly eye.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Report your name!&#x201D; challenges one of the disciples.<br>
<br>
You make a courteous bow and introduce yourself and Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;We are apprentices of the Master Physician Yao Shunshi. I believe we are expected?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The two look at each other, whispering.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, we didn&#x2019;t-&#x201D; begins one of the disciples, before a woman&#x2019;s voice is heard from the courtyard, its owner approaching the gate swiftly. &#x201C;Are the physician&#x2019;s apprentices there?&#x201D; A matronly woman of about forty steps out of the gate, respectably dressed. She looks flustered and worried, deep lines having etched into her brow, but finds it in herself to give you a gentle, welcoming smile.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, the two of you must be Master Yao&#x2019;s apprentices! I am Madam Rong, the wife of our house&#x2019;s master, Songfeng School Master Rong Muben. Master Yao sent a message saying that he was busy and he would send two representatives in his stead. He did not mention that they were children, however&#x2026; no matter! Master Yao&#x2019;s reputation is unimpeachable! Even his apprentice will be better than any doctor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She looks at you with hope, showing such faith in you that you can&#x2019;t help but feel embarrassed. &#x201C;Oh, no, I&#x2019;m not the one who will be doing the healing. My senior here is the real expert. I&#x2019;m Xu Jing, and she&#x2019;s Cao&#x2019;er,&#x201D; you say humbly. Cao&#x2019;er gives a yelp of panic as you direct the attention over to her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Such a cute young girl is your senior? That is impressive, Cao&#x2019;er! I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll do just fine,&#x201D; says the woman enthusiastically, patting the girl&#x2019;s head bravely - it takes some courage to touch that mess of hair. You can tell that Madam Rong is trying to stay calm and put Cao&#x2019;er at ease despite her own worries. The motherly instincts of a grown woman, perhaps? &#x201C;Please, please do come in.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As she leads the both of you into the courtyard, her footsteps quicken. You gesture at Cao&#x2019;er to hurry up. The school&#x2019;s master may be in very poor condition.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Rong Muben&#x2019;s face is pale, his eyes dark and his cheeks sunken. Cao&#x2019;er swiftly goes by his side and takes his pulse. After a while, she looks up at you and begins to recite the materials that she will need. In such situations, she does not hesitate to speak, though her voice is still as hoarse as ever. &#x201C;Five <i>ke </i>of caomu, two and a half <i>ke</i> of zhongliang&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You hurriedly open up your bags and open up the packed herbs. After measuring the proper amount, you place the herbal mixture in a wooden bowl, passing it to Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;Madam Rong, could you please show my senior to the kitchen?&#x201D; She obliges quickly, placing two hands on Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s shoulders and steering her out of the room. In the meantime, you go over to the sickly Master Rong.<br>
<br>
You recognize the mixture that Cao&#x2019;er had asked for - Master Rong has been poisoned. Looking at the dazed patient more closely, you can see the tell-tale signs of dark spots under his jaw.  As you are about to try and speak to him, you hear a quiet cough from the doorway. Turning your head, you see a young man of perhaps twenty in the robes of a Songfeng disciple, except slightly more ornate in its embroidery.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are you doing with my father?&#x201D; he asks. You give him a polite bow, making sure not to establish eye contact. You can smell his arrogance even from a distance - it&#x2019;s not the first time you&#x2019;ve met such a man. You know his sort; he is the type of man who would have been a bully as a boy. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m an apprentice sent by Master Yao. We are here to heal him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; he frowns. &#x201C;Better do a good job, then. Mother has been fervently praying for Father to be healed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How long has he been sickly?&#x201D; you ask politely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Does that matter?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It does. The longer a sickness breeds, the harder it is to banish,&#x201D; you speak, taking on the cultured tones of medicinal tomes that you have read. It is comfortable, as if slipping back into the palace lingo that you once used.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps a week, then. Father fell off a horse and has never been the same since,&#x201D; replies the young man absent-mindedly, his brow creasing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see. That is important information. Thank you&#x2026; young master?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Rong Zhiyu, heir of the Songfeng Sword School. It has been a pleasure to make your acquaintance, apprentice physician. Now, if you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I have matters of the school to see to so that things will be running smoothly when Father recovers.&#x201D; Placing his hands together, he bows and departs.<br>
<br>
Soon after, Cao&#x2019;er returns with Madam Rong. The potion is ready - it stinks, as it always does. Madam Rong gently cradles her husband&#x2019;s head and raises it, while Cao&#x2019;er pours the nasty concoction down his throat. Then, she stabs at his pressure points with her finger, swiftly and precisely, without hesitation. Within minutes, the colour returns to Master Rong&#x2019;s face. His eyes slip closed and a gentle snore begins to emit from his lips.<br>
<br>
The three of you exit the room quietly, allowing the man to rest. Madam Rong gives Cao&#x2019;er a tight hug - truly, she is a brave woman not afraid of filth. &#x201C;Thank you! You are truly the followers of the wondrous physician.&#x201D; She smiles tearfully. &#x201C;I&#x2026; I expect that I will have to pay the price now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;...not cured yet. I&#x2019;m not as good as my Master,&#x201D; croaks Cao&#x2019;er in response. &#x201C;I need one more session with him tomorrow to remove the p&#x2026; illness&#x2026;&#x201D; It looks like she&#x2019;s a bit more tactful than her master in this regard. Cao&#x2019;er then shakes her head, continuing, &#x201C;Also, no killing either. We&#x2019;ll be paid normally...&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You haven&#x2019;t said anything about the price for saving a life on the way here, thinking that you would raise it when the treatment is complete - she&#x2019;s decided on this herself.<br>
<br>
The look on Madam Rong&#x2019;s face is one of utter surprise and joy, as if Buddha himself had come down to bless her. She embraces Cao&#x2019;er in a hug so tight that you can hear her breath squeaking out. &#x201C;Thank you! Thank you! I won&#x2019;t forget this. You can be sure that I will let everyone know that Master Yao has some very fine apprentices to follow in his footsteps. The both of you will always be welcome here at Songfeng!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The grateful Madam Rong escorts you personally to your room. Cao&#x2019;er had refused to sleep in a separate one, and with the clucking of a disapproving mother hen Madam Rong had grudgingly allowed it. <i>Very </i>grudgingly, as she continues knocking on the door every ten minutes to find out if you need anything. You spot her shadow hovering through the paper walls, listening in. It seems that she&#x2019;s guarding Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s chastity as fervently as she would her own daughter&#x2019;s.<br>
<br>
After sometime Madam Rong stops poking her head in, seemingly called away for other things. You heave a sigh of relief. Once the two of you are truly alone, you can&#x2019;t resist patting her on the head; she&#x2019;s just like a cute little animal. &#x201C;Good job. I&#x2019;m really proud of you.&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er blushes and smiles shyly, staring at the floor again. She <i>has </i>done well - if everything goes smoothly, tomorrow you will leave with a proper reward, without taking Madam Rong&#x2019;s life. <i>If</i>.<br>
<br>
This is a clear case of poisoning, and you already have your suspect. Madam Rong seems oblivious, and Cao&#x2019;er was tactful enough to refrain from mentioning the poison - she is leaving the decision to you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How do the others not see it,&#x201D; you mutter. Then again, a mother will always think the world of her son, and he may have gained the support of the rest of the disciples.<br>
<br>
There is yet another knock at the door, and a voice speaks. It is not Madam Rong this time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is Rong Zhiyu. May I come in, apprentices?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You know he will come in whether you allow it or not. &#x201C;Please do, Young Master Rong,&#x201D; you call out.<br>
<br>
Rong Zhiyu walks in, grinning thinly. Falsely. In his left hand he is carrying a sword, in the other, a book. Another sword is tucked in at his waist. You tense up, shifting your body instinctively so that Cao&#x2019;er is behind you. Even so, you force your face into a smile. It is probably more natural than his on account of your constant practice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just here to tell you the good news. Father is fully recovered now, and won&#x2019;t be needing your assistance tomorrow.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There is no need to even think about it - he is lying. Cao&#x2019;er will not be wrong about the amount of treatment required.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am unsure what reward you would want - Mother said that you did not demand the Killing Physician&#x2019;s fee, and I am grateful for that. Unfortunately, as you know we are not a very rich school. I thought of giving these to you,&#x201D; says Rong Zhiyu, as he tosses the sword and book at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That sword has been passed down through the ages in the Rong family, and the book instructs you in the Songfeng Swordplay. These are our prized heirlooms.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look at the sword, drawing it partially from the scabbard. The design is old - perhaps more than a hundred years old - and when you wield it there is something off about its balance, though you cannot tell what exactly. You have had experience with swords in the palace, and this sword just feels wrong in your hand. Perhaps it is just badly made.<br>
<br>
Then, you look at the book. There is only one page within - the first step of the Songfeng Swordplay.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The rest of the steps are school secrets - if you want them, you will have to join and pay a fee,&#x201D; smiles the young master. The &apos;gifts&apos; are clearly meant as insults. You can feel Cao&#x2019;er grabbing your sleeve.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;These are marvellous treasures, Young Master Rong. Are you sure we can have them?&#x201D; you say, chuckling with feigned pleasure.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course. They are really more than you deserve, but I would say it is fitting payment for curing my dear father.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you, Young Master Rong,&#x201D; you bow politely. &#x201C;That must not be the only reason you are here, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His eyes narrow. &#x201C;Since your business here is done, perhaps you can be on your way, apprentices.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would, but the road is dark at night, Young Master. Where would you have us go? We have walked a long way today,&#x201D; you reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have arranged for an inn&#x2019;s room at Tuzhonglin, just ten minutes away. I will have four of our school&#x2019;s disciples escort you there,&#x201D; he says, staring at you. It looks like his mind is set and he will not be swayed. You are not wanted here.<br>
<br>
You are also not new to the <i>jianghu </i>any more. Grinning at Rong Zhiyu, you know that there is a chance that those disciples will attempt to cut you and Cao&#x2019;er down in the dark, once you&#x2019;re safely away from the school. Of course, in the woods you could always try to lose them, but if you walk away now, you are certain that Master Rong will die. You would be betraying Madam Rong&#x2019;s trust, and your master&#x2019;s own reputation.<br>
<br>
On the other hand&#x2026; Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s grip on your sleeve tightens, as she is starting to get nervous at the situation.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You agree to leave with the old sword and the single-page book as payment. If they attempt to attack you, you will try to slip away. If necessary you will kill them. You cannot let Cao&#x2019;er get wrapped up in this. It is unfortunate for Master and Madam Rong, but you cannot help them, not against the viper in their own blanket.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You agree to leave, but once you are in the woods you will attempt to give the disciples the slip. You will put Cao&#x2019;er some place safe and ask her to show you how to heal Master Rong. Picking up what you can, you will then sneak back into the school alone - bringing Cao&#x2019;er along will be too difficult for your skills - and attempt to cure him yourself.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You refuse Rong Zhiyu to his face. He is a bully of the worst sort - he would never have tried this with Master Yao. He can do his best if he dares, but you bet that he will be too cowardly to face you in a fight. Even though he is five years older than you and trained properly in the sword, a swordsman is nothing if you can prevent him from drawing his blade. <i>You have your legs</i>.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You offer to help him. What is wrong with poisoning? You will ask Cao&apos;er to hold back and only pretend to heal, while you give more poison to Rong Muben yourself. Rong Zhiyu may be dislikeable, but his father won&apos;t live forever anyway and it&apos;ll be good to have him as an ally by helping him now.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You pretend to offer to help him. You tell him Cao&apos;er can use more lethal poisons to ensure that his father dies. Of course, that will be a trick, and Cao&apos;er will be doing her best to heal him instead. Hopefully he will fall for this proposal. You will try to expose him afterwards; there is no point healing him and not dealing with the son if he&apos;s just going to try the same thing again after you leave.

            <h3>五 · Turmoil in Songfeng</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Turmoil in Songfeng</span></b><br>
<br>
You rack your mind for a while, thinking of the best way to reject him, and decide that you should at least be talking like you are addressing a senior eunuch even if you are telling him no. After all, you are the same person who, at the age of seven, had once pissed in the rice bowl of Grand Eunuch Li upon your prince&#x2019;s suggestion; you will not back down from this bully. You will stand your ground. With etiquette.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am really afraid I cannot do that, Young Master Rong,&#x201D; you answer directly, taking such a polite tone that you feel like punching yourself in the head. &#x201C;My senior is exhausted and requires immediate rest. I am sure the hospitability of your school rivals that of any inn, young master; I hope you will not begrudge us partaking of it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Rong Zhiyu does not move, nor does he say a word. He doesn&#x2019;t know how to answer you. A perfect gentleman with nothing to hide would acquiesce to such flattery, and that is how he wanted to present himself. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; he finally says unconvincingly. &#x201C;I must insist.&#x201D; Not the smartest man around.<br>
<br>
You already have an answer ready. &#x201C;I have no say in the matter if you insist, young master. However, I do insist that my senior and I be allowed to bid your respected mother goodbye before we go, to thank her for her hospitability. We will need to inform her that we will be coming back the next morning for the follow-up session. Although your father is already recovering, we do need to perform a check-up to ensure he will enjoy fullness of health. I am sure you have no objections to that, young master? I&#x2019;m sure no one can accuse you of being an unfilial son.&#x201D; Perhaps you shouldn&#x2019;t have said that last sentence, but then again, it was too hard to resist such a good-natured, innocuous line.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are really something, aren&#x2019;t you...&#x201D; The young Rong grimaces angrily, staring at you. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see how long you can keep flapping that glib tongue of yours! I will not let you mock me!&#x201D; His hand reaches towards the sword at his side - whether to threaten or to attack you, you don&#x2019;t know, but you will not let him draw that sword.<br>
<br>
Rong Zhiyu may have more skill and experience under his belt, but you are <i>faster</i>.<br>
<br>
Whipping your foot up, you kick his hand away before he can close his fingers around the sword&#x2019;s hilt.<br>
<br>
His eyes widen in surprise as he takes a step back, cradling his sore hand. You take a step forward, covering Cao&#x2019;er entirely with your own body. Rong looks at you with suspicion and fear, realizing that you are not a simple apprentice who knows only herbs and medicines.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Young Master Rong,&#x201D; you begin with a genial smile, &#x201C;I am sure this is all a misunderstanding-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;THIEVES!&#x201D; shouts Rong without warning, as he turns and bolts through the door. &#x201C;Help! Thieves! The apprentices are thieves!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You chase out after the screaming young master and realize too late that the old sword he had given you is still in your hand. At least a dozen Songfeng disciples are heading towards you down the corridor, with Rong Zhiyu awaiting them. You don&#x2019;t know if they were summoned by his shouts, or if they had been waiting there all this while, but it doesn&#x2019;t change the fact that you are trapped.  He points an accusing finger at you. &#x201C;This boy attempted to steal a sword from us!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The disciples glare at you menacingly, some of them drawing their own swords. Should you fight? Should you flee? You doubt you can talk them down.<br>
<br>
Before you can decide, a loud voice interrupts the din. &#x201C;What is going on here?&#x201D; Madam Rong pushes her way past the disciples, looking around her in bewilderment. She turns to her son and asks, &#x201C;Zhiyu, what is going on?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Mother,&#x201D; beseeches Rong, &#x201C;we must dismiss these burgling misfits! I warned you that the apprentices were bound to steal from us, and they have. That boy there went and stole the old family sword!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Madam Rong spins around quickly, staring at you. There is a severe look of disappointment in her eyes as she catches sight of the sword. &#x201C;Oh, Xu Jing, you should not have done that!&#x201D; she exclaims loudly. &#x201C;My husband would have given it to you if you asked for it tomorrow. It&#x2019;s just an old sword after all. This is most unseemly! I knew the Killer Physician and his apprentices were the sort to do as they wish, but this...&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It looks like despite her friendly nature and the services Cao&#x2019;er has rendered, the eccentric reputation of Master Yao - helped along by you - is not a wall that can be surmounted all that easily. You resist the urge to scream your innocence, or to shout anything sarcastic that they could misinterpret. Taking a deep breath, you calm yourself. Protesting your innocence or suddenly accusing Rong Zhiyu of poisoning will only make you look worse at this point. Expecting anyone in this school to believe your word over that of their young master, without any shred of evidence, when you are in a pinch yourself and could be expected to lie to save your own skin - that is an exercise in futility.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am very sorry, Madam Rong, Young Master!&#x201D; You take the very best apologetic behaviour that you have learnt from your years in the palace, and bend your body in a deep bow, offering the sword back obsequiously with outstretched arms as if they were the Dickless Five themselves.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have always been interested in swords from when I was a child!&#x201D; That is the truth.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This sword felt interesting in my hand,&#x201D; That is also the truth.<br>
<br>
&#x201C; I am not sure how the sword came to be in my room in the first place, but I couldn&#x2019;t resist taking a closer look at it,&#x201D; you begin to lie. &#x201C;Unfortunately the young master must have misunderstood the situation when he entered the room without knocking.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s&#x2026; right,&#x201D; muses Madam Rong. &#x201C;I could have sworn you did not leave the room with Cao&#x2019;er&#x2026;&#x201D; She catches herself and makes an embarrassed cough. &#x201C;I mean, I thought the sword was in the armory. Did we misplace it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He&#x2026; he must have snuck out and taken it!&#x201D; protests Rong Zhiyu angrily. &#x201C;You are a common thief and it was a mistake ever letting the two of you step into this house!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am truly very sorry for offending with my actions, young master, but my actions are my own. Do not lump Cao&#x2019;er in together with me. My senior is in every way better as a person, a rare flower blooming on a heap of dung. She would never condone what I did - she came only to heal your esteemed father.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You take a surreptitious glance at Madam Rong as you remind her of what Cao&#x2019;er has done for the school&#x2019;s master. Your heart is pounding very quickly - you are throwing out words as you think of them, hoping to find a way out of this little pickle and praying not to make a misstep. You had underestimated Rong Zhiyu&#x2019;s cunning. Well, not by much, but still&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Mother, do not listen to this sneak,&#x201D; snarls Rong desperately.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, dear son, perhaps we overreacted a little?&#x201D; says Madam Rong finally. You feel the joy of relief rushing through your body. Rong Zhiyu would not cut me to pieces without reason in front of his mother. If he was that sort of man, he would have cut his father&#x2019;s throat while the old man was still weak from poison; you do doubt the son can best the father in a straight fight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Please, young master, you may retrieve the sword. I meant no offense by it,&#x201D; you say, continuing to keep your body bent. You could keep this up all night. Your best record for such a position was issued by the Emperor via Grand Eunuch Li&#x2019;s counsel after the rice bowl incident - ten hours. Your back hurt for days afterwards.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think we should let the boy look at the sword more if he wants to, shouldn&#x2019;t we? Zhiyu?&#x201D; asks Madam Rong as she turns to her son. &#x201C;He does like swords, like you do. I think he will respect the sword and its current owners enough not to run off with it, even if he was not educated as well as you are.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The young master just stares at me with undisguised hate. Things aren&#x2019;t going the way he planned at all, but to be fair, things aren&#x2019;t going the way you planned either. You straighten yourself without waiting for him to respond. With a somber face, you say, &#x201C;Again, I must apologize for causing the disturbance tonight, madam and young master. I hope you can find it in yourselves to forgive me. You must not blame Young Master Rong for his misunderstanding, madam. I can see he is someone who will zealously fight for the school&#x2019;s honour, and a man of upstanding character.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, my son is a good man,&#x201D; smiles Madam Rong. &#x201C;Being our only child we put everything we had into raising him as a gentleman, and I am happy to say that he has surpassed all of our expectations. He may be a bit&#x2026; over-enthusiastic at times, and trusting in nature, but he always does the right thing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Behind her, the son in question glowers at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can see that he is exactly as you describe him,&#x201D; you say. You had just one more thing to say. &#x201C;Ah, Madam Rong, my senior had bid me say something about your husband&#x2019;s condition.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She becomes nervous. &#x201C;What is it? Is there something wrong?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, oh no. Not at all. She just said that until the dawn comes, your husband would do better with his spouse&#x2019;s touch. The medicine she made promotes an energetic circulation of yang qi. She says it will aid his recovery in both his flow of qi and&#x2026; ah, other matters if you stay by his side tonight.&#x201D; You say the last line with a tone just suggestive enough that a mature woman would understand its meaning, though you take care to keep your manner remote.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, oh my,&#x201D; says Madam Rong, turning slightly flushed. &#x201C;That&#x2026; would be nice. Cao&#x2019;er is a very knowledgeable girl for her age, isn&#x2019;t she? Thank you.&#x201D; Rong Zhiyu gives a slight choke of disbelief, a scandalized look creeping over his face at what you have just implied. He stomps off in a huff, the disciples following in his wake while casting suspicious glances over their shoulder at you. Madam Rong, on the other hand, gives you a quick nod of the head before walking off towards her husband&#x2019;s room.<br>
<br>
You heave a sigh of relief. That was a close call. Had you been a bit slower with your words for any reason, Madam Rong would likely have ordered you to be locked up. Then, no doubt you would suffer a mysterious accident while in the cell. You don&#x2019;t even want to think about what might happen to Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
When you head back into your room, you find that she&#x2019;s fallen asleep, grinding her teeth loudly and sprawled wide on the bed. You roll her onto her side, making room for yourself, and sit down as you rub your eyes. The one-page manual that Rong Zhiyu had tossed at you is still here. You open it, studying the instructions for that one step. You won&apos;t be able to execute it overnight, but you have nothing to do anyway. It&#x2019;s going to be a long night.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You are pleasantly surprised when you awake the next morning without finding your throat opened up by an angry heir of a sword school. However, there is a heavy weight pressing down on your legs, and they have turned uncomfortably numb. Sometime during the night, Cao&#x2019;er had crawled into your lap. You shake her awake and begin preparing yourself. It&#x2019;s time to wrap things up at Songfeng.<br>
<br>
When you arrive at Rong Muben&#x2019;s room with Cao&#x2019;er in tow, he still looks frail but in much better condition than when you saw him last. Madam Rong is still with him, her face shiny and her hair slightly disheveled from exertions that you will not mention on this fine autumn morning. Rong Zhiyu is already there, looking uncomfortable. When he sees you, however, he smiles gracefully and bows. His eyes, however, are full of venom. You have made an enemy here.<br>
<br>
Madam Rong introduces the two of you to the conscious master, who bows his head politely and thanks you for your help. &#x201C;I am in your debt, Xu Jing and Cao&#x2019;er,&#x201D; smiles Master Rong. &#x201C;I did not think I would survive this sickness.&#x201D; You take note of those words. Most masters are able to know if they have been poisoned - that he did not realize it means that the poison was of a very insidious nature. You are definitely not the first physicians to have paid a visit; the others must have failed to diagnose the poison that was killing the master.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er gives you a quick tug of the sleeve, noticing you lost in thought. &#x201C;...will tell you the details of the illness when we do our studies later, Jing,&#x201D; she whispers. You nod.<br>
<br>
The second session is almost similar to the first, though you glimpse Cao&#x2019;er hitting different points this time around. When it is done, Master Rong exhales. &#x201C;This is wondrous. I feel like a new man, better than I was before the illness. You must be as good as your master, little girl.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;...no&#x2026; not yet,&#x201D; she replies shyly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not sure how I can repay you,&#x201D; says Rong Muben. &#x201C;My son says that you have been particularly taken with an old family sword of ours. It is yours if you wish it. I understand that the common price for the Killer Physician is the life of another, and I am very grateful that it has not been requested. We do not have a lot of taels at the moment, but we will give what we can spare. I may also find some other way to repay you for your kindness, perhaps a letter of recommendation for your conduct.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You glance at Rong Zhiyu. You know that he will not give up this easily and that he will make another attempt on his trusting father in the future. However, you are also certain that Rong Muben, oblivious to the danger, will not listen to your warnings. After all, you have not managed to find any evidence at all. If you bring it up, a man like him will only consider it an insult to him and his family. You could collect your payment and walk away. That means that should Rong Zhiyu become head of the school, you will have made an enemy of Songfeng.<br>
<br>
According to the Stratagems, to ensure your foe is defeated, you must be thorough. When the grass is cut the roots must be eradicated. Leaving Rong Zhiyu alive and in position to carry out his plans may come back to haunt you in the future regardless of how powerless he may seem right now - you have certainly earned his ire. How, then, can you eradicate him?<br>
<br>
There is a path ready for you to take - a path where you prey on Rong Muben&apos;s honour to protect him. The Killer Physician&#x2019;s price. Though Cao&apos;er had declined it, you know she will follow your lead in this matter, deferring to your judgment of the situation. You will claim it, and you will claim Rong Zhiyu&#x2019;s life in a fair duel so that there can be no complaints. Rong Muben, being the honourable man that he is, will be forced to accede to your request. He will not seek revenge for this price, though you will not be favoured by the Songfeng school either. Who can be, after killing their young master and heir?<br>
<br>
If you do not, you would be leaving Master and Madam Rong to the whims of their son, and possibly their deaths. Is that how you should conclude this case? You feel that it leaves things unfinished, that you have only helped them insofar as it is <i>convenient</i> for you to do so, that you have no need to worry about anything besides the scope of your job and the magnitude of your rewards. But perhaps it is the wiser choice to take.<br>
<br>
You choose to&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Accuse Rong Zhiyu in front of his father.<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> Do not accuse Rong Zhiyu in front of his father.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>Claim the Killer Physician&#x2019;s price, forfeiting all other rewards that you may get.<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> Walk away with the rewards that Rong Muben will offer.

            <h3>六 · The Physician&#039;s Price</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Physician&#x2019;s Price</span></b><br>
<br>
You decide to act. &#x201C;Master Rong, you were poisoned. It was not any normal illness.&#x201D; He stares at you gravely, his face solemn. &#x201C;Poison, you say? That is a surprise. Who would want me dead? I do not have any enemies in the <i>jianghu</i>. I, Rong Muben, have always conducted myself with honour. Could you be mistaken in your diagnosis?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You shake your head. Perhaps Cao&#x2019;er could explain it more convincingly, but you do not want to drag her into this matter. If she speaks up now she would become involved. This is not her burden to bear. &#x201C;It is not mistaken, Master Rong. I-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wuxian Canshui Poison, (&#x4E94;&#x4ED9;&#x6B98;&#x6C34;&#x6BD2; Five Immortals Crippling Water Poison)&#x201D; blurts out Cao&#x2019;er quickly as she interrupts you. You look at her in surprise as she tries to cobble together a proper sentence. &#x201C;... it&#x2019;s used by the Wudu&#x2026; the Five Poisons Cult. It&#x2019;s one of their five main poisons. I mean, they use it a lot&#x2026; the effect is, it&#x2019;s theirs&#x2026;&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er tries bravely but runs out of steam and words as she shrinks under the attention of the Rong family. You place a hand on her shoulder, holding it firmly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wuxian Canshui?&#x201D; laughs Rong Muben fearfully. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think I have crossed the Wudu Cult in any way in my entire life as a pugilist. And sadly I admit my school is too insignificant to attract their attention. This is&#x2026; well, this is a bit unbelievable.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His nervous dismissal is understandable. The Wudu Cult, the cult of the Five Poisons, are acknowledged as the masters of poisons in the pugilistic world. Based in Guizhou, their Tufan leader, Tulu Huodu, is powerful enough in conventional martial arts that he has gained recognition as the feared Western Snake.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My senior is never wrong in her diagnosis. More importantly, Master Rong, your son is responsible.&#x201D; There is no point sugar-coating your words, or beating around the bush; it would only be a waste of time. You throw out the accusation quickly. &#x201C;If not for the actual deed, then at least for the plan. I feel obligated to warn you of this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Madam Rong gasps, covering her mouth with her hands.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Yao&#x2019;s apprentice,&#x201D; says Rong Muben heavily, &#x201C;you may have saved my life, but that does not mean you can come into my house and spout nonsensical lies. My son told me that you might attempt to accuse him of some nefarious deed over the old sword you took. I did not think it would be so, but&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Rong-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Silence, boy. It is not gentlemanly for a person to accuse blindly without proof, even if he is a benefactor of mine. I would like you to depart from my school after receiving your reward.&#x201D; His attitude is suddenly cold and stern - he will not listen to you anymore. It looks like your words have really insulted him. You give him a rigid bow. He does not believe you and does not plan to even give your words due consideration. What did you expect to accomplish by telling him that? You knew it would turn out this way.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, yes, the reward, Master Rong,&#x201D; you say. Your voice is equally cold as you try to keep your feelings under control. There is no more place for unrestrained emotion here. You cannot do this out of anger or out of spite. You have been taught that once a path has been decided, straying from it for emotional reasons will only lead to disaster. Telling yourself that you are doing the right thing, you say the words.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Keep your rewards. I will claim the Killer Physician&#x2019;s price, as his apprentice,&#x201D; you declare loudly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2026; you said&#x2026;&#x201D; Madam Rong mumbles confusedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you going back on your word, boy? Why do you do this?&#x201D; Rong Muben asks, raising his voice. He is not pleased at all.<br>
<br>
Rong Zhiyu strides towards you with an angry look on his face, though his smiling eyes tell you that he feels happy inside. Vindicated, perhaps. &#x201C;Father, I told you they were not to be trusted! Allow me to arrest them-&#x201D; You interrupt him, raising a finger. &#x201C;The price must be paid, Young Master Rong. A life for a life. The world must be balanced. You will be the price for saving your father.&#x201D; Rong Zhiyu falls back, his face suddenly pale.<br>
<br>
The wail from Madam Rong pierces your eardrums. &#x201C;No! Take me! Take me instead!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you think I am going to help you kill my only son,&#x201D; growls Master Rong with his teeth clenched, &#x201C;you are sorely mistaken. There is no need to do this, Xu Jing. You promised to waive the price in return for rewards. Why go to these lengths?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Because I believe he is a danger to your life, Master Rong. The way of the physician is to heal, but we do not only limit ourselves to healing sickness of the flesh. Cao&#x2019;er has cured you of the poison in your body. I will cure you of the poison in your family.&#x201D; You keep your voice carefully frigid and your eyes intently on the silent Rong Zhiyu. It feels like you are putting on a stage act, speaking your words carefully and removing them from your real self. The truth that you are declaring on this morning seems even more remote to you than the lies that you spoke last night.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is no poison in my family, Xu Jing. I will not accede to this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You refuse to pay the price, then?&#x201D; Your voice drops, almost a whisper yet as sharp as a knife.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let me pay it!&#x201D; shouts Madam Rong tearfully. &#x201C;I was the one who called for you. If anyone has to pay with their life, it should be me! Isn&#x2019;t that the rule of your master?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is wrong, madam.&#x201D; You shake your head - you do not actually know the rule that Master Yao operates by, but if he operates by no rules, whatever you say is true anyway. &#x201C;If that is the case, any rich man could just buy a servant to die in his place. That does not serve the balance. Those who save have the right to choose the one that will die. I will ask again. Master Rong, do you refuse to pay this price?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; no, but why do you make this so hard? Anything but my son! I would rather die than send him to the grave!&#x201D; shouts Rong Muben desperately.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do not ask for you to send him into the grave, Master Rong,&#x201D; you reply. &#x201C;I ask that you permit me a duel to the death with him. That is a fair way to pay the price, I would think.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My son is a fair swordsman,&#x201D; mutters the master of Songfeng, his distress fading. He seems confident that his son will defeat me. &#x201C;Can you even handle a sword? You look too young to fight him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That does not matter. This is the price I name.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And it&#x2019;s a price I accept!&#x201D; says Rong Zhiyu fiercely, confident now that you&apos;ve requested for a duel. &#x201C;This scoundrel has dishonoured my good name. I will not let him speak his lies anymore!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very well,&#x201D; sighs Master Rong. If his son has accepted, it seems that he will accede to this request. &#x201C;I wish it would not come to this, but if it must be so&#x2026; Xu Jing, you are a brave boy and I must admire that, but you should have learnt that falsehood is not something that should be spread wildly. I will send my apologies to Master Yao for your passing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We will fight in the training yard, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Rong Zhiyu as he gives you a nasty smile. He steps out of the room to head to the place of the match. Before you do the same, you look at Cao&#x2019;er. Without a word, she nods - she will take care of herself.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The training yard is covered with loose gravel, freshly raked over by the apprentices. Rong Zhiyu has already drawn his sword and is making a few practice swings with it as you arrive. Your audience will be his parents and the school&#x2019;s disciples. This is undoubtedly a more hostile crowd than the one you had during your horse-back match with Yunzi. You push at the gravel with your toes. The footing seems fine.<br>
<br>
Rong Zhiyu bows politely when he sees you, hands clasped together. &#x201C;Let this be a fair duel with swords. The heavens will smile upon the righteous,&#x201D; he calls out to the cheers of the disciples.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are an unfilial son and a poisoner, Rong Zhiyu,&#x201D; I say just as loudly. &#x201C;Heaven only sees fit to mock you with its smile.&#x201D; Many of the disciples fall silent upon hearing your accusation - this will not do your reputation any good, but it is beyond salvage now anyway. You focus on the man ahead of you, blocking out everything else.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I told you I would cut your glib tongue off!&#x201D; snarls Rong Zhiyu as he starts the match impatiently without waiting for the signal. His weapon - a long, slender sword with a slightly flexible blade - points straight at your head. Your opponent&#x2019;s footing shifts in the gravel, his right leg sweeping in front of his body as he falls into a stance. He holds his sword out, his blade parallel to the ground. You recognize this as the first step of the Songfeng Swordplay (&#x677E;&#x98A8;&#x528D;&#x6CD5; Pine Breeze Swordplay) - the Bending Pine Branch. With an effortless lunge, he swings his sword in a graceful arc.<br>
<br>
You block it with the old sword in your possession, still sheathed in its scabbard. The sword behaves strangely when swung and for now it would be a liability until you got used to wielding it. In an instant, Rong has pulled his sword away, skilfully parlaying his initial attack into a series of slashes and jabs that flow seamlessly. This is the essence of the Songfeng school&#x2019;s technique - the wielder will strike gently but swiftly, akin to a breeze swaying the needle-like leaves of the pine tree.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, you can&#x2019;t block a blade with your bare legs, nor are you good enough to take on a naked sword with the moves you know. Forced on the defense, you throw your sheathed sword up into a block at every move he makes. His blade doesn&#x2019;t stop when it hits yours - it slides smoothly off the scabbard as Rong redirects it into another attack. It is only your quicker speed and the relatively slow movements of the technique that prevent you from being cut. Whenever you see an opening for an attack, Rong appears to instantly draw away, before launching another series of strikes by starting off with the lunge. These are probably breaks in the technique designed to lure an enemy into overextending and also to create space should the user require it; their purpose is rather obvious to you. Even so, you can find no real opportunity to attack.<br>
<br>
You won&#x2019;t hold out at this rate. Cursing, you kick up a spray of gravel, causing Rong to fall back elegantly. There is a smirk on his face - the bastard isn&#x2019;t even winded, while your body is already beginning to tire from keeping up with his moves. The energy you expend in defense is much greater than the amount he uses on the attack. There are snickers from the disciples. It looks like you&#x2019;ll have to change your tactics a little. Besides, there may be a flaw in his technique.<br>
<br>
You shift your feet around, feeling the texture and give of the gravel. As he lunges yet again, you block the first strike. Again he moves his sword; again, in the same direction. You twist your sheathed sword, heavy in your hands, and yet growing familiar; metal clangs against metal as again you block him - and again, he moves, in an increasingly predictable way.<br>
<br>
His breezy swordplay is nothing more than a string of moves chained together elegantly to respond to the way you block. The more predictable you are, the more predictable the Songfeng technique becomes. Of course, it took you the exchange of many moves to finally realize it, but it&#x2019;s not too late yet.<br>
<br>
You shift the grip on your sword, as if preparing to draw it. Rong hesitates for just a moment, and you take that chance. Moving in close, you jab your leg outwards, hitting him in the shin before he can react. As he grimaces in pain, you follow up with a sweep. Rong&#x2019;s eyes flash dangerously.<br>
<br>
Your sweep misses, as somehow your opponent sidesteps it. <i>Qinggong</i>. Probably something he picked up from Huashan. His footwork quickens as he adopts another stance unlike the gentle moves of the Songfeng Swordplay; he begins utilizing quick, wild swings. You evade the first two strikes but the third grazes your arm. You block his follow-up attack hurriedly. Softly, Rong&#x2019;s sword slips away from your guard and thrusts at your heart.<br>
<br>
You only manage to avoid that lethal move by throwing yourself backwards with full force, but you are off-balance now. The young master of the Songfeng school presses the attack, grinning eagerly. Mixing his slow Songfeng swordplay with the quick attacks of his other technique, he manages to get past your guard at last.<br>
<br>
His blade strikes home, nicking your sides and limbs. With every hit he scores, his smile grows wider and his attacks grow more frenzied and careless. His excitement seems to grow.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you,&#x201D; he whispers with an ugly grin. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll cut you up for not knowing your place. You thought you could challenge me?&#x201D; You parry his attack with a strong swing, affecting a puzzled expression on your face despite the pain. &#x201C;You seem to be rather excited. Have you killed before?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He just snarls wordlessly at you and presses the attack, faster than ever. Your ungainly defense holds - you are amazed that you have come this far without a proper technique, but surely you cannot win like this.<br>
<br>
Another narrow escape, as the blade slices a bloody line across your cheek. Every cut that he makes focuses your thoughts even more, sapping away the anger and desperation that you have. Every cut that he makes seems to incite him even more, as his moves turn nervous in anticipation of the point where he finally cuts you down. You imagine he is probably thinking ahead to the moment of his glorious victory in his mind.<br>
<br>
As he grows wilder, you grow calmer.<br>
<br>
After all, that is the state of mind they taught you to hold when you need to kill.<br>
<br>
You remember being instructed to memorize the points of least resistance where you can stab a man. You remember being forced to practice on bound prisoners. Again, and again, and again, until the flow of blood over your hands becomes natural and you could do it without hesitation. Well, you do not dwell on that much nowadays - it is an unneeded memory. The fear of killing has already been removed from your spirit.<br>
<br>
Rong steps back, suddenly wary. Though the arrogant look has not been wiped off his face, there is a hint of fear in his eyes. You just smile at him. From the way he acts, you can tell that he has not truly killed a man before, at least not with his own hands. If he succeeds here, you would be his first.<br>
<br>
That&#x2026; would be embarrassing.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> You attempt a high level Duancao technique, one you have read about but have not even begun training. You will throw your sword at him as a distraction, and then run right at him. Using your Yinglang Step you will dart out of his vision at the last minute, and then swiftly kick him in three spots in the abdomen - the points of <i>zhizheng</i>, <i>tianxi</i> and<i> taixi</i>. By hitting these three pressure points with the force of a kick, you should be able to kill him instantly.<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> Having studied the first step of the Songfeng Swordplay all throughout last night, and seeing it in action multiple times today, you think you can derive a counter for it now. You draw your sword and taunt him into another lunge. You are certain he doesn&#x2019;t have the skill or control to stop his lunge, and then you will strike with a move of your own - utilizing your strength and speed - designed to defeat that bending pine branch and take his life in one blow.<br>
<br>
<b>C.</b> You feign defeat and drop your sword. The simplest ploy is the most effective. When he gets close to claim your life you will just draw your hidden dagger and stab him in the neck and whichever other parts necessary.<br>

            <h3>七 · Falling Pine</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Falling Pine</span></b><br>
<br>
You draw the old sword, letting the scabbard drop to the floor.<br>
<br>
The weathered metal is dull in the morning light, with a single word carved into the blade: the character for &#x2018;fish&#x2019;. Rong Zhiyu&#x2019;s wary gaze turns into a dismissive smirk. &#x201C;Ah, <i>finally</i> you draw the sword I gave you. A child fancying himself a swordsman, that does not even have a sword of his own. Do you even know how to wield one properly, boy?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The sharp end goes into the enemy,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;How hard can it be?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The disciples laugh and jeer at you. &#x201C;Oh, be polite!&#x201D; Rong calls out to them, laughing. The thought of you pitting your sword skills against him seems to have eased his mind. &#x201C;He must have gone mad in desperation!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As you put your right foot forward and point the sword at him, the blade parallel to the ground, the mocking crowd is silenced.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you think you are doing?&#x201D; says Rong Zhiyu, anger flashing in his eyes &#x2013; yet another emotion added to the volatile mixture within him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What does it look like I&#x2019;m doing?&#x201D; you reply, posed in the stance of the Songfeng Swordplay.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Insulting my father and his technique, it seems,&#x201D; growls Rong. This time, you do not answer, keeping the sword pointed at his heart and your stance steady. All of the elements are in place.<br>
<br>
You have the old sword, a Rong family heirloom, though they do not place much importance on it nowadays.<br>
<br>
You are adopting the stance of the Rong family&#x2019;s signature technique, preparing to execute the first step of the Songfeng Swordplay.<br>
<br>
As the proud young master of a sword school that has made its name with that technique, as the heir and inheritor of the school, Rong Zhiyu can only make <i>one </i>possible decision. He would have to match you in the Songfeng Swordplay and defeat you in a head-on clash. There is no other conclusion he can come to.<br>
<br>
Should he use a Huashan technique in his attack now, his name would be tarred no matter what he says. The young master of the Songfeng Sword School resorting to another sect&#x2019;s techniques in order to beat a fifteen year old physician&#x2019;s apprentice who has only studied the first step of the Songfeng Swordplay? He cannot afford to do anything else in front of all the disciples of the school and his parents. It would shame him, his father, <i>and </i>the school completely and utterly even if he won.<br>
<br>
Surely, with his privileged position and years of training, he would know the technique&#x2019;s intricacies far better than you did. Surely he would be able to execute it faster, stronger, and more gracefully than you could. How could his Songfeng Swordplay be inferior to yours?<br>
<br>
No, for Rong Zhiyu there is only one answer that he can accept.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It looks like you&#x2019;ve decided to die in a humiliating manner,&#x201D; sneers Rong Zhiyu as he falls into the Songfeng stance confidently, his movements far more elegant and practiced than yours. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll show you the difference in our skills.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Your heart is pounding away underneath your calm exterior. He has taken the bait, just like you expected. Now all that is left is for you to execute your move perfectly. You shift your grip, testing the balance of the sword. It should do. You calm your heavy breathing, controlling and regulating it with the measures you learned through the Yinglang Step.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201D; Rong Zhiyu calls out mockingly. &#x201C;Not coming to attack with your imitation technique? Are your knees trembling now, when faced with a true master of the sword?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You twitch your hand, making the point of the sword weave and bob unsteadily as you return his mockery with a polite smile. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m waiting for you to show me how it&#x2019;s really done, <i>young master</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That tongue of yours, I will have it torn out today!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Rong shouts as he lunges, executing the first step of the Songfeng Swordplay perfectly.<br>
<br>
He is a better swordsman than you are, by sheer virtue of intensive training from a young age. He knows more moves, understands more techniques. However, despite your inexperience, if you focus all of your strength and understanding into <i>one </i>move, you can beat him there&#x2026; and only there.<br>
<br>
His sword swings in a graceful arc. Like the breeze rustling around a pine tree, it is malleable and gentle. Catching the breeze is not an easy task even for a master.<br>
<br>
If you cannot capture the breeze, you will just have to chop down the pine tree.<br>
<br>
Your feet kick off the ground as you rush into his strike, imitating his movements. You match him, despite starting later. Your arm is faster. Your sword flies to intercept his.<br>
<br>
Metal meets metal. As he tries to pull away into another move, your sword follows even faster, helped along by its strange balance. In a situation where a true Songfeng practitioner would be withdrawing cautiously to glide into a second move, you are pressing the attack towards the center.<br>
<br>
It is a fast, reckless charge.<br>
<br>
Rong Zhiyu attempts to snap back to a defensive position, knowing that he has overreached on the attack, but your blade is too swift and strong. His desperate, unsteady guard is knocked aside. His stance is broken. The pine tree has fallen. In its absence, the gentle breeze transforms into a strong gale, but the wind is now <i>yours</i>.<br>
<br>
Your blade arcs towards his head at a high speed.<br>
<br>
And then, the old sword falls apart, the blade snapping into two at the stress of your attack.<br>
<br>
It really <i>was </i>just a badly made sword after all. Your swing falls just short of its mark, notching Rong&#x2019;s nose with the broken end of the blade.<br>
<br>
His counter-swing, which had started slow and was never going to arrive in time to save him, bites into your collar, digging into bone. A bloom of pain washes up your neck and shoulder.<br>
<br>
A wide grin spreads across the lucky bastard&#x2019;s face, filled with relief. &#x201C;Even Heaven is on my side!&#x201D; he shouts loudly into your face.<br>
<br>
You, on the other hand, quietly thrust your sword-arm upwards and outwards. Even a broken blade can kill. And this is a movement you have practiced many, many times, until you could do it in your sleep.<br>
<br>
The sharp end does, indeed, go into the enemy. Travelling under his rib-cage and avoiding bone, it sinks deep into Rong Zhiyu&#x2019;s chest, finding its mark.<br>
<br>
This is why you are a killer, and he isn&#x2019;t.<br>
<br>
What idiot would think that he&#x2019;s won a duel to the death when his sword is merely lodged in his opponent&#x2019;s collarbone?<br>
<br>
The young master of the Songfeng Sword School falls to his knees, a confused expression on his face. As you stagger backwards, clutching your wound, the audience explodes into a cacophony of roars and screams and wails. You see Master and Madam Rong rushing to their sole son&#x2019;s side. The disciples run towards you, their swords drawn. You are too tired to even escape, but they stop just short of your reach, surrounding you in a cautious circle. A few of them back away a step or two when your gaze meets theirs. You hear the sound of feet shifting in the gravel as the ones behind you attempt to approach in what they think to be a stealthy manner.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop! That is not how Songfeng disciples should act!&#x201D; The disciples look at each other nervously and part ways as Master Rong comes to the fore, his face pale and his hands bloody. With a swing of his hand, he throws a glinting object at you. The broken sword clatters to the ground, stained with the blood of Rong Zhiyu&#x2019;s heart.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You go <i>now</i>, Xu Jing. Go, and take the sword that killed my son along with you. I never want to see you or the blade again,&#x201D; says Rong Muben, his voice tired. He seems to have aged ten years in an instant.<br>
<br>
You reach down and grasp the sword, wincing at the pain. Giving Rong Muben a deep, respectful bow, you turn and walk off as the disciples of the school make way for you silently.<br>
<br>
The walk to the gates of the compound feels long and arduous. The pain increases every time you move your feet forward. If you die here, you are sure Rong will not lift a finger to help you. You stumble and grab a nearby pillar, leaving your blood-stained prints on it. Your vision blurs.<br>
<br>
You hear hurried footsteps coming towards you from the front. A disciple ignoring the command of Rong Muben? You suppose your ill luck is not done tormenting you yet. But, no, the footsteps sound lighter.<br>
<br>
You stagger forward one more step, and collapse into Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s arms.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When the both of you arrive at the hut outside Xuchang, with you swaddled in bandages, you see Master Yao has already returned. He is sitting outside the hut, stoking a fire. Another man is with him, wearing rough and ragged sack-cloth clothing and a dirty red cap. He appears to be a decade or so younger than Master Yao, his face weathered and his whiskers gray.<br>
<br>
When Master Yao sees you approach, he raises his eyebrows. &#x201C;You are late. I was about to go down to Tuzhonglin to look for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You sigh as you drop on your haunches with a groan, Cao&#x2019;er quietly supporting you from behind. &#x201C;As you can see, Master, I am in no condition to walk quickly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hmph,&#x201D; he snorts, getting up and coming over to inspect your wounds. &#x201C;They have been treated well. Don&#x2019;t be a big baby, you should recover fully by tomorrow.&#x201D; He turns to Cao&#x2019;er, saying, &#x201C;Good job healing your useless junior.&#x201D; Yao goes back to his seat and looks at you impatiently. &#x201C;So? What happened there?&#x201D; You glance at the other man, who has a twinkle of amusement in his eyes. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a friend,&#x201D; snaps Yao. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the story?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod and begin recounting all that had happened at the Songfeng Sword School. Your master listens quietly, sombrely, and when you finish, his friend laughs loudly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He&#x2019;s every bit as resourceful as you made him out to be, Shunshi! And your senior apprentice will be scarier than you in the future if she can cure Wuxian Canshui at this age. She&#x2019;s <i>much </i>better than you boasted of!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao glares at him unhappily. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s still a useless kid. Coming back injured like that just proves it, and he nearly got his senior into trouble.&#x201D; You look at your master with an amused smile, irking him. Has he been praising the both of you behind your backs?<br>
<br>
The ragged man gives you a mischievous bow. &#x201C;That is a marvellous adventure, Xu Jing. I will retell your exploits to my friends. Of course, the gossip of beggars and rogues mean little to the stuck-up swordsmen hiding up in their mountains, but to those who wander the <i>jianghu </i>seeking adventures and wrongs to right&#x2026; or rights to wrong, they will know of your name.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You return his bow respectfully. &#x201C;I thank you, kind uncle. May I be correct in presuming that you are a member of the Beggars&#x2019; Sect? Could I know how to address you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You would be right. Qi Liuwu is my name. Call me beggar if you like,&#x201D; grins the man.<br>
<br>
You spring to your feet despite your wounds &#x2013; you are in the presence of beggar royalty here. The leader of the huge Beggars&#x2019; Sect and one of the most powerful martial artists in the world today&#x2026; &#x201C;I-it&#x2019;s an honour to meet you, Master Qi!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, sit down, and stop with the polite speech,&#x201D; complains Master Yao. &#x201C;You have not been half as polite with me since the first month of your apprenticeship. What&#x2019;s with the sudden manners?&#x201D; Qi laughs. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, listen to your master. No need to stand on ceremony with me, kiddo. We&#x2019;re all travellers of the road here, and all equals. Come, drink with us.&#x201D; He shakes a gourd of wine &#x2013; you see that Yao and Qi appear to have already dealt with two more gourds lying empty on the ground.<br>
<br>
You gratefully accept &#x2013; after the events at Songfeng, you need some relaxation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, Master Yao, Master Qi,&#x201D; you ask, &#x201C;how did Kaifeng turn out?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao frowns while Qi just smiles sadly. Your master is the first to speak. &#x201C;Qi&#x2019;s friend was not the murderer. That much I can say. The rest, well&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was just Xiong&#x2019;s bad luck that he happened to be at the scene of the crime. Who would believe a beggar?&#x201D; says Qi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about the evidence you delivered to the magistrate? You did find out that he could not have killed the victim, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, the magistrate gave some argument based on the Dialects about how the evidence was not admissible in court.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You frown. &#x201C;But the Dialects have nothing to-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course they have nothing to do with it, boy,&#x201D; snaps Yao. &#x201C;But even though it is a public trial, the audience is full of beggars and peasants. How would they know what the Dialects have to say? No scholar in Kaifeng would defend a beggar either. I delivered my coroner&#x2019;s verdict, and that is where my duties as to the request ends.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Before you ask your master why <i>he </i>did not intervene,&#x201D; interjects Qi, &#x201C;he would rather not, and I would rather he <i>not </i>do so. Direct intervention would have counted as saving a life. I would not have my friend kill for the sake of another friend, or break his principles in doing so. No, that would not be right. But it is how it is. A beggar has no friends or family to rely on except his fellow beggars and the kind acquaintances he meets on the road. We are grateful for what help we receive. No need to ask for more. But enough of this topic. Drink up!&#x201D; He tosses another gourd at you.<br>
<br>
As the night passes on, the drink flows and the laughter grows. Cao&#x2019;er falls asleep rather early, leaning against your shoulder. This is the most excitement she&#x2019;s probably encountered in the year since you joined them. She must be really exhausted.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, kiddo,&#x201D; calls out Qi suddenly. His face is red from the wine, and it seems that he is already drunk after imbibing half a dozen gourds. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s that sword you have there? That the one you &#x2013;hic&#x2013; killed that bastard with?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look at the broken sword that you have brought back. &#x201C;Yes, it is.&#x201D; You offer it to Qi, as he clearly wants to take a look. He ponders the sword with a furrowed look, and then swings it around casually so fast that you cannot catch his movements. When he finishes his swing, bits of old metal have dropped off from the sword. A beautiful short blade is left behind. The inscriptions are archaic, catching the flickering light from the fire. It predates even the Han dynasty&#x2026; perhaps even the dynasty of the First Emperor.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Yuchang Sword&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Qi. &#x201C;Thought to be &#x2013;hic&#x2013; lost for a hundred years. It&#x2019;s one of the Ten Great Swords of history. I suppose&#x2026; &#x2013;hic&#x2013; it&#x2019;s bad luck for you that it has come into your hands.&#x201D; Cradling the slender sword, he looks grimly at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Bad luck? Why is that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, m&#x2019;boy&#x2026; this here sword,&#x201D; he whispers theatrically, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s an Emei treasure. You know, the nuns? I think it was stolen from them ages ago. They are going to &#x2013;hic&#x2013; hunt you down if they find out that the blade has re-emerged from hiding.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Emei &#x2013; one of the major orthodox sects. They only accept female disciples in their ranks and are regarded as one of the great powers, strong enough to rival Shaolin and Wudang. You grow slightly nervous.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Scared? You ought to be, kiddo,&#x201D; groans Qi. &#x201C;Once they send their Castration Nuns after you, you <i>will </i>be sorry.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, what? Castration nuns?&#x201D; You try to clarify what you have just heard.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You heard me the first time! Castration! Nuns! Nuns that are trained to castrate!&#x201D; exclaims Qi.<br>
<br>
You glance over at Master Yao. &#x201C;Is that true?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He nods solemnly. At this point, you don&#x2019;t know whether they are making fun of you or not.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But&#x2026; but&#x2026; don&#x2019;t worry! &#x2013;hic&#x2013; I&#x2019;ll teach you how to protect yourself from them. Watch my hands carefully. Once you master this move, &#x2013;hic&#x2013; you will be unbeatable.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, no, not again,&#x201D; grumbles Master Yao. &#x201C;Liuwu, you better-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
Ignoring your master, the Eastern Beggar squares off into a stance and begins performing moves from a technique, calling out their names as he executes them. It appears to be a palm technique, strong and robust in its attacks. Qi is performing it so fast that you cannot catch his moves &#x2013; it almost appears as if his arms have multiplied in number. The fire is blown out by a stray swing of his palms. With a shout, he finishes performing the final move of the technique, striking out at the hut behind him. There is a loud crash as the wooden wall splinters inwards, a great hole forming in the hut even though Qi is still standing a good distance away from it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Bad habit of his,&#x201D; grumbles Yao, &#x201C;Every time he gets drunk, he tries to show off his Xianglong Palms (&#x964D;&#x9F8D;&#x5341;&#x516B;&#x638C;,Dragon Subduing Eighteen Palms). Looks like we were unlucky enough to get the full show this time. Usually he wouldn&apos;t be steady enough to complete even the first move.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, what did you think of it, kiddo?&#x201D; smiles the drunken beggar as he wobbles back to a sitting position. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not supposed to teach it to outsiders, but eh, screw the council of elders. I&#x2019;m the head, and what I say goes!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod your head slowly. The entire sequence of moves was too fast and powerful for you to perceive, but you think you managed to catch the very first move that he used &#x2013; the most basic strike of the Xianglong Palms. You believe that he called it &#x2018;The Arrogant Dragon Regrets&#x2019;.<br>
<br>
You replay it over and over in your mind, wondering if you are getting it right&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When you wake up the next day, Qi Liuwu is gone. Master Yao prods at you with his foot. &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t be staying here any longer, boy. That idiot trashed the hut. Time to move on. I feel like wandering, so do you have any particular destination in mind?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Xiangyang City. A vital fortress city overlooking the Han river, it is run by a military-minded prefect. Wudang Mountain is a few days&#x2019; travel from Xiangyang.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Luoyang City. One of the main capitals of the Tang dynasty, though Chang&#x2019;an serves as the current residence of the Emperor. The Shaolin Temple is located on Mount Song, close to Luoyang.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Xuzhou City. A major trade center in the Jiangnan region, it is also an agricultural center. The Luoying Manor, a learning house for martial artists who are interested in the pursuits of art, history and scholarly knowledge, is located near the city.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Also, the drunken tale of the Castration Nuns bothers you. Perhaps...<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You pawn off the Yuchang Sword.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You keep the Yuchang Sword.

<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Obtaining an Invite</span></b><br>
<br>
You make your way slowly towards Xuzhou &#x2013; due to the approaching winter, colds are becoming more frequent, meaning that you had more jobs to take. Your abilities are proving sufficient to handle most of the minor ailments you encountered en route to the city. This gave Master Yao more time to spend tutoring Cao&#x2019;er &#x2013; he seemed to be preparing her for some sort of test, though he refused to tell and you refused to press the matter. On your part, you began practicing your qinggong further as you traversed the wilderness, granting you an even lighter step.<br>
<br>
When you arrive in Xuzhou, the snow has reached the city before you. At this time last year, you were shivering in the Cold Dungeon. Now you spent it with Master Yao and Cao&#x2019;er in the warm and cosy Jingtu Inn, one of the cheaper establishments in the older districts of Xuzhou.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hmph,&#x201D; snorts Master Yao grumpily, &#x201C;give me a cold little hut anytime. This place disagrees with my bones.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not sure whether you continue being contrarian just for the sake of it, Master. We&#x2019;re paying a cheap price for these comforts. Be grateful. It&#x2019;s not like we could find any suitable lodgings outside Xuzhou anyway, unless you plan to live under a tree.&#x201D; You frown at him as you pop a piece of duck meat into your mouth. Cao&#x2019;er had finished her meal early and was poring through a set of books &#x2013; they appeared to be basic martial arts manuals this time, of the cheapest sort anyone could find on the junk market. You wonder what she is planning; she&#x2019;s being tight-lipped recently.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Cities are too crowded for my taste.&#x201D; Your master grimaces, picking at his food. &#x201C;Why are we here again?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Getting senile in your old age, master? You asked me to pick where to go,&#x201D; I say, laughing.<br>
<br>
A duck bone is flicked into my forehead before I can even react. It stings &#x2013; the old bastard used his inner strength for that flick. He cackles. &#x201C;Are you being <i>stupid</i>, my idiot disciple? I asked you <i>why </i>we came here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sorry, master,&#x201D; you bow your head. You never did explain why you picked Xuzhou to him &#x2013; the old man had just agreed without asking for a reason. &#x201C;I want to visit Luoying Manor. I have heard that it is a gathering place for many different martial artists. Perhaps there I can find out more about my strange qi and the Yuchang Sword.&#x201D; You&#x2019;ve made a rough wooden sheath for the sword and wrapped it up tightly, concealing it on your person. With the thick robes worn during winter, it goes entirely unnoticed.<br>
<br>
Yao ponders your statement for a while, stroking his beard. &#x201C;Some very strange people are rumoured to be amongst the bookworms that gather at Luoying, and it would not be out of the question that some of them may have an idea of what to do with you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
When Master Yao calls someone strange, you know that he means it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But,&#x201D; he continues, &#x201C;I have never been in there, so I would not know. After all, I have never been invited.&#x201D; Looking at my puzzled face, he laughs maliciously. &#x201C;Oh, my idiot disciple! Did you think you could just walk up to Luoying Manor and ask to be let in? Or even pay your way in? It is a rather exclusive club. They would turn down even the Emperor himself if he was not to their liking.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;This invitation&#x2026; how do you think I can get my hands on one?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How do <i>you </i>think?&#x201D; grins Master Yao. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not here to do your work for you. All I need in my life is to wander, to heal, and to kill. What you do in your spare time is none of my business.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
It does not take long before Master Yao&#x2019;s arrival in the city becomes widespread gossip. Business begins rolling in &#x2013; there is always a small ailment or another that needs healing amongst the wealthy tradesmen and merchants that populate Xuzhou. Xuzhou proves to be <i>rather </i>more generous than Xuchang. In your spare time, between bringing Cao&#x2019;er on walks around the city &#x2013; that girl would coop herself up in the room for a year if you let her - and assisting your master, you begin gathering information on Luoying Manor from the locals.<br>
<br>
Luoying Manor and its estate are located on the far bank of Yunlong Lake, at the base of Yunlong Mountain and opposite Xuzhou proper. There are boats that take travellers over to the manor. It is owned by a mysterious woman named Lady Ji, who is rumoured to be an ageless and beautiful immortal, having resided in the manor for over two hundred years. It seems that Lady Ji has never left the grounds, preferring to live in seclusion.<br>
<br>
Initially, you think that Master Yao appears to have been mistaken about the need for an invite; according to the innkeeper, many scholars travel there year-round. However, you find out from an old scholar in Xuzhou that there <i>is </i>an &#x2018;inner court&#x2019; that can only be accessed by known fellows of the manor. These fellows are selected via a mysterious trial during the winter solstice conference which can only be attended by obtaining an invitation. This is probably the &#x2018;real&#x2019; Luoying Manor.<br>
<br>
The nature of the trial is unknown even to those who have passed it. No one knows the criteria by which they select their fellows, but the selection process is done every four years, during the winter solstice conference, and four are chosen at each trial year. Attending the conference itself requires an invitation, and these are given out by Luoying Manor via different means. This year is a trial year &#x2013; if you do not participate it will be another four years before you have the chance.<br>
<br>
There are those who are already fellows of the manor &#x2013; these will receive their invitations without condition.<br>
<br>
There is the poetry competition held on Yuntang Pavilion on the near bank of the lake &#x2013; the top three participants will receive an invitation.<br>
<br>
There is also the martial arts contest at Quewu Square on the same day, a melee where up to thirty contestants are thrown into the ring, with the last man standing winning the invitation.<br>
<br>
Finally, in thanks to the prefect of Xuzhou for continuing to protect the city and the lands around it, the Manor will always grant an invitation to the prefect with which he can do as he sees fit.<br>
<br>
Since you are already here, you think you might as well try out for an invitation; the traveling merchants (and the gossip they bring) won&apos;t arrive until spring anyway.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>The top scholar of Xuzhou, an influential man by the name of Jiang Du, is a fellow of the manor. You approach him, intending to cajole, threaten, or outright steal the invitation if necessary.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You participate in the poetry competition on Yuntang Pavilion. As the top three participants may win an invitation, you should have a good chance as long as you place at least third. Besides, there are ways to get rid of competitors&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You participate in the martial arts contest. Even though it is a battle royale with the last man standing, and the participants are most likely all adults, you think you should be able to manage surviving such a contest. And again, there are ways to get rid of competitors&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You approach the prefect of Xuzhou, Zhu Yutong, in order to lay your hands on that particular invitation. It seems that he has been looking for someone to undertake a mission to Luoying Manor itself, and is offering the invitation to those who will. You might have competition for the task, however &#x2013; there will be a test, and the details of the job are unknown until you pass it.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Note: You may still get a chance to attempt another of these choices if you fail in the one you pick right now. But picking the poetry competition will outright rule out the martial arts contest, and vice versa, as they occur on the same day.

            <h3>九 · The Tournament at Quewu Square</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Tournament at Quewu Square</span></b><br>
<br>
You decide that your strengths are in combat, not poetry. After all, given the reputation of Luoying Manor as a hall of scholars, the competition in the poetry contest should be much tougher. With that optimistic thought in mind, you head to Quewu Square.<br>
<br>
Despite the cold, stalls have been set up all around the arena to cater to the large number of spectators. The hawkers call out their goods with gusto. There are the usual mantou, candied fruits and fried cakes being sold, but the hot pot vendors are also out in full force today. The stage for the competition is a large, raised square platform. It seems big enough to fit thirty people, though there isn&#x2019;t much room for manoeuvring with all thirty there. Making your way to the registration table, you find that most of the slots have already been taken up.<br>
<br>
Before you write your name down, you look around you; your arrival hasn&#x2019;t gone unnoticed by the other competitors. Between the public appearances you have made with Master Yao in the city, and your reputation as his apprentice, attempting to register under a false name would be a waste of time.<br>
<br>
You confidently write your name in ink, completing the registration.<br>
<br>
The rules of the tournament are as follows:<br>
<br>
One must not touch the ground outside the stage with any part of his body.<br>
<br>
One must not use any weapons, whether openly or concealed.<br>
<br>
One must not strike to kill or to maim.<br>
<br>
It appears that to lose, the participant must be thrown out of the ring. You continue to sniff about for more information. Most of the participants are in their late twenties, and probably more knowledgeable than you are in the field of martial arts. You spot a couple of thugs, a monk, and a few priests, though most of the participants appear to be scholarly in background<br>
<br>
After a while, you manage to strike up a conversation with a warrior-poet from Changsha, far to the south. His name is Ling Tong, a member of the Zifu Hall, a small gathering of gentlemen scholars in that city. According to him, the competitions do attract participants, but not as many as one would think. A good number of the fellows of the manor will pass their invitations on to worthy disciples or friends during a trial year, so that they may have a chance to be accepted. Others trade it for favours, though outright selling the invitation for money appears to be a taboo and could lead to a revocation of their fellowship.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;By the way, young master Xu, I will say that many of the competitors here will be looking to come to an understanding before the battle starts. Do you know what I speak of?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod, rubbing your chin &#x2013; a habit you have started to pick up from Master Yao stroking his beard all the time. It only makes sense. &#x201C;A non-aggression pact? That would make things neater.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Ling Tong beams at you. &#x201C;Exactly. This is not my first time participating, and I happen to know a few familiar faces. If you like, I could spread the word that you will be in on the pact. Your, ah, reputation for defeating the heir of Songfeng precedes you. I think I would rather you direct your ability at others, at least for the initial minutes of the match,&#x201D; says the man honestly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My reputation, eh?&#x201D; you say, curious. &#x201C;What have you heard, by the way?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well,&#x201D; the man speaks carefully with a smile, &#x201C;two tales. One where you are the villain, and one where you are the hero. In both, you strike down the young Rong with a single blow. I believe that, at least, is the truth. To be honest, after talking with you I would prefer the heroic tale of &#x2018;The Apprentice Defends His Beautiful Physician&#x2019;.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Beautiful&#x2026; wait, never mind.&#x201D; You have no idea what that old drunk Qi Liuwu told his beggars, but the results are certainly terribly embellished. Perhaps you should tell Master Yao to send a note to Qi about this.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So,&#x201D; says Ling Tong brightly, &#x201C;Will you accept my offer, young master Xu?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You accept his offer.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You accept his offer, but see if you can secretly form other pacts on your own.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You reject his offer.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
After your conversation with Ling Tong, you begin to wonder if there are any more things that you can do to increase your chances of victory&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>It&#x2019;s time to get sneaky. You haven&apos;t lived this past year without learning a thing or two about the concept of &apos;fairness&apos;.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You&#x2019;ve come prepared with a powder from Cao&#x2019;er. It is a fast-acting laxative which you will introduce into the shared jar where the fighters drink from. They can&#x2019;t fight you when they are fighting their stomach.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You gently and surreptitiously prick whatever lax fighters you can find with a needle lightly coated with Three Poison Powder. At these quantities it will not kill them, but it will likely cause nausea and dizziness after they take to the stage.<br>
<br>
<b>3. </b>You begin spinning a sob story, complaining about Master Yao forcing you into this competition. Though there are some ruffians here, many of them appear to be honest gentlemen. You hope to gain sympathy and make the other fighters lower their guard in the ring afterwards.<br>
<br>
<b>4. </b>You attempt to divide and conquer, following the precepts of the great strategists of old. Walking from one fighter to another, you begin to spread vague insinuations that certain fighters might resort to cheating, or have made rude comments about the other. <br>
<br>
(<i>Pick </i><span style="text-decoration: underline">at least</span> <i>one from the above choices, all A votes will be considered as one bloc in voting.</i>)<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do <i>all </i>of the above. If you&#x2019;re going to cheat, you should give it all you&#x2019;ve got.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You&#x2026; try not to cheat. Let this be a fair and honest match!

            <h3>十 · Try Again</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Try Again</span></b><br>
<br>
The gong reverberates throughout the square, signalling the start of the match.<br>
<br>
The roar of the crowd rises above the shout of the fighters as they rush at each other. From the corner of your eye you can spot a few others hanging around near the edge of the ring, like you are. There&#x2019;s no time to worry about them, though, as a bullish man charges at you, hoping to shove you out. You lower your body and feint towards your right. As he turns his body slightly, you dart quickly in the other direction. Your right foot catches the man&#x2019;s legs, knocking him off his feet. Without waiting for him to recuperate, you dive into the melee. You are not a small adolescent, but the difference in mass is too great for you to fight him head-on at the ring&#x2019;s side. One slip of your feet and he would toss you out of the ring.<br>
<br>
As you wander along the confusing battle, quickly shrugging off any stray hands that attempt to capture you find yourself face-to-face with people that you&#x2019;ve made an agreement with. A brief nod before turning away is all that is mutually given. Even so, you meet far more foes than you do friends;  it was hard to convince more than a handful of contestants by playing it straight. At the same time, however, you couldn&#x2019;t strike too freely because as it turns out, most of the ones who <i>did </i>agree to team up with you were fighting each other.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, two large arms encircle you just when you have dodged a rather scary blow from one of the participating priests. You struggle to get free, but the hairy man holding you up appears to be a grappler of no mean skill. Every time you seem to be slipping out of his grasp, he cuts you off with a well-timed strategic squeeze, shifting his grip to keep you subdued.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, hey,&#x201D; you say, desperate to find a way to overcome the man, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s this? Are you that interested in books too, uncle?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He certainly looks more at home using books to paper up his hut in the mountains, rather than being anywhere near Luoying Manor. His laugh booms in your ear as he shouts, &#x201C;Of course I am. I am the Bookwise Mountain Man, Shan! Now, boy, off you go!&#x201D; With a tremendous shout, he hurls you into the air before you can speak another word. You are sent flying clean over the heads of the other competitors, towards the edge of the ring.<br>
<br>
With a quick flip, you land on your feet instead of your back, but your balance is off. Your feet stumble backwards until you are teetering on the edge of the ring&#x2026; but you&#x2019;re still in it. Safe!<br>
<br>
Or so you think, as with a shout of &#x201C;Got you!&#x201D; the idiot who had charged at you at the start of the match blindsides you, carrying the both of you off the platform.<br>
<br>
And that&#x2019;s how your first tournament at Quewu Square ended.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You trudge back to the inn through the streets of Xuzhou with nothing to show for your participation but bruises.  You had acquitted yourself respectably, being the 16th participant out of the match, but losers do not get any prizes. Only one person was going to walk away with the invitation, and today that would be the Bookwise Mountain Man.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, hey there!&#x201D; shouts a bright, clear female voice. &#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you Master Yao&#x2019;s apprentice?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As you turn around, you see a pretty adolescent girl waving at you. She&#x2019;s dressed in the colorful clothes of the southern Miao tribe, with multiple bracelets and bangles adorning her hands and feet. Her long hair is left free, however &#x2013; you&#x2019;d usually see Miao girls tie them up in an ornate head decoration. The girl runs towards you excitedly.<br>
<br>
You sigh. Perhaps this is a business opportunity in the making, with the girl looking for Master Yao, and you&#x2019;d at least bring in some more money.<br>
<br>
Lost in thought, you are caught off guard when the girl throws her arms around you. She presses up against you, rubbing her cheek against yours. Is it some sort of Miao greeting? &#x201C;Now, let&#x2019;s see&#x2026; &#x201C; she whispers gently in your ear. You feel a sharp stinging pain in your back. As the Miao girl moves away from you with a spring in her step, humming lightly, you collapse to the ground as the pain grows. Your muscles begin to convulse and you find yourself staring up at the girl as she looks at you with a dazzling, expectant smile.<br>
<br>
Then, you pass out.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You feel your cheeks being pinched. You open your eyes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, look, Master Yao. Your no-good apprentice is awake,&#x201D; says the voice of the person who&#x2019;s just poisoned you.<br>
<br>
You&#x2019;re back at the inn, looking up at the Miao girl who is frowning at you. Slightly annoyed, you sit up suddenly, hoping to catch her head with yours and play it off as an accident.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Whoa!&#x201D; The girl jolts away quickly. She has good reflexes. &#x201C;What are you trying to do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t feel like lying in bed,&#x201D; you reply quickly. &#x201C;Who are you? What did you do to me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Yao, you raised such a rude apprentice,&#x201D; the girl says as she sprawls into a chair in an unlady-like posture. &#x201C;Then again, he&#x2019;s just a kid after all.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right, and poisoning me in the street was an adult thing to do, right?&#x201D; you retort at the girl who can&#x2019;t be older than you are.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, but you fell for a woman&#x2019;s touch, didn&#x2019;t you, <i>boy</i>?&#x201D; she smiles, with a hint of mockery in her lips. You can&#x2019;t find any words to respond this time &#x2013; she is right. You <i>did </i>let down your guard partially because she was a cute girl. She giggles, batting her eyelashes. &#x201C;Nothing to be ashamed of. An adult woman&#x2019;s charms are irresistable to a virgin boy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh yeah?&#x201D; you sneer. If she&#x2019;s going to continue provoking you... &#x201C;Like that body of yours is anywhere near a real adult&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;ve seen the real thing, and you just don&#x2019;t have the curves.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The girl flushes red. &#x201C;Wha-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop it, now,&#x201D; growls Master Yao, &#x201C;or I&#x2019;ll flick the both of you a dozen times in the head.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The both of you clam up immediately. It looks like the girl too has felt the power of Master Yao&#x2019;s Tanzhi Divine Skill (&#x5F48;&#x6307;&#x795E;&#x529F;, Finger-Flicking Divine Skill). She gives you a smile and sticks her tongue out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The two of you are going to get along <i>so </i>well. I wonder what bad luck I attracted to have her visit while you are around&#x2026;&#x201D; sighs your master. Cao&#x2019;er comes over to you with a bowl of medicine. &#x201C;&#x2026;drink &#x2026;counters poison,&#x201D; she mumbles. You do so dutifully. It is bitter, but nothing you can&#x2019;t handle.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Cao&#x2019;er, Cao&#x2019;er,&#x201D; calls out the Miao girl with a theatrical sigh, &#x201C;I lose to you again. You keep finding ways to defeat my poisons in mere hours.&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er nods in acknowledgement at the praise, though her fingers pull at your bedsheets nervously. &#x201C;So, does anyone mind telling me what is going on here?&#x201D; you say acidly. &#x201C;Why is there a mad girl in our room?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is Chi Qilin, a veritable pest,&#x201D; grumbles Master Yao. &#x201C;She appears every now and then to consult us on poisons.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I usually greet the master or Cao&#x2019;er with a sampling of my latest poison,&#x201D; she says with a sniff. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not my fault that his latest, most useless apprentice ever doesn&#x2019;t seem to know how to deal with poisons.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was distracted,&#x201D; you say, though your excuse sounds hollow.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, because of that ignominious defeat you had at the square? I was watching the match. I suppose anyone would be distracted at losing so badly,&#x201D; Qilin replies cheekily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to see you try better,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I could. I could beat you in ten moves. In fact, I already beat you in <i>one </i>move, out on the street,&#x201D; declares the girl triumphantly. There&#x2019;s something about her that reminds you of a certain someone that also rubs you the wrong way. You grit your teeth. You hate pushy girls.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s put that to the test, then. I&#x2019;ll take you on in a fair match.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sorry, I&#x2019;m allergic to fair matches. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m an experienced adult, and you&#x2019;re a no-good kid,&#x201D; she grins. &#x201C;Master Yao, where <i>did </i>you pick up this bumpkin?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao sighs loudly, seeing that he won&#x2019;t be getting any peace as long as the girl&#x2019;s in the room. &#x201C;Cao&#x2019;er brought him to me. He was half&#x2026; no, nine-tenths dead. Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t a problem for me. Why are <i>you </i>here bugging me, Miss Chi?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I just heard you were in town,&#x201D; she smiles brightly. &#x201C;Figured I could drop by and exchange some medical information with Cao&#x2019;er. It&#x2019;s just a coincidence, I was here in the first place to attend the winter conference at Luoying Manor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have an invite?&#x201D; you blurt out, unbelieving.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course. Who do you think I am?&#x201D; grins Qilin. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She probably obtained it from her father,&#x201D; says Master Yao wearily before you can say anything. He&#x2019;s probably going to kick the both of you out if another argument flares up. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s one of the fellows of the manor. Now, I want the two of you to stop getting on my nerves, or it&#x2019;s finger flicks. Do you understand?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You and Qilin nod quietly. As Yao turns back to his books, she sidles up to you on the bed. You edge away from her, sensing a threat of some sort.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you still mad?&#x201D; she says, her voice suddenly low and timid. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t mean it, you know.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, not really,&#x201D; you say awkwardly, though you still remain highly suspicious of her motives.<br>
<br>
Before you know it, she presses against you from behind tightly, her arms draped over your chest. It looks like you may actually have to retract that comment about not having curves. You feel her breath tickling your ear. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D; And then, she bites it gently.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, what are you-&#x201C; Even the chambermaids weren&#x2019;t this forward.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hush now,&#x201D; she whispers. &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t be long.&#x201D; Her arm moves up your chest and under your robes. Somehow you can&apos;t find the strength to pull away from her. Yao snorts loudly, muttering about kids nowadays. Cao&#x2019;er is already at the corner of the room, drawing circles with her fingers while making darting glances from between her tangled mat of hair.<br>
<br>
You feel something slither into your clothes, traveling down south.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What was that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She&#x2019;s already pushed herself away from you, a cruel, mocking smile on her face. &#x201C;Just my pet snake, Xiaoqing. She has all the curves you&#x2019;d want in a lady.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You&#x2019;re forced to get rid of Xiaoqing outside the room, as Master Yao makes good on his promise and kicks the both of you out after giving a very painful finger flick that leaves your foreheads red. The damnable Miao girl runs off giggling with her snake, leaving you half-clothed in front of the innkeeper who has come up to see what all the commotion is about.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s been a long day, but you can&#x2019;t rest yet. You&#x2019;ll need to think about what to do next; should you continue attempting to get into Luoying Manor, or should you give up for now?<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You try to get into contact with the scholar Jiang Du, but you find out that he&#x2019;s away, called off to the capital for urgent business. He appears to have left his invitation at home, however. You could sneak in, or perhaps you could persuade his wife to let you have it.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You attempt the prefect&#x2019;s test. It looks like he hasn&#x2019;t yet decided on a suitable candidate, and the opportunity is still open for you.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You go for one of the invitations of the top three contestants in the poetry competition. They will probably be drinking wine and exchanging poetry at Yuntang Pavilion daily until it&apos;s time to leave for the conference.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>That stupid, no-good, poisoning girl Chi Qilin has an invitation of her own. It&#x2019;d be proper payback to sneak up on her and take her invitation in recompense for all her mischief.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You give up on getting an invitation. You&apos;ll continue working here until spring comes and the roads are more conducive to travel. Then, after listening for information from the incoming travellers, you will move on, as a wanderer would.

            <h3>十一 · Visiting Madam Jiang</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Visiting Madam Jiang</span></b><br>
<br>
Jiang Du&#x2019;s house is in the eastern part of Xuzhou. Pretending to be stopping by for a house call, you ask for directions from the innkeeper and set off. The sun is beginning to set, but the streets are still packed. Xuzhou is home to a thriving night market, one of the largest in the region. The predecessor of the current Emperor had abolished the strict rules governing the opening hours of markets, leading to a boom in markets that operated at night, or in the cases of large cities such as Chang&#x2019;an and Yangzhou, around the clock. These markets dealt mainly in foods, clothing and accessories, and it was not uncommon for certain markets to attract a greater crowd at night than they would during the day.<br>
<br>
Out of the corner of your eye, in the bustle of the crowd, you catch a flash of familiar red. You still your footsteps, slow down your pace, and begin winding through the throng cautiously. You are sure that the girl is following you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, watch where you&#x2019;re going, kid!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You bump into a vendor hauling a large sack of candied fruits on his back. Apologizing, you help him pick up the scattered fruits. The vendor begins haranguing you for payment but you quickly run forward, disappearing into the crowd. There seems to be no sign of the girl behind you. Was it just your imagination after all? Cursing yourself for letting her get on your nerves and turn you paranoid, you make your way quickly to Jiang Du&#x2019;s house before the sun fully sets.<br>
<br>
You are greated by a cute, round-faced maidservant at the gates to his compound. Putting all thoughts of the aggravating Chi Qilin out of your mind, you put on your best palace smile.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Greetings,&#x201D; you bow low. &#x201C;I apologize for appearing at such a late hour, but my master bid me send urgent word to Master Jiang Du.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, but the master is out at the moment. He will not be back for a week, I expect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You feign disappointment at her words. &#x201C;Is that so? That is terrible! My master, Physician Yao Shunshi, had an important message for him. I cannot return before it is heard.&#x201D; It is a typical method that you&#x2019;ve used to gain access to merchants&#x2019; houses before, knowing that they are not around to prevent the money that they owe you for treatment from being subtly paid up on their behalf.<br>
<br>
The maidservant seems at a loss, her long locks tumbling as she looks around her nervously. As a servant it would be too forward of her if she offered to convey the message to her master. She doesn&#x2019;t seem experienced in the serving profession. &#x201C;If I might ask,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;How long have you been working here, miss?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I-I think,&#x201D; she stutters, &#x201C;perhaps about two months?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That explains why you look so fresh and vivacious,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Whenever my master sends me out on errands I always meet tired, old maids, so it&#x2019;s a pleasant surprise to see a girl like you greeting me at the doorstep.&#x201D; One thing you&#x2019;ve learned from the chambermaids &#x2013; youth gives you the license to be be blatant with flattery. They told you that an older man may be expected to lie to gain their favour, but a child&#x2019;s mouth is honest. You&#x2019;re not quite sure that&#x2019;s true in any way, but it&#x2019;s worked for you so far. &#x201C;You must be the prettiest and youngest servant in the household,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, of course not. That&#x2019;s not true at all,&#x201D; she blushes. &#x201C;All of the maidservants here are newly hired. I&#x2019;ve heard that the master likes to take on young servants because&#x2026;&#x201D; She falters, but you do not need her to finish her words to get the idea. She continues, &#x201C;That is why I cannot take your message. I am sorry. We are all new here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You smile at her comfortingly, offering her a way out. &#x201C;Perhaps the mistress of the house could take the message instead?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course! You&#x2019;re right!&#x201D; she smiles. She runs off into the house to get Madam Jiang. You heave a sigh of relief. You would much rather deal with these nice, kind girls than the pushy ones like Yunzi and Qilin. It does not take the maidservant long before she returns with Jiang Du&#x2019;s wife. She is tall and thin in both stature and face. Her expression is that of a frown as she scrutinizes you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What message is it, boy?&#x201D; she asks in a snappy manner.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, something from my master, Physician Yao Shunshi. It&#x2026; I can&#x2019;t tell it here, Madam Jiang. We need some privacy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Madam Jiang sighs. &#x201C;Are you sure it is important?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very important, madam,&#x201D; you say solemnly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fine,&#x201D; she sniffs, as she turns about and beckons at you to follow her. With a tip of the head to the maidservant, you follow Madam Jiang into the house.<br>
<br>
Walking through the hallways, you see that the maidservant at the gate was telling the truth &#x2013; most of the maids you see inside the house are relatively young. This is another thing you learnt about getting in and out of compounds; the inhabitants are just as important as planning escape routes and identifying the location of the money box. In this case, it seems like it&#x2019;ll pay off in another way. You are no expert yet, but experience has been a valuable teacher. Nothing instills the memory of a lesson well-learned like messing up and trying to escape a dozen angry cleaver-waving men.<br>
<br>
Madam Jiang leads you into a small study and closes the door. Turning to you, she folds her arms under her chest. &#x201C;Please be quick about it, boy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There actually two things, Madam Jiang.&#x201D; You see her frown in disapproval and quickly continue speaking. &#x201C;The first matter involves this year&#x2019;s invitation to Luoying Manor. My master told me that your husband was looking for someone to give it away to. He would be interested in obtaining it in return for a favour.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Give it away? I have not heard my husband speak of it. He was still planning to go when he ended up being called away to the capital.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am also authorized to offer taels in return for the invite,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; says Madam Jiang. &#x201C;We do not lack for money, but what are you offering? He will not be using the invite anyway.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You open your pouch, showing all that you have. It is rather meagre, by Jiang family standards.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that all?&#x201D; sniffs Madam Jiang. &#x201C;It would be hard to explain it to my husband if I let his invite go for so little. It would demean the invitation&apos;s value, even if it will be unused. I will have to think about it. Still, I have not heard of him wanting to give it away.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, that is strange. Perhaps my master heard wrongly, then.&#x201D; You fall back on your second plan. &#x201C;You must forgive my old master for believing such stories. Invitations are so hard to get, especially during a year in which fellows are selected. Everyone wants one. I believe your husband is one, madam?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, yes,&#x201D; she says bitterly. &#x201C;Not like it does his ego any good.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do not wish to cast aspersions on a gentleman&#x2019;s character, but staying in the middle of winter with a group of eccentrics in a manor run by a reclusive beauty must worry you so, Madam Jiang.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She laughs for the first time. &#x201C;You have a way with words for one so young. Perhaps you aspire to grow up to be a no-good scholar like my husband? He&#x2019;s also good with words.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not, I am just a humble physician&#x2019;s apprentice.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, of course you are,&#x201D; she says drily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If I may ask, though, I am personally interested in the invite. I&#x2019;ve heard that the design changes every year, and that it cannot be forged by mortal hands. I wonder if it wouldn&#x2019;t be-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It would be too much trouble, boy.&#x201D; Madam Jiang cuts you off quickly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going over to the second floor study to fetch it for you. Now, what is the second matter?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, that is a rather sensitive issue. You see, my master has also heard rumours of&#x2026; well, the maidservants in this house.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
At that, Madam Jiang&#x2019;s face grows dark. &#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not be angry, madam. My master wishes only to help. He understands that issues between men and women can be rather delicate, and that is why he sent me. He has heard of Madam Jiang, the dutiful wife who lifts the famed scholar Jiang Du to greater heights, and expresses his utmost respect. In return for a kind word in Master Jiang&#x2019;s ear, he would be willing to perform a simple favour.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A favour?&#x201D; Madam Jiang laughs again, her demeanour suddenly relaxing. &#x201C;Hm, you certainly are tactful about it. Are you going to poison all the harlots he&#x2019;s brought into the house? He never follows my advice on <i>that </i>part. I suppose rumours have spread so far that even the mountain-dwelling hermit physicians have heard of it. What a disgrace!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You pause momentarily. Her candour is unexpected; you had only been fishing in the dark from what little you could observe. It appears that she has much resentment against her husband. You might have stumbled across something that could be risky. &#x201C;Well, I&#x2026; no, that would go against my code, madam. All I was expected to do was to offer you a cleansing medicine that would purge your body of ill humours and increase your considerable beauty, or some private physician&#x2019;s lessons on the nature of the human body.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There is a sudden predatory gleam in Madam Jiang&#x2019;s eyes. A faint blush colours her cheeks. You don&apos;t like the way she&apos;s suddenly looking at you from head to toe. &#x201C;Private lessons, you say? It&apos;s funny you should say that. I have not had any <i>lessons</i> in a while. My useless husband certainly doesn&apos;t teach <i>me </i>what he knows. What manner of lessons are we discussing here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-well,&#x201D; you mumble, backing away slightly. Perhaps this was a mistake&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You give her the medicine. Of course, it is an actual cleansing medicine. The laxative you got from Cao&#x2019;er this morning, in fact. You have heard of the placebo effect from Master Yao. You&apos;ll inform her of the side-effects beforehand. As long as she believes it works&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You give her &#x2018;private lessons&#x2019;.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You don&#x2019;t offer any of the favours right now, telling her that you are only conveying the offer today and not the favours themselves.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You attempt to obtain the invite by sneaking into the second floor study.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You attempt to convince Madam Jiang to allow you to purchase the invite outright.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
A1 or B1 would mean you take the invite quietly, while she is otherwise distracted or... uh... exhausted from learning.<br>
<br>
A2 or B2 means you can bargain down the price or perhaps even get the invite by trading a favour.<br>
<br>
C1 means you do some sneaking after pretending to leave.<br>
<br>
C2 will be just as it says.

            <h3>十二 · Arrival at Luoying Manor</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Arrival at Luoying Manor</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, that was <i>rather </i>impressive,&#x201D; murmurs Madam Jiang as she looks up at the ceiling. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re&#x2026; strong. And so nimble.&#x201D; She shivers slightly. &#x201C;That was an <i>educational </i>session. You are unexpectedly experienced,&#x201D; chuckles the woman.<br>
<br>
The maids in the palace had trained you &#x2013; in secret, away from prying eyes &#x2013; when you came of age. The chambermaids often complained to you that most men cared only for their own pleasure, and so they were rather pleased to get their hands on a eager, confident and charming young male that they could thoroughly mould into a satisfying, attentive lover. Your meticulous training to become their <i>perfect</i> companion in bed had been interrupted before it could come to fruition, but all that was really left was to keep practicing what you had learnt. You might not be able to go all night without rest, but you had learnt plenty of techniques that capitalized on your strength and agility.<br>
<br>
Of course, you aren&#x2019;t about to reveal that to Madam Jiang.<br>
<br>
Besides, she had come with a surprise of her own &#x2013; her commanding aggression in pushing you down, and the experienced, shameless hunger with which she moved against your body from the start told you that Madam Jiang was someone who wasn&#x2019;t a stranger to participating in &#x2018;lessons&#x2019; with other men besides her husband. Halfway through, you had to wonder if you were the one being used up for her benefit here, and if you had been mistaken to come. Certainly, right now your body aches badly, as if you had been mauled lovingly by a devious beast.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, how much do you want?&#x201D; asks Madam Jiang nonchalantly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Pardon me? I don&#x2019;t-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you think I&#x2019;m like those simpering young maids?&#x201D; she laughs, a sly glint in her eyes. &#x201C;I can tell when a boy has another motive in mind. You are not one of those romantic fools, are you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You cannot do anything but shake your head wordlessly. &#x201C;Of course not,&#x201D; she says scornfully. She does not seem to respect you much. &#x201C;So, shall I consider this a free favour, or would you like to be rewarded for your sizeable performance? Unlike my husband, I don&#x2019;t like to receive without giving in return.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, well&#x2026;&#x201D; If there&#x2019;s a chance here, you are going to take it. Damn the consequences. &#x201C;Perhaps, the invite for my master?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She frowns. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s all you want? That useless piece of paper? You are really a dutiful apprentice, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You leave the Jiang house in the middle of the night with what you had come for, escorted out quietly by the maidservant that you had met. From her casual, polite expression, you get the idea that this is probably not an uncommon occurrence despite Madam Jiang telling you that it has been a while. It is probably mistaken to assume that what is &#x2018;a while&#x2019; to you will be the same amount of time to another person.<br>
<br>
When you get back to the inn, you find that Cao&#x2019;er is still awake and waiting for you. She stares at you for a while, and to your surprise, begins sniffing you all over. &#x201C;&#x2026;did you do it?&#x201D; she asks, in a tone you have never heard her use before. You gently push her away &#x2013; having her crawl all over you like that is stirring your mood up a bit despite your prior exertions; you&apos;re a healthy young male after all &#x2013; and affirm her suspicions. There&#x2019;s no point in lying. She puffs out her cheeks, looking sullen. Without another word, she goes off to her bed and curls up under the sheets in a huffy manner.<br>
<br>
The next morning, Master Yao sits you down at the table. His face is sombre and serious as he places a small jar of ointment in front of you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Open it,&#x201D; he says.<br>
<br>
You do so. A pungent stink assails your nostrils. The jar contains a foul-smelling, oily ointment. In the middle of the ointment floats a strange, long tube, closed off at one end. You poke at it and pick it up &#x2013; it&#x2019;s stretchy, probably part of a some animal&#x2019;s intestine. You look at Master Yao.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re going to go around doing anything that moves, it is best to be protected,&#x201D; he says with an entirely straight face. &#x201C;This is my latest medical creation, based off the preventive caps they hand out in the brothels. Of course, it is far superior to those little toys. I call it Yao&#x2019;s Protective Sheath. The special ointment makes the lamb&#x2019;s intestine a lot more reliable for vigorous use without compromising on sensitivity. It also wards off illnesses a lot more effectively. I think it will be a good addition to the herbal wares we have.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master,&#x201D; you say calmly, looking at the dripping sheath. &#x201C;This will never take off.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What, why not?&#x201D; He looks genuinely surprised.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It stinks,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hmph,&#x201D; snorts Master Yao. &#x201C;They all stink by the end anyway. That is merely a minor detail. Its performance is unparalleled.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not like this,&#x201D; you shake your head ruefully. &#x201C;Why are you showing me this anyway?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you think I don&#x2019;t know what you were up to?&#x201D; he asks, raising his eyebrows. &#x201C;Now, I couldn&apos;t care less who you tumble into bed with, but you should always be mindful of health considerations as well as the possibility of sowing your reckless wild oats. Keep it with you. I will teach you how to make the treating ointment &#x2013; you should be able to handle the lamb intestine extraction by yourself. Perhaps you will find a way to reduce the smell, if that concerns you. You are my apprentice after all, you should be able to manage that much.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look at the surprising gift again. Is this his way of looking out for you? &#x201C;Thank you, master. I did not know you cared so much.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What, of course not,&#x201D; he mutters, grumbling. &#x201C;It would trouble Cao&#x2019;er if I had to take a knife to you to heal some more persistent illnesses of the genitalia. Now, have you gotten what you came to Xuzhou for?&#x201D; Master Yao changes the topic quickly while you are still wondering what Cao&#x2019;er has to do with this.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;ll be boarding the boat tomorrow. The conference will last for three days &#x2013; I may be there up to four days, if I manage to enter the inner court. Do you need me to get anything for you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao shakes his head, stroking his beard. &#x201C;No, I don&#x2019;t think so. Search for what you deem interesting. It&#x2019;s your journey to make, not mine.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod and bow to your master. Dropping the protective sheath back into its jar, you wipe your fingers before storing it away carefully.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The boat ride to the manor was relatively uneventful &#x2013; you had half been expecting the boat to spring a leak and sink. Perhaps your luck is turning for the better? Thankfully, Cao&apos;er had not sulked for long, having seen you off with a tight hug at the jetty in Xuzhou. She whispered something about Yao&apos;s gift, and told you to protect yourself. You&apos;re not sure what type of image the girl has of you in her head now, but you&apos;re sure she&apos;s mistaken. You&apos;ll have to correct that misconception when you return.<br>
<br>
As the boatman steers his vessel through the icy mist of the lake, the outline of the manor looms out at you. You disembark together with the other passengers. Three of them were the winners of the poetry competition &#x2013; two middle-aged, one young. There was the mountain man who had been the indirect cause of your defeat in the tournament, and then two strangers you have not seen before. Then, there was that damned girl.<br>
<br>
Chi Qilin winks as she leaps onto the pier ahead of you. She had spent the boat ride chatting animatedly with the other men, gaining their attention. That suited you fine &#x2013; it just meant you didn&#x2019;t have to put up with her. She opens her mouth to speak to you, but thankfully the white and pink-garbed servants of Luoying Manor arrive to save you from the girl. They begin checking the invitations. After completing the checks, you are led to the manor house itself. The trees lining the pathway are barren in winter, but would probably prove to be a splendid sight when spring arrives. Luoying Manor is larger than you expected, and more luxurious. Shun would probably not feel out of place staying here.<br>
<br>
The servants take your little entourage to a large banquet hall, decorated with long silk banners. Here the air is warm, though you see no fire in the hall. It is already filled with people; there are probably a hundred guests. Some are seated at the numerous tables, while others are mingling and engaged in conversation. At the front of the hall is a raised dais for the mistress of the manor who has not yet arrived.<br>
<br>
All of the attendees are older than you are &#x2013; the ones your age only number two: the poison girl, and the young scholar. You are shown where to sit, and just as you do so&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It looks like I&#x2019;m sitting here too,&#x201D; says Qilin cheerfully as she slips into the empty seat next to you. When you do not respond to her, she continues, &#x201C;What, are you still mad at me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Nothing good will come of ignoring her &#x2013; she might just keep pestering you. You give up and engage her in conversation. Since her father is a fellow, she should know more than you about this conference. She shouldn&apos;t be entirely useless.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You stand up and search for an obvious candidate to talk to. The young scholar is nearby, looking pensively at the garden outside. Perhaps you could talk to him instead. If he won the poetry competition at his age he must be a rather good scholar.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Even in the mingling crowd, there is one man who seems to have been given a very wide berth, sitting alone near the center of the hall. He has come without a shirt in winter, revealing his powerfully built and scarred body. You attempt to approach the lone, dangerous-looking man.

            <h3>十三 · The Winter Solstice Conference Begins</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Winter Solstice Conference Begins</span></b><br>
<br>
You ignore Qilin and get up from your seat. There are better things for you to do than talk to her &#x2013; for example, you could approach the mysterious, shirtless man sitting alone in the center of the hall. As you draw closer to the man, you hear Qilin shouting at you frantically, but whatever she&#x2019;s saying is none of your concern. The whispers of the crowd grow louder and more worried at your actions, but you are not about to let that stop you.<br>
<br>
The powerful man sits cross-legged on the floor. His muscled body is lined with weathered scars. From his face he looks to be in his forties, with long, wild hair and a short, grizzled beard. You clear your throat, slightly nervous, and greet him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hello, sir.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The entire hall falls silent. Every pair of eyes in the room is now focused on you and the man.<br>
<br>
He turns his head, looking at you straight on. His eyes seem dull, as if he is not entirely there.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What manner of business do you have with me?&#x201D; The man&#x2019;s voice is polite and cultured, in a way entirely unbefitting his appearance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, I am new here, and I was just wondering if you would-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
He stands up, cutting you off. Up close, the man towers over you by more than a head&#x2019;s length, and you are rather tall for your age. His dull eyes fixate upon you, and you feel a tremendous wave of fear sweep over your body. It is a feeling you recognize &#x2013; you have encountered it at least twice before. You felt it when fighting the woman-in-black. You felt it when duelling Rong Zhiyu at Songfeng. It is the fear of death, and this man scares you so much more than the both of them combined. You feel that if he makes a move right now, you would be more certain of your death than if you sprang in front of the Emperor naked and pissed in his face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Someone get that boy back! He&#x2019;ll get killed! Don&apos;t just stand around here!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, <i>you </i>go then! I&#x2019;m not going to cross <i>him</i>! We step into his range and we are minced meat!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Panicked murmurs come from all around you, as the crowd reaffirms your sudden realization that this has been a bad decision.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it has always been your bad habit not to back down in the face of death.<br>
<br>
Forcing your legs to stay upright with all of your will, you maintain your polite smile. &#x201C;I was wondering if you would be so kind as to acquaint me with your good self,&#x201D; you say, a bead of sweat trickling down your face. You hear a few gasps from the crowd.<br>
<br>
A flicker of interest sparks in his dark eyes. A smile stretches itself slowly over his face. His gaze turns sharp and keen, staring intently into you. The bearded man places his large hands over your shoulders, channeling his internal energy into your body. You feel a throb of dark warmth seeping into your core. Then, he speaks, &#x201C;Your <i>qi</i>. How very interesting. How beautifully chaotic, like the raging swirls of a stormy ocean. You have rare talent. It would be a shame if I did not let it blossom.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Then, his smile turns into a wicked grin. &#x201C;You will be my next apprentice. I have just run out of living ones. Come, I am taking you home.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His grip turns as solid as steel. You wince in pain as you try to shrug him off, but your efforts prove futile. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t!&#x201D; you say quickly. &#x201C;I already have a master, and I&#x2019;m bound to him-&#x201C; The man snatches up your arm &#x2013; the one with the mark of poison. &#x201C;This? I suppose it <i>is </i>a conundrum. I cannot cure it, and I am afraid I would rather you not die of petty poison. Still, I do have a solution.&#x201D; He pulls at your arm gently. The crowd begins to shout, calling for help.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Take off the limb and the poison will not reach your heart. Do not worry. Under my tutelage you will still be more powerful than any man, even with one arm.&#x201D; With nary a hint of effort from the man, you feel your shoulder joint dislocate. You can already imagine your arm flying off in his grasp, spraying blood all over the hall.<br>
<br>
A sweet, gentle fragrance fills the air. &#x201C;Master Zhang,&#x201D; says a woman&#x2019;s voice. It is a beautiful voice, soothing and pleasant to the ear. You feel a slender hand place itself over your dislocated arm. The man frowns, as if taken by surprise. Neither of you had sensed her approach, it seems. &#x201C;Lady Ji. I am afraid I am preoccupied with some personal business at the moment.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Zhang,&#x201D; repeats the voice, sterner this time. &#x201C;This boy is a guest of the manor, as are you. It is not proper etiquette to harm another guest, nor is it polite to abduct one before the conference has even started.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a loud sigh, Zhang lets go of your dislocated arm. It falls limply to your side, causing you to groan from the pain. &#x201C;Very well. As you wish, Lady Ji. I will take him with me after the winter solstice conference.&#x201D; He laughs cruelly as he turns around.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you not wish to participate?&#x201D; asks Lady Ji, standing out of your sight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have decided to spend my time at the inner court this year. Until later, Lady Ji,&#x201D; says Zhang without looking back. He walks out of the hall. The crowd scatters hurriedly, with not a person wishing to get in his way.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What a capricious man,&#x201D; sighs the lady of the house. She turns you around and you get a glimpse of her for the first time. It would not be wrong to say that she is possibly the most beautiful person you have ever met. Her complexion is exceedingly fair and clear, and her features as exquisite as the finest dolls. Her clothing is made of the finest silk, after the ancient fashion of court ladies from a much older dynasty that you cannot identify. The prettiest concubine in the Imperial Palace would be as a dull pheasant hen in her presence. Though you cannot pin-point her age, she does not seem a day over thirty.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you okay, child?&#x201D; she asks. You give her a deep bow in response. &#x201C;My arm is still attached to my body. It&#x2019;s not even a flesh wound. I am eternally grateful for your assistance, Lady Ji.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Think nothing of it,&#x201D; smiles the lady with a radiance that would outshine even the sun. &#x201C;While you are here, you are my guest, and under my protection. Luoying Manor places utmost importance on the safety of all who reside here.&#x201D; With a polite nod of the head, Lady Ji sweeps away from you and towards the dais at the front of the hall.<br>
<br>
You stagger back to your seat, where Chi Qilin is staring at you. &#x201C;Wow,&#x201D; she says. Her eyes seem to be full of admiration. &#x201C;That was insane. You went and talked to the Southern Maniac. You actually did it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, so that was him?&#x201D; you groan.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You really didn&#x2019;t know? Would you have gone to him if you did?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give that question two seconds of thought before shaking your head. &#x201C;No. I think I would still have approached him even if I knew his identity beforehand.&#x201D; And that was the truth &#x2013; you <i>do </i>think you would probably have done so.<br>
<br>
Qilin laughs, tickled at your answer. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a strange one. Well, I must admit, you really have guts. I think I see you in a different light now.&#x201D; She stands up and walks behind you. Instinctively you move away from her; who knows what manner of poison she plans to inflict upon you this time?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m just going to do this&#x2026;&#x201D; Her hands flash forward before you can react and grip your dislocated shoulder firmly. With a gentle push, almost as if she is giving you a massage, she nudges it back into position. You give a little shout of pain. &#x201C;There,&#x201D; she says cheerfully. &#x201C;The joint-dislocating poison is a favourite over at our place, and I&#x2019;ve had to learn how to fix such problems myself after getting hit by it one time too many.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You swing your shoulder about, flexing it. It&#x2019;s pretty much perfect &#x2013; you couldn&#x2019;t do any better yourself. You are about to thank her when she interrupts you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, that&#x2019;s the second favour you owe me,&#x201D; grins Qilin. You give her a stare of disbelief. &#x201C;I could have done it myself in a while! Wait, <i>second </i>favour? What&#x2019;s the first one?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, think about that yourself,&#x201D; she smiles mischievously.<br>
<br>
Before you can press her for more details, Lady Ji commences her welcome speech. The hall falls into respectful silence as the winter solstice conference begins.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The post-banquet affair is set aside for mingling between the attendees. This is a good chance to trawl for more information. You walk around, asking about:<br>
<br>
(Pick only two)<br>
<br>
<b>I. </b>Lady Ji.<br>
<br>
<b>II. </b>The trial for fellowship.<br>
<br>
<b>III. </b>The Ten Great Swords.<br>
<br>
<b>IV. </b>The Southern Maniac, Zhang Jue.<br>
<br>
<b>V. </b>Your strange qi condition, though you do not reveal that you have it.<br>
<br>
<b>VI. </b>Yuhua Hall and the Yuhua Duqing Palm, as well as the woman-in-black.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The conference is also a place where scholars and other knowledgeable and skilled persons present what they have learnt. Many of the people here are masters in their field who excel at conveying their teachings in an interesting manner, and there is much to be learnt &#x2013; it is a pity you do not have the time and learning prowess to absorb it all. Strangely, the atmosphere of the conference seems to boost your attention and concentration; you find yourself remembering more than you usually would, helping you learn faster.<br>
<br>
Many little presentations happen over the course of the first day, and while attending them you find that you have learnt the most from:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>A very impressive lecture by a distinguished and renowned orator on the art of persuading people. (Speech +3)<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>An enlightening guide on how to combine scholarly knowledge with artistic skill, letting both blossom. (Scholarly Knowledge +2, Artistic Skill +2)<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>A brilliant demonstration about sleight-of-hand movements by a mysterious, masked street performer. (Sleight of Hand +3)<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>An exciting lecture on the principles of weapon that allows people with zero knowledge about handling weapons to quickly learn the basics of how to use one. (Axe+1 , Bow+1, Saber+1, Spear+1, Staff+1, Thrown Weapons +1)<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You retire to your room that night, exhausted. Slumping into your bed, you drift off into a nice slumber&#x2026; until you are rudely awakened by a warm weight atop your body.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s&#x2026; what&#x2019;s this heavy thing?&#x201D; you groan out as you try to push it off you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, that&#x2019;s rude!&#x201D; whispers Chi Qilin angrily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is even <i>more </i>rude for you to be coming into my room and sitting on top of me in the middle of the night when I am trying to get some sleep!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hush, be quiet. It&#x2019;s the middle of the night. People need their sleep. You are a very inconsiderate brat, aren&apos;t you?&#x201D; says Qilin. In the darkness you can barely make out her finger held to her lips.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, everyone is trying to sleep, except for certain unladylike girls who creep into a man&#x2019;s bedroom. Is this the adult behaviour you are so proud of?&#x201D; you retort quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is this not adult behaviour?&#x201D; she asks innocently, though you know she is mocking you. &quot;Adults are known for sneaking into each others&apos; chambers.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, not yet,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Here, let me show-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
Qilin lets out a brief squeak and leaps away from you before you can grab her to teach her a lesson. &#x201C;W-Well, I am here for another thing, not to dally with a virgin boy.&#x201D; She changes the subject quickly, though she seems a little flustered.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;To be honest, I need your help,&#x201D; says the girl, regaining her composure quickly. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s something strange going on with the young scholar that came with us and the other two strangers.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s this, more of your busybody meddling? What business is that of yours, or for that matter, mine?&#x201D; you sigh tiredly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, don&#x2019;t you find it suspicious? I spotted them walking off further into the manor grounds just now. They might be going towards the rumoured inner court.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then follow them, if you&#x2019;re so interested,&#x201D; you say irritably.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A lady shouldn&#x2019;t be wandering about in the middle of the night unchaperoned,&#x201D; says Chi Qilin with a straight face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why me?&#x201D; you groan exasperatedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I thought you would be gutsy enough to do it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I was asking the heavens why I am being cursed with this misfortune.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s just your karma. You were definitely a great villain in your previous life... probably a big seducer of women and murderer of hundreds. Do more good deeds &#x2013; like helping me out, and perhaps it&#x2019;ll go away!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You can&#x2019;t believe the cheek of this girl.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You go with her. You are curious about what she said anyway.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You have better things to do than go with her. Like sleep.

					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Midnight in Luoying</span></b><br>
<br>
You wonder just why you are doing this. Chi Qilin leads the way, darting between the shadows of the naked trees with all the ease of a weasel. She&#x2019;s a much better sneak than you are, but that is not surprising considering her duplicitous nature. &#x201C;I hear them ahead,&#x201D; whispers Qilin as she presses herself flat against the wall, while you kneel besides her. The both of you peek around the corner.<br>
<br>
The young scholar and the other two men are standing in front of a gate that leads to the inner compound. The scholar is unarmed, while the other two men have sabers hanging from their  They appear to be arguing, though you cannot make out their words from this distance. The scholar begins gesticulating wildly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Falling out between thieves?&#x201D; you murmur.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;The scholar is talking about&#x2026;  let&#x2019;s see, a sword? Family? I can&#x2019;t read the lips of the other two, it&#x2019;s too dark and the angle is wrong.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
One of the men draws his saber. Instantly, the scholar begins to shout for help, backing away.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, what do we do?&#x201D; asks Qilin. &#x201C;Are we going to help?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>You </i>brought me all the way out here and you ask me this?&#x201D; you respond with a snort of disbelief.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a lady,&#x201D; she simpers. &#x201C;A gentleman should lead the way. Besides, they don&#x2019;t look too tough.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How good are you at fighting? I&#x2019;m not sure we should stick our necks out.&#x201D; After the events of today, you can&#x2019;t help but be cautious.<br>
<br>
With a grin, Qilin whips out a pair of throwing knives. &#x201C;Allow me to demonstrate.&#x201D; Barely taking any time to aim, she hurls it at the saber-wielding man before you have time to remind her that killing isn&#x2019;t allowed on the manor grounds.<br>
<br>
The knife flies straight and true &#x2013; it hits the man&#x2019;s head hilt-first, causing him to shout out in pain.  The other man whips his head around and spots the two of you immediately. You bemoan your bad luck and run out at him, cursing the troublesome Qilin as you do. If you ran away now you&#x2019;d never hear the end of it from her. At any rate, since you are already out here, you might as well see this through.<br>
<br>
The other man pulls out his saber as you charge at him. The moment he raises his weapon, a knife hits his hand point first, sinking into his palm. He drops the saber, screaming in agony, and you drive your knee into his stomach. As he staggers back, groaning, you shift your footing and sweep him off his feet with a kick.<br>
<br>
The first assailant leaps at you before you can finish off your opponent, his saber narrowly missing your chest. As you quickly withdraw, a stone flies at the man &#x2013; he blocks it with the flat of his blade. &#x201C;What happened to your knives?&#x201D; you shout.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I only brought two! Sorry!&#x201D; comes the reply. &#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t expecting any trouble!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What? You weren&#x2019;t-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
You are forced to cut your indignant shout short as you roll away from another slash. Though Qilin&#x2019;s constant stone throwing keeps the man off balance, he is skilled enough to deflect the stones while leaving no room for you to press your attack. You draw your dagger and attempt to stab at him, but your hasty attack is poorly executed. With a flourish of his saber, he knocks your puny blade away, leaving you open for a counter attack.<br>
<br>
The young scholar tackles the man in the back. The man staggers forward, but is otherwise unmoved. With a quick blow, he knocks the scholar to the ground. You attempt to move forward, but the saber flashes back into a guarding stance as the man&#x2019;s eyes dart towards the girl behind you.<br>
<br>
This time, however, two stones fly at him &#x2013; he hits one away and is nailed by the other between the eyes. Qilin had lulled him into a predictable pattern by throwing only one stone at a time. With a yell, you step forth and seize the opportunity. You drive your dagger towards his chest.<br>
<br>
There is a dull clang as your dagger hits metal in the folds of his robes. As the man pulls away, his clothes tear. A bronze crest falls out &#x2013; that is probably what you hit.<br>
<br>
You hear shouts in the distance &#x2013; there are people approaching with lanterns in their hands. The man spits on the ground and runs off before you can stop him. His injured compatriot remains moaning on the ground, clutching his hand. You go to help the scholar up as some servants and guests of the manor arrive, attracted by the commotion.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Miss Chi,&#x201D; you say in a sickly sweet voice, &#x201C;Could you go talk to the crowd? You got me into this mess after all.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course, Mister Xu,&#x201D; she replies, in the same sickly sweet tone, &#x201C;I would be delighted to help you out again after just saving your life with my throwing skills.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As Qilin goes off to explain the situation, the scholar bows deeply, thanking you. &#x201C;My name is Xiahou Yu. I believe we were on the same boat. Thank you for coming to my aid.&#x201D; You return his bow. &#x201C;I am Xu Jing. Don&#x2019;t mention it, anyone would have done the same. May I ask why you were out here at night? Had I not been out on a stroll, things may have ended poorly for you, Master Xiahou.&#x201D; He grimaces, looking at his remaining assailant. The man is being tied up by two servants of the manor, with Qilin proudly ordering them around as if she owns the place already.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is a personal matter. I had reason to believe one of the two men &#x2013; the man that escaped &#x2013; knew something about a recent calamity to befall my family. I decided to tail them, and then confront them.&#x201D; Xiahou Yu sighs loudly, looking up at the moon with a wistful expression. &#x201C;I suppose I am still too na&#xEF;ve to be travelling in the <i>jianghu </i>by myself.&#x201D; You realize that you have heard of his surname recently, and in connection with a sword, too. The Xiahou clan, who were rumoured to have one of the Ten Great Swords, and who were reportedly attacked and killed by mysterious villains recently.<br>
<br>
Yu bends down, picking up the bronze crest that the man had dropped. &#x201C;Perhaps this will give me a clue. Do you recognize this, Master Xu?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Your breath catches in your throat as the emblem on the crest comes into view. You recognize that symbol &#x2013; it is the seal of the Emperor&#x2019;s secret police, which you have seen but a few times. You doubt that the man you fought was one of them &#x2013; they would be far more skilled, and wouldn&#x2019;t leave such incriminating evidence behind &#x2013; but he could be an auxiliary or a hired sword with connections.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Xu?&#x201D; asks the scholar again. You are unsure how to respond.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is an imperial symbol, Master Xiahou.&#x201D; Again, Lady Ji comes to your rescue, appearing mysteriously by your side with no hint of her coming. &#x201C;I will tell you more about it later in private. For now, you should retire to your chambers and get some rest for tomorrow.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xiahou Yu blushes and bows to the lady. Giving you a quick smile, he walks off, a servant joining him as an escort.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, that was fun!&#x201D; giggles Qilin as she comes to your side to greet the lady of the manor. &#x201C;Good evening, Lady Ji.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are out of your mind,&#x201D; you sigh. &#x201C;We could have been killed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Events were under control. There was no need to worry,&#x201D; says Lady Ji enigmatically, with a slight smile on her lovely lips. &#x201C;Now, I would have words with the both of you immediately. You have been rather&#x2026; adventurous. It would be remiss of me to allow you two to run about further without having your audience.&#x201D; You are not sure whether she means to praise you or admonish you.<br>
<br>
Following Lady Ji, you are brought to a small, brightly lit room. The walls are covered with beautiful ink paintings. The lady takes her seat and gestures for the two of you to follow suit.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing,&#x201D; she calls out your name in a soft voice that would mesmerize any person. &#x201C;Born under an unlucky star, brought from poverty to riches, and cast out from riches to poverty. Your life has charted an interesting path indeed. Having tasted the sweet fruits of freedom, you no longer yearn for life in the palace so strongly, do you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Whoa. Wow,&#x201D; exclaims Qilin. &#x201C;Wait a minute. You&#x2019;re a noble?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Your back is tense and straight as you stare ahead of you. What is Lady Jing playing at by saying this in front of others? For that matter, how does she know of your background?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In a way, yes. You can call Xu Jing a noble. He has had a noble&#x2019;s education.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin begins grinning mischievously, as if she&#x2019;s planning some sort of scheme in her mind. You are about to retort when the lady speaks again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And what about you, princess of poison?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
That shuts her up quickly, her expression changing from devious to shocked in a second.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your clan dangles their secrets above your head, daring you to taste the forbidden fruit. Your uncle and master of the sect has placed great expectations upon you, as his designated successor. You may seem driven, but you are uncertain inside, are you not? Are the secrets worth it? Are they worth killing your warmth, making you cold inside?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin laughs nervously. &#x201C;My father said that you would be a tough woman to handle, Lady Ji. He was not wrong.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Everyone has their own past, Chi Qilin.&#x201D; The lady addresses the both of you. &#x201C;I will not say why I have revealed some of your secrets today. It is something you will have to ponder.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps the lady might be kind enough to reveal some of her own secrets as part of this mutual pondering session,&#x201D; you reply, trying to get an advantage on the situation. &#x201C;I must say that I am intrigued.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;An interesting suggestion. Perhaps I will, but not today.&#x201D; She gives a little chuckle of pleasure and turns to Qilin, looking at her straight in the eye. &#x201C;You will not be selected as a fellow this year, but should you wish it, you will have an excellent chance in four years&#x2019; time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin immediately begins pouting. &#x201C;Seriously? That&#x2019;s no fun. Father&#x2019;s going to laugh at me and refuse to teach the more advanced poisons.&#x201D; She doesn&#x2019;t seem to depressed about the matter, despite her act.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now, about your standing, Xu Jing&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Lady Ji turns her eyes towards you. You stare back, meeting her gaze without flinching. Her beautiful eyes are dark, speckled with hints of green. You wonder if it&#x2019;s just a trick of the light.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Answer this question with a simple yes or no. Do you desire to become a fellow of the manor?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Yes.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>No.

            <h3>十五 · The Southern Maniac</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Southern Maniac</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are an honest person,&#x201D; says Lady Ji. &#x201C;Very well. I shall grant you your desire.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What? Why does <i>he</i> get to join?&#x201D; protests Qilin indignantly. Lady Ji only looks at her and smiles gently. &#x201C;Because it was decreed by fate. Do not worry, Lady Chi. You will get your chance in four years&#x2019; time. Now, I will have to request that you leave us for a while &#x2013; what follows next is by tradition private.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Sticking her tongue out at you, Qilin reluctantly leaves the room. With a wave of her hand, Lady Ji beckons her servants over. They place two old teacups and an equally ancient-looking teapot in front of you. Steam is still rising from the spout; the tea is freshly brewed. &#x201C;Serve the tea to indicate your status as the newest fellow of the manor. Drink the tea to demonstrate that you are a fellow of the manor. Then, the induction will be complete,&#x201D; intones one of the servants.<br>
<br>
You do so, carefully pouring out the tea into the two cups. With a respectful bow, you hold out one of the cups with both hands. Lady Ji accepts it gracefully, and with a swift gesture upends the cup, letting the tea splash over the floor. &#x201C;With this, the gods of the earth recognize us.&#x201D; You take up your own cup and down the contents in a single gulp. A slight chill runs through your brain as you do so. &#x201C;With this, the immortals of the heavens bind us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The ritual is finished. The price has been paid. Congratulation, Xu Jing. You are now a fellow of Luoying Manor.&#x201D; Lady Ji smiles warmly. &#x201C;Your name and visage will be made known to all the servants here after the winter solstice conference has ended; you will then have use of any room you wish&#x2026; except my own chambers, of course.&#x201D; You blush despite yourself.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you, my lady. You are too kind. I did not expect the ritual to be so simple,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Simplicity is enlightening. Throughout the ages, Luoying Manor has abided by simplicity in principle, if not in deeds. Therefore, the ritual is simple. It calls for a person to cast away what he already knows in order to gain an open mind so that he may learn in a state of humility.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You try to wrap your head around the lady&#x2019;s words. &#x201C;You mean&#x2026; the price is some of my knowledge?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You may put it that way if you like, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Lady Ji amusedly. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t feel any different. I can&#x2019;t tell if I&#x2019;ve forgotten anything,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How would you remember that which you have forgotten?&#x201D; laughs Lady Ji. &#x201C;In any case, dear boy, you should retire to your chambers. The night is drawing to a close, and you should rest.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The next day, you wake up well after the sun has risen. Upon making your way to the main hall you are beset by Qilin almost immediately. She begins pestering you with a barrage of questions about what happened after she left.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you eavesdrop or peek in on us?&#x201D; you say with a mocking grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wanted to! But the servants were really too alert for me to do anything,&#x201D; she complains. &#x201C;So, what was it like?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was rather simple,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Just some tea, and then she tells me I&#x2019;ve lost a bit of my knowledge.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No further secrets I don&#x2019;t already know from my father, then,&#x201D; sighs Qilin as her shoulders slump in dejection. &#x201C;I thought there&#x2019;d be something to help me pass the trials.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Xu! Miss Chi!&#x201D; Xiahou Yu approaches the both of you with a hearty greeting. &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t had the chance to thank you for your aid last night.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, it was nothing,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;Justice had to be served.&#x201D; You scowl at her. As the young scholar begins to warm up to you, you discover that your suspicions of his background are correct. He is of the Xiahou clan, which has been recently exterminated by unknown assailants, and he is searching for any clues that may help him discover the mastermind behind the attack. Despite being prone to a certain amount of pompousness, he appears to be a good person at heart.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will be heading down to Yangzhou after this,&#x201D; says Xiahou Yu. &#x201C;I have heard that there is a respected place called Yuhua Hall which is known for its information-gathering capabilities. Hopefully I will find some leads there.&#x201D; You suppose a brothel does hear many gossip from its customers, and it is respected in its own way, but Yu doesn&#x2019;t appear to know that it is one. You spot Qilin smirking from the corner of your eye, a slight blush on her cheeks.<br>
<br>
Well, it&#x2019;s not your duty to tell him about the place. Besides, Yu seems so tense most of the time that it looks like he could do with some refreshment.<br>
<br>
The rest of the conference passes without a hitch; you manage to learn little more as most of the participants begin splitting up into private circles for heavy scholarly discussion beyond your capability to follow. Despite having become a fellow, the inner court will remain closed to you until the conference ends &#x2013; it looks like you will not be officially confirmed until then.<br>
<br>
On the third and last day, Lady Ji appears to announce the fellows that have been selected this year. The new fellows are Guye Aluba, a nomad from the far north, Shan, the Bookwise Mountain Man, yourself, and to your surprise, Xiahou Yu. The four of you are escorted to the dais to applause from the rest of the attendees.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, Lady Ji approaches you, a rare look of concern on her face. She leans in close to whisper in your ear. &#x201C;Xu Jing, you must make haste back to your master immediately. I have prepared a boat at the pier.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is the hurry, my lady?&#x201D; you respond, puzzled.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Zhang Jue has just left for Xuzhou. I fear he may be looking for your master.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You jump off the boat before it has finished docking and break into a run. If the Southern Maniac has reached Master Yao and Cao&#x2019;er&#x2026;<br>
<br>
You dash up the stairs of the inn and fling the doors to the room wide open. Master Yao is seated at the table, with Cao&#x2019;er huddling behind him. Zhang Jue is perched on a chair across from your master, a teacup in his hand. Then, there are a group of wrinkled, stern looking old nuns standing in the corner of the room furthest away from the Southern Maniac.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, you are back, Jing,&#x201D; Yao says calmly. &#x201C;We have some visitors.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are early, my apprentice,&#x201D; says Zhang. &#x201C;Have you found out all you needed to know?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are the one who has stolen the Yuchang Sword,&#x201D; says one of the nuns as she shakes her horsetail whip at you. &#x201C;We request that you return it to us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have Emei&#x2019;s beloved phallic object in your hands?&#x201D; grins Zhang suddenly. &#x201C;How amusing!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The nuns sputter in outrage, but do not make any attempt to move towards the Southern Maniac for his insulting remark.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, Jing,&#x201D; sighs Yao. &#x201C;Apparently you have agreed to go with Master Zhang here and become his new apprentice.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t agreed to anything,&#x201D; you say quickly. &#x201C;My apologies to Master Zhang, but I am afraid I really cannot go with you at the moment.&#x201D; Zhang Jue just raises his eyebrows, a cold smile on his face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Words will not work on him, Jing,&#x201D; says Master Yao. &#x201C;If you do not know Zhang Jue well, I do. He is not a man that will take his eyes off his prize. If you do not agree, he will likely kill me, and Cao&#x2019;er, and then all of the nuns here. Then, if you are still resistant, he will kill you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is so,&#x201D; nods Zhang sagely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Unfortunately, I am not so keen to hand my apprentice over to the Southern Maniac either. It is said that none of <i>his</i> disciples have survived six months under his tutelage. I will not send my apprentice off to certain death,&#x201D; says Yao, a serious look coming over his face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There appears to be a slight misunderstanding here,&#x201D; laughs Zhang Jue. &#x201C;My last disciple lasted six months and three days, setting a new record.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You see?&#x201D; says Master Yao as he gets up from his chair. &#x201C;Jing, take Cao&#x2019;er and run.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We do not care whose apprentice Xu Jing becomes,&#x201D; says the head nun, &#x201C;but all we want here is the sword.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You glance at the nuns. Perhaps if you give them the sword&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you do anything as dull as handing the sword over, I will kill you first,&#x201D; states Zhang Jue simply. The nuns glare at him, and then at you. You look around you, beginning to panic. It looks like everything is going to blow up into a messy fight in the next moment. This is all too risky. You fear that if a fight breaks out, Master Yao and Cao&#x2019;er may be injured or killed, but you do not want to go off with Zhang Jue either for the sake of your own good health. You are keenly aware that you are nowhere close to squaring your debt with Master Yao too, and are loathe to abandon him.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You give the sword to the nuns, hoping to negotiate for their assistance against Zhang Jue. With their help, it could be possible that the Southern Maniac may be forced to retreat.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do not give over the sword to the nuns. There&#x2019;s no telling whether you can convince them to help you even if you do, and making this a three-way fight may help your chances in surviving.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You do as Master Yao says and flee with Cao&#x2019;er. You have to keep her safe. This is no time to be reckless.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You stay behind to fight. You might not amount to much, but you are confident you won&#x2019;t get in the way at least. An extra hand may prove vital in turning the tide of the fight.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b> You reluctantly agree to go with Zhang Jue, attempting to negotiate your release from Master Yao&#x2019;s service so that he may leave safely with Cao&apos;er. If he agrees, you will swear an oath of personal debt towards the Killer Physician in gratitude.

            <h3>十六 · To the South</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">To the South</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will go with the Southern Maniac, master.&#x201D; You speak your words calmly and loudly, despite the confusing mix of emotions in your heart. You feel that it is a disservice to leave before you have repaid your master and Cao&#x2019;er for all they have done for you, but you would never be able to live it down if they risked their lives for your own folly.<br>
<br>
Yao turns, looking at you and through you with his wrinkled eyes. Then, he nods. &#x201C;You have made up your mind.&#x201D; It is a statement, not a question. He understands why you have come to this decision. Your master returns to his seat. &#x201C;If you are serious about this, I cannot stop you. I do not think this is the wisest choice to make, but it may well be the kindest.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You walk over to the table. The teapot is still warm &#x2013; picking it up, you refill Master Yao&#x2019;s cup. &#x201C;Please accept this last gesture from your disloyal disciple.&#x201D; With the briefest hint of hesitation in his aged hands, he takes the cup from you and drinks it with a firm nod. Then, he draws out a pale brown pill from his medicine box and tosses it to you. Catching it, you swallow the medicine. The mark on your wrist begins to fade almost instantly. You are now free from the Killer Physician.<br>
<br>
You turn to Cao&#x2019;er, forcing yourself to smile. She looks confused and shocked. Her mouth opens and closes like a fish gulping water, as she can find no words to say to you. Grabbing your sleeve, she casts her red, watery eyes downwards and begins glaring at the floor in silence. &#x201C;Cao&#x2019;er-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
With a sigh, Master Yao&#x2019;s fingers stab into the side of Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s neck. Her eyes roll back up in her head as she slumps into his arms. &#x201C;I will have some words with her. She will be in a stubborn mood for a while, but it&#x2019;ll pass. Go with your new master before he gets bored.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zhang stands up, his bulky body straightening out with a surprising grace. &#x201C;That would be a wise option, master physician. Perhaps we may call upon you some day, when he is nostalgic for his old friends.&#x201D; The Southern Maniac walks out of the room without looking back. It is clear that he expects you to follow. You see no point in dragging out the farewell any further. With a quick bow to your old master, you hurry after the new one.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Zhang Jue leads you out of the city and towards the river. At the bank you see a crude raft lashed to a rock. He stops and turns around. &#x201C;Sisters of Emei. Why do you persist in following us?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The six nuns stand a safe distance away, having tailed you from the inn in Xuzhou. &#x201C;I am afraid we must ask for that sword to be given back to us,&#x201D; says one of the nuns.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid that question has to be posed to my new master,&#x201D; you say, smiling. &#x201C;By the way, I am curious; how did you know I had it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We have been investigating its whereabouts for a long time,&#x201D; says a nun. &#x201C;It was only recently that we found out that the great grandfather of Rong Muben was responsible for its theft. We visited Songfeng Sword School recently, and Master Rong pointed to you, saying that you slew his son and took the sword. You haven&#x2019;t exactly been conspicuous in Xuzhou; you were easy to find.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Actually, both the young and old Rongs gave it to me, but that&#x2019;s besides the point. So, <i>master</i>,&#x201D; you say acidly, &#x201C;is it alright for me to return the sword now? Or does the Great Southern Maniac care so much for a fish knife?&#x201D; Now that Master Yao and Cao&#x2019;er won&#x2019;t get involved, you see no reason to hold back your tongue.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is an interesting tone you&#x2019;re taking with me, my apprentice,&#x201D; smiles Zhang Jue. &#x201C;Do you think I will not kill you for being rude?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think that you will not kill me over mere words. Judge a man by what he does, not what he says.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A lofty standard. Would that all men held such views. Unfortunately, words are in themselves deeds. They are spoken, and speaking is amongst many actions a man can do,&#x201D; laughs Zhang, challenging you to rebut him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I hate to interrupt,&#x201D; says the nun with slight trepidation and annoyance, &#x201C;but <i>can </i>we have the sword back?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing,&#x201D; says the Southern Maniac with a bored look on his face, &#x201C;draw the Yuchang Sword and fight the Emei nuns with it.&#x201D; You bite back the urge to let out a cry of &#x201C;What?&#x201D;, instead settling for, &#x201C;Yes, master.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The nun frowns. &#x201C;That would be&#x2026; inadvisable,&#x201D; she mutters. &#x201C;We do not seek bloodshed here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Neither do I,&#x201D; says Zhang. &#x201C;Defeat the boy and the sword is  yours. I am sure you can accomplish that without killing him. As for my apprentice&#x2026; well, be careful with where you point that blade.&#x201D; He winks. &#x201C;I will try not to wound anyone with a sharp sword,&#x201D; you say sarcastically as you draw the Yuchang Sword from its sheath.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is right. If you wound any of the nuns, I will inflict that wound upon you in return.&#x201D; You are not sure if the Southern Maniac is serious, but you have to assume that he is. The rest of the nuns begin stepping back, leaving their leader at the fore. As she assumes her stance, Zhang frowns.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A duel? I want all of you to attack my apprentice at once.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Zhang,&#x201D; says the nun testily, &#x201C;Emei does not gang up on a child. I alone will be enough.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you do not attack him together, I will join the fight. This is a good chance to gain the sword you so desire. Besides, he is my apprentice. Do not underestimate him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I may be your apprentice, <i>master</i>, but I have yet to learn any skills from you,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I do not think I will be able to handle all of them at once.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll see about that,&#x201D; says Zhang confidently. &#x201C;Lose and I will kill you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The nuns retreat away to confer. When they come back, they seem to have made up their minds to secure the sword today. &#x201C;We will make this quick, Xu Jing.&#x201D; They spread out, getting into formation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Guihe Formation (&#x95A8;&#x9DB4;&#x9663; ,Maiden Crane Formation), eh?&#x201D; muses Zhang. The nuns begin to surround you, as if enclosing you in the wings of a crane. As the first nun leaps to the attack, Zhang calls out, &#x201C;Two steps backwards.&#x201D; Confused at his words, you dodge the nun&#x2019;s palm strike by jumping to the left, only to run right into the clutches of two others. Redirecting your motion, they spin you about and toss you to the ground. You rapidly scramble to your feet, sword at the ready. &#x201C;One step to your right, then three steps forwards,&#x201D; calls out Zhang again. You decide to follow his instructions. You take one step to the right. A horsetail whip narrowly misses you as you do so &#x2013; surprised, you decide to press the advantage and grab the whip. Before you can do so, a nun strikes at your spine from behind, sending you sprawling to the floor again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Roll to the left before getting up, leap to the right, then take four steps backwards,&#x201D; says Zhang lazily. He&#x2019;s leaning back on the rock, looking rather bored with the whole thing. You aren&#x2019;t so stupid as to not perceive what he is doing. Casting away any misgivings you may have, you devote your body wholeheartedly into replicating the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s instructions. You roll, avoiding an outstretched hand aimed at grabbing your crotch. Stumbling to your feet, you immediately jump to the right, evading a nun&#x2019;s flying kick. You take four steps backwards the moment your feet touch the ground, barely taking the time to balance yourself. The head nun&#x2019;s leg sweep barely misses your feet.  It looks like the bastard knows what he&#x2019;s doing after all.<br>
<br>
With a snarl of irritation, the nuns continue their attack, and Zhang continues calling out his directions. You will yourself to follow his words as faithfully and as precisely as you can; the nuns&#x2019; formation is too fast and confusing for you to fight alone. As you dart, dodge, and roll around the battle, you find it easier and easier to catch their movements, but there is still no opening for you to attack. You cannot hit them, but neither can they hit you as long as you follow Zhang&#x2019;s directions.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the nuns stop, retreating back into a single line. Their old faces are scowling heavily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm, what is this? Have you gotten bored already?&#x201D; asks Zhang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We will not be training your apprentice for you, Zhang Jue,&#x201D; snaps the head nun. &#x201C;This mockery is pointless.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Southern Maniac just laughs. &#x201C;Do you not want the sword, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We have waited for years. We can wait a little longer,&#x201D; she hisses.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you do want the sword, the Abbess will know where to find me,&#x201D; says Zhang cheerfully. &#x201C;I have not changed my residence. I would suggest that you try again regularly as once we reach my island, I will not lift a finger to direct my apprentice. That would be your best chance.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Glaring at the both of you, the nuns retreat, muttering decidedly unnunly curses from their mouths.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Island?&#x201D; you ask, when they are out of sight. &#x201C;That is the place where your talent will blossom.&#x201D; Zhang Jue&#x2019;s grin is now cruel and wide, his eyes gleaming with mad glee. &#x201C;I will turn you into a peerless warrior, my apprentice.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He leaps onto the raft, laughing in anticipation. &#x201C;We head now to Yinhu Island, Xu Jing. Be prepared.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Yinhu Island is located some ways to the south &#x2013; it takes you half a month to reach the island, braving the waves along the coast. The locals call it Maniac Island; it is the home of the Southern Maniac when he is not wandering the land. The climate of the island is humid &#x2013; the greenery is more jungle than forest.<br>
<br>
Zhang&#x2019;s large house, built in the style of a mansion, is perched near a precipice. You do not know how it remains standing; it looks like it would fall at any moment. As you gaze at the sight, your new master speaks up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let us not waste any time getting started.&#x201D; His fist buries itself in your stomach. You can feel a snap as he channels his qi into you, inciting your dormant internal energy beyond the pills&#x2019; capacity to suppress. Your qi gushes forth &#x2013; this is the first time you have experienced it while conscious. It is as if a million knives are shredding you up from the inside. Forced to your knees, your numb fingers reach into your clothes, fumbling for more of your medication. You spill the pouch onto the ground as another sharp wave of pain tears through your body, causing you collapse to the muddy ground, unable to even scream from the pain.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is your nature, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Zhang Jue calmly. &#x201C;Embrace it, even as it kills you&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>

            <h3>一 · Maniac Training</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Maniac Training</span></b><br>
<br>
The first thing you were taught under Zhang Jue&#x2019;s tutelage was how to accept your chaotic inner strength. You spent seven days and seven nights writhing in pain in the jungle as Zhang Jue systematically broke down your meridians, the channels by which a person&#x2019;s qi travels.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Vessels are useless,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;All you need to do is to unshackle your qi from the narrow channels that constrain it. Your qi has transcended the need for a path. The harmony of the Way is heresy to your being. Let your strength flow freely; embrace the discord and chaos, and you will become more powerful than you can ever imagine.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Then, he added, dispassionately, &#x201C;If you survive this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You did, somehow. In the blinding pain you somehow found in yourself the will to cling on to life. By the end of it, however, streaks of white had appeared in your hair, far before your time. You had always looked slightly older than your age, but now, at merely fifteen, you could pass for a man of twenty.  The agony may have shortened your lifespan, though you do not know for sure. Without meridians it meant that any injuries you suffer to your internal system can no longer be healed by the qi of others. You would have to cope on your own.<br>
<br>
However, you gained power out of it. For the first time in your life, you were now able to use your inner strength. The Southern Maniac named it Yuanshi Hundun (&#x539F;&#x59CB;&#x6DF7;&#x6C8C;, Primordial Chaos). The orderly world was born after yin and yang came into perfect balance and harmony; before that there was nothing but dark and undifferentiated chaos.  Befitting its name, the Yuanshi Hundun coursing through your body is unpredictable and barely controllable even at the best of times. When channeled, however, it gives you a burst of strength and speed at the expense of making your strikes and movements erratic. Due to its nature, it is impossible for you to cultivate your neigong via calm meditation and docile practice.<br>
<br>
Master Zhang praised you for surviving; that lasted for all of two seconds before he set the tigers on you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Training on Yinhu Island is harsh and deadly. You often find human bones during your training; no doubt scattered remains of your master&#x2019;s former apprentices. The first part of your training was spent in the jungle that you shared with countless deadly beasts. You approached this obstacle mainly via:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Trapping. By learning to identifying the lay of the land and the tracks of the animals, you placed traps with which you could capture or kill the beasts. To do this you needed a keen eye and a mind for constructing and placing traps. (PER+1, INT+1, Traps+2)<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Stalking. You turned the jungle into your own playground, hunting the animals that hunted you without their knowledge. Your senses became keener, and your movements quicker. (PER+1, AGI+1, Sneak+2)<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Head-on assault. You contested the beasts&#x2019; territory in a show of strength. You beat them down in a direct fight, though you only managed it after downing copious amounts of alcohol. (STR+1, END+1, Drinking+2)<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>Befriending. In a stroke of rare good fortune, you somehow managed to befriend the animals. Your master was slightly amused at your approach, and proceeded to kill all of your animal friends. You were inspired to compose a great poem to lament their passing. (CHA+1, LUC+1, Artistic Skill+2)<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
After your ordeal in the jungle, during which you developed a combined qinggong skill out of your fundamental knowledge, your martial arts training began in earnest &#x2013; your regimen was strict and brutal, with no time to even sleep. You were kept awake and functional by ingestion of raw snake and bear gall bladders that Zhang ripped out. At times you wondered why the island was not yet depopulated, and then your skull was cracked open because you were not paying attention while sparring with your master.<br>
<br>
The Southern Maniac had plenty of techniques, and all of them were ones designed to kill. He was less of a swordsman, preferring to relish in flesh-to-flesh contact, though it did not mean he was not handy with a sword. Your training focused on your unarmed and sword skills, the ones you were already proficient in. The first technique he taught you were the Shouwang Claws, (&#x7378;&#x738B;&#x72C2;&#x722A;, Mad Claws of the Beast King), his signature technique. With it, Master Zhang could rend flesh from bones, dig out a man&#x2019;s heart, or tear off a limb. You do not aspire to that much, but even in your inexperienced hands the technique is lethal. Besides that, you were also taught another technique:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Fanfeng Feixue Sword (&#x53CD;&#x98A8;&#x98DB;&#x8840;&#x528D;, Counter-Wind Flying Blood Sword). Developed by Zhang Jue as an unorthodox variant of the Huashan Sect&#x2019;s renowned swift sword technique, it is meant to counter their rapid slashes with even wilder, more furious and brutal attacks of your own that would spill their blood across the arena. It has never been tested against Huashan in actual combat.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Chuzhan Fist (&#x9664;&#x65AC;&#x62F3;, Dividing Sundering  Fist). Developed by Zhang Jue as a counter to the Taiji Fist of the Wudang Sect. Zhang believes that it is possible to disrupt the gentle negation stance of Taiji, breaking their harmony by applying more force, faster than they can handle, and thus this technique focuses on ruthless, straightforward attacks that attempt to overwhelm the enemy with sheer power and speed. It has never been tested against Wudang in actual combat.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Wuni Fist (&#x4E94;&#x9006;&#x62F3;,Five Deadly Sins Fist). Developed by Zhang Jue as an answer to the famed Luohan Fist of Shaolin Temple. In response to the straightforward, direct attacks of the Arhat, the Deadly Sins movements focuses on attacking the weak points in such a straightforward technique by utilizing a variety of clutches, grabs and throws in addition to quick, jabbing strikes. It has never been tested against Shaolin in actual combat.

            <h3>二 · A Taunting Invite</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">A Taunting Invite</span></b><br>
<br>
The nuns are here again. Perched on a comfortable tree, you watch them pass under you as they venture nervously along the little dirt road that leads from the pier. You cock your head, studying them. There&#x2019;s still six of them, but one of the regulars is not present. Perhaps you should enquire over her health. After all, they are rather old.<br>
<br>
You heave yourself off the tree, dropping down lightly &#x2013; though not entirely silently &#x2013; on the path behind them. Still, they do not notice &#x2013; their footsteps are loud enough to conceal your landing.&#x201C;Hello, sisters. It&#x2019;s a pleasure to see all of you again,&#x201D; you say warmly. The entire group of nuns turn around swiftly, in a stance prepared to do violence.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing,&#x201D; says the head nun politely and coldly with a nod of her head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sister Miaozhu,&#x201D; you bow, proceeding to greet each sister by name. &#x201C;And Sister Miaoshen, Sister Miaofang, Sister Miaoqi, Sister Miaoying&#x2026; I am pleased that we meet each other in good health once more, but where is Sister Miaoli?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sister Miaoli is not well enough to make the trip this time. Her health has been poorly recently, and the Abbess deemed it time that she retired from active duty on the team,&#x201D; replies Sister Miaozhu tersely. The Emei nuns never referred to their squad as the Castration Nuns that the rest of the <i>jianghu</i> colloquially called them; to them, it was only the &#x2018;team&#x2019;. You had made the mistake of bringing that up in the third of your five encounters so far &#x2013; you had barely managed to get away with both your testicles and the sword that day.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My sincerest apologies, sister,&#x201D; you say regretfully. &#x201C;I was looking forward to challenging her variant of the Guihe Formation this time. I see that you have brought someone to take her place, though?&#x201D; You crane your head to take a look at the last nun, who is standing out of sight behind the expansive Sister Miaoshen. &#x201C;That is Sister Yifang, the newest member of our team,&#x201D; says Sister Miaozhu. &#x201C;Yifang, introduce yourself to the thief.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The nun obediently steps out in front of you, her palms placed together. You resist the urge to whistle. Your first impression is that she is wasted as a nun. Her looks would command attention in any city. Demurely, she bows to you and introduces herself. &#x201C;Good day, Master Xu. I am Yifang of the Emei Sect.&#x201C; The girl is definitely younger than you are.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing, disciple of the Southern Maniac,&#x201D; you respond.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know this might be a waste of time to ask,&#x201D; sighs Sister Miaozhu impatiently, &#x201C;but <i>can </i>we have the sword back now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201D; you say sadly. &#x201C;As you know, my master has bid me guard the blade with my life. If I give it away I will lose my head.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If that&#x2019;s the case, we can help you!&#x201D; blurts out Yifang, suddenly pleading for you to see reason. &#x201C;Emei will protect you if you return the blade to us. Please, Master Xu, let us help you.&#x201D; You glance at the older nuns. Some of them are rolling their eyes and sighing, others are snickering.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Words are wasted on his ears, Yifang. This boy is as bad as his master. Don&#x2019;t let his sweet tongue fool you,&#x201D; scolds Sister Miaofang as she scowls at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed I am,&#x201D; you laugh, stepping backwards as you draw the Yuchang Sword concealed in your sleeve. Now that the latest session is about to start, you drop all pretenses of formality and polite speech.  You know you shouldn&#x2019;t annoy them, but you just cannot resist.  &#x201C;I never thought I would see a na&#xEF;ve young nun sent along with the tough old biddies. It is as if a lone flower has blossomed in a field of weeds, its beauty made more apparent by contrast.&#x201D; Sister Yifang&#x2019;s pale, pretty ears turn red almost instantly.<br>
<br>
And with that, the nuns come after you with renewed vigor in their creaky old bones.<br>
<br>
You find yourself surrounded before you can even slip into a more heavily forested area. &#x201C;We won&#x2019;t make the mistake of allowing  you to vanish into the trees this time,&#x201D; cackles Sister Miaoshen. You grin, concentrating on their movements. The Guihe Formation is flexible and ever-changing; it is not as famous or as powerful as the Emei&#x2019;s renowned Xuannu Formation, but the Castration Nuns are specialists in this formation and and have improved it in interesting ways every time you met them despite their old stodgy looks.<br>
<br>
They come at you, in pairs and threes, breaking away and attempting to misdirect your attention. Unlike your first encounter, the Emei nuns had begun using swords against you a while back. In your hands the Yuchang Sword soars through the air; you effortlessly parry Sister Miaofang and Miaoqi&#x2019;s attacks coming at you from the left and right, knocking their swords away with your greater strength.  The dry leaves on the ground crackle behind you; instinctively you leap forward, past the two nuns, as Sister Miaoshen&#x2019;s grapple embraces only empty air.<br>
<br>
You find yourself face to face with Sister Miaozhu. The head nun has always been the most skilled of her team. Her sword  is graceful and deceptive, rooted in the Emei Swordplay known for its misdirection, while your prowess with the sword is still that of an amateur, relying on your superior strength and speed to compensate for the lack of techniques. Sometimes you think that if she were the one with the Yuchang Sword instead of you, your defenses would be skewered in a flash.<br>
<br>
You take two steps backwards &#x2013; if Sister Miaozhu pins you down now, it would be all over for your ballsack. If this part of their formation hasn&#x2019;t changed, Sister Miaoqi should be approaching you from behind, while Sister Yifang would charge in from the left. Sister Miaozhu would retreat to draw your attention straight ahead.<br>
<br>
Sister Miaozhu steps back, following the pattern. At this point, you would usually turn and attack the nun approaching you from behind, but this time you decide to try something different. Using the space granted to you, you spring forward with a powerful lunge &#x2013; the Pine-Cutting Sword. There is a slight smirk on Sister Miaozhu&#x2019;s lips as she reads your attack easily and avoids it altogether. That&#x2019;s what you guessed she&#x2019;d do. You channel your internal strength as you land. The uncontrolled energy of your Yuanshi Hundun surges throughout your body. You sway the moment your feet hit the ground, allowing your instinct to act in concert with the chaotic qi. Your swaying allows you to dodge Miaozhu&#x2019;s counterattack by a shave, and  you then turn the momentum of your evasion into a spinning backhand. Your strike hits home, knocking the nun away.<br>
<br>
As you regain your balance, you see the youngest nun flying right at you, her sword outstretched. Sister Yifang throws herself against you. You let yourself be driven back by her attacks, as she forces you out of the center of the Guihe Formation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yifang, stop!&#x201D; shouts out Sister Miaozhu.<br>
<br>
She turns slightly, distracted by her superior&#x2019;s call, and you take that chance to vanish. Crouching down low, you slip out of her vision and dart off behind a tree with a burst of speed. By the time she turns her eyes back, you&#x2019;ve circled to her side. You rush at her before the senior nuns can come to her assistance. Upon seeing you leap out of the foliage, Yifang freezes up. She closes her eyes tightly, flinching as your hand rises up to strike. With a roar, you make a claw with your fingers and swoop it downwards to pat her on the head twice and gently pluck off her skull cap. You chuckle as you leap onto a low hanging branch and use it to clamber beyond their reach.<br>
<br>
The young nun touches her shaved pate confusedly as she looks up at you twirling her skull cap in a carefree manner. When she arrives, Sister Miaozhu looks at you reproachfully, as if you are some wayward child that is too stubborn to accept instruction.<br>
<br>
A gong is heard in the distance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sorry, sisters,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re short of time today. My master is calling.&#x201D; Without waiting for a response, you disappear into the jungle that you know so well.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The Southern Maniac&#x2019;s library does not have any shelves; the books are stacked up in towers two or three times taller than the average man. In the midst of this forest of books, Zhang Jue sits, awaiting your arrival. &#x201C;It looks like you managed to get a souvenir this time, my apprentice,&#x201D; says Zhang Jue as you walk into the library. &#x201C;Truly, your perversion knows no bounds.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You did say for me to get an item off their body this time. Should I have ripped off their robes instead? It would be an interesting use for your Shouwang Claws,&#x201D; you reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was expecting you to come back with a sword or two,&#x201D; says Zhang, looking rather bored. &#x201C;How did the session go?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Guihe Formation is still too difficult for me to break in fair conditions,&#x201D; you say honestly. &#x201C;I <i>could </i>have defeated them today if I disregarded your restriction, but that was because one of their veterans had been replaced with an inexperienced girl. Still, here I am on familiar territory. On neutral ground I may not fare as well.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you feel that the restriction on killing the nuns is a burden?&#x201D; he asks.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not at all, master,&#x201D; you reply confidently. &#x201C;I agree with you. Were you not the person who said that for a killer like me, learning not to kill will improve my abilities faster?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Only because if you kill off all your toys, you will have nothing left to play with. How will you learn then?&#x201D; Zhang laughs in amusement before he changes the subject dismissively. &#x201C;Now, you seem to have been training rather hard recently, so I think you deserve a vacation.&#x201D; He pulls out a heavy-looking envelope from his tattered robes and tosses it to the floor in front of you; it makes a clattering noise.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Within you will find a wooden crest. It is an invite to the Young Tigers Martial Arts Competition that is due to be held a few months from now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Picking up the envelope, you open it. Indeed, there is a crest within, with the face of a tiger carved into the wood. You sit down, waiting patiently for Master Zhang to continue.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is jointly organized by the Eight Major Sects. You know of them from your studies. The competition is by invitation only, and limited to participants under the age of twenty. Usually, the only places receiving the invites would be the major orthodox sects, with a small number of invitations up for grabs via smaller tournaments.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who did you have to kill to get that invitation, Master Zhang? It looks like a rather orthodox competition. You shouldn&#x2019;t be anywhere on that list.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was sent here by their stupid committee. Oh, I do wish I could kill them, but I&#x2019;m afraid they&#x2019;ll just run and hide behind Taoist Wang&#x2019;s garments when they see me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, you want me to kill them instead?&#x201D;you say, half-jokingly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No. Not yet, at least,&#x201D; replies Zhang. &#x201C;I believe they sent this here because they know I have found an apprentice. They want to demonstrate that their superiority. What better way than to have the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s apprentice lose terribly in the competition?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That sounds rather petty, Master Zhang. Do they care about your reputation that much?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I suppose they are entitled to some pettiness, given the way I crippled or killed some of their seniors back in the day,&#x201D; grins Zhang fiercely.<br>
<br>
You sigh. &#x201C;I presume you are sending me to this competition?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. I do not require victory, however.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
At this, you are surprised. You would have expected that Master Zhang would have demanded you demolish the opposition at all costs. Zhang laughs again. &#x201C;Oh, that look on your face is precious. I fully expect that you are able to seize victory. I just don&#x2019;t require that you do so. As I said, this is your vacation.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is there something else you have planned, master?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very astute of you. Good. The competition is just a sideshow. The prelude to the real test I have for you. Xu Jing, I order you to go to each of the eight major orthodox sects, and challenge the best of their young disciples. I have heard stories of how this generation &#x2013; your generation &#x2013; has the potential to be the best pugilists ever seen. I expect <i>my </i>disciple to be the greatest amongst them. Do anything you have to win, to show that you are the strongest. Maim them if you have to. Kill them if you need to.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; you ponder, glossing over the incitement to murder that your master just casually threw out. &#x201C;The competition will allow me to scout out my future opponents, and make myself known to them. Is that it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. Win if you want to. You can also lose, if you want to. Hell, if you don&#x2019;t want to join, don&#x2019;t do it! Show up and mock them from the sidelines, if that entertains you. All I require of you is to complete your challenge and win <i>there</i>. You would be a severe disappointment if you fail, Xu Jing.&#x201D; You don&#x2019;t need the Southern Maniac to clarify the consequences of your failure.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How long do I have, master?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will give you a year. That should be more than sufficient,&#x201D; smiles Zhang. &#x201C;You cannot call yourself my disciple if you cannot complete such a straightforward task in a year. Prepare yourself to leave the island; you will go alone. I will keep an ear out for your exploits, my apprentice.&#x201D; Despite your misgivings, you are beginning to feel excited. This will be the first time you have set foot on the mainland in nearly a year and a half. You have been given a year to complete your challenge; that should leave you with plenty of time to adventure and finally get working on Shun&#x2019;s mission.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The martial arts tournament for fighters under twenty may be a good chance for you to mingle with your peers and find out where you stand in relation with them. However, you might not want to attract attention by going there either.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You decide to join the Young Tigers Martial Arts Competition with the invitation you have been given. The potential knowledge, contacts and benefits you may accrue from participating are too tantalizing to give up.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You decide not to join the Young Tigers Martial Arts Competition with the invitation you have been given. Given your reputation, it is too risky. You would prefer to keep a lower profile before you begin your challenges to each of the sects so that they do not know your capabilities.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Whether you join the competition or not, there is time before it starts. As Master Zhang has advised that you only begin the challenge after it concludes, you have perhaps a month or so to do as you will. You use that time to:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Travel to Yuhua Hall to investigate the woman in black that attacked you so many years ago. Perhaps you may find out something.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Track down Master Yao and Cao&#x2019;er &#x2013; you would like to find out if they are okay. They might even join up with you again.

            <h3>三 · Rumours of Qingcheng</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Rumours of Qingcheng</span></b><br>
<br>
After searching fruitlessly for a few days, you are forced to trade away a good amount of your rations to a beggar for news of Master Yao and Cao&#x2019;er; the Southern Maniac was not the type to have money lying around for your perusal. The beggar, looking slightly put off at the dried gall bladders and jerky, decided to fulfil his part of the bargain anyway. You found out that he had last been spotted heading west, to Chengdu.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The sparse vegetation rustles. You hear shouts. Men, their voices coarse and mocking. You lightly run up a nearby tree, nimbly catching onto a branch and pulling yourself up to find a vantage point. You&#x2019;ve heard from the traders that this route is infested with bandits. Perhaps this is one of those encounters.<br>
<br>
A young nun backs out of the bushes; it&#x2019;s the same rookie that you fought on Yinhu Island. She has replaced the skull cap you took from her. Three more thugs waving axes surround her, shouting and leering. The nun &#x2013; Sister Yifang, you believe she was called &#x2013; draws her sword and takes a stance. The bandits laugh at her. One of them steps forward, striking at her with the back of his axe &#x2013; it seems that they plan on taking her alive.<br>
<br>
The nun leans backwards to avoid the attack and cuts the man&#x2019;s arm smoothly in one single motion. A thick red line appears across his hairy forearm. As the bandit shouts out in pain, his comrades lash out at the nun in retaliation. Her footwork is light and agile, carrying her away from the wild strikes of the bandits with ease. However, her counterattacks only manage to scratch the bandits, doing little else. From your perch, you quickly understand the nun&#x2019;s problem. Although she is skilled for her age, she is afraid to hurt them. Her nervous slashes lack killing intent.<br>
<br>
Slowly but surely, the bandits corner the nun. She backs into the tree that you are on, finding nowhere to run.<br>
<br>
You leap off the branch without warning, landing knee-first on the face of one of the bandits.You feel his nose squash under your knee as you smash him to the ground. Rolling back to your feet, you immediately bring your heel down on the fallen man hard. There is the sound of cracking bone, though you do not bother looking at your handiwork. Instead, you take the measure of your remaining opponents. They are strong men but clearly untrained and unrefined.<br>
<br>
The first attack comes, the axe&#x2019;s head whistling through the air. Your arm sweeps out and intercepts his swing before it reaches its apex. With your left hand you dig into the man&#x2019;s inner wrist; you tighten your grasp and rip your fingers away. Blood trails along with your fingers, your claws splitting his skin and tearing his tendons at the same time. The bandit&#x2019;s hand seizes up painfully as he drops the axe. At the same time, you adopt the stance of the Chuzhan Fist. Breathing in deeply, you take a quick half step forward as you drive your vertical fist into his chest with all your might, unleashing your inner strength in an brief, explosive burst. The man is thrown backwards, crashing into a nearby tree. He flops to the ground and lies still, as leaves from the shaken tree fall all around him. When you turn around, the other bandit has turned his back to run. You crouch &#x2013; from this distance you can reach him with a single pounce.<br>
<br>
Before you can do so, a hand pulls at your sleeve. &#x201C;No, Master Xu! Don&#x2019;t do it! You must not kill and add to your bad karma!&#x201D; You shake your arm free and turn around to frown at the nun.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I did not kill them. See, they&#x2019;re still alive,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
You go over to inspect the men that you had beaten. The first one has his nose entirely squashed, and from the way the entire front of his face is slightly caved in, even if he is not dead now he will not be waking in the next few days. The other man is not moving at all, blood trickling from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth. His eyes are blank and staring, and he doesn&#x2019;t seem to be breathing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026; it was an accident,&#x201D; you say. You had spent a lot of time attacking the Southern Maniac with all of your strength, only for him to laugh it off. Evidently the bandits are not in the same league of durability as your master.<br>
<br>
The nun begins praying fervently over the bodies, chanting a sutra over and over again. You scratch your head as you look around you awkwardly. She can probably find her own way from here. Turning around, you walk off. &#x201C;Wait, Master Xu!&#x201D; The nun shouts at you breathlessly as she catches up, having finished her prayers. &#x201C;What is it now, sister?&#x201D; You look around you, searching for paths through the woods which you can take to lose her.<br>
<br>
She looks up at you with her clear dark eyes and frowns. &#x201C;Master Xu, I was praying for your sin of murder to be cleansed and forgiven. It is not polite to walk off just like that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;Thank you, sister. I will find an opportunity to repay you for your service.&#x201D; As you turn away, she calls for you to stop again. With a sigh, you whirl back to face the nun. &#x201C;What is it <i>now</i>?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The nun begins to fidget. &#x201C;Ah, it seems&#x2026; you see&#x2026; I&#x2019;m not too familiar with forests.&#x201D; So, she&#x2019;s lost. You give her a pitying look. Leaving her stranded here would be cruel. She may be a Castration Nun out for the sword and your testicles, but you don&#x2019;t really regard them as your mortal enemy. They are just doing their job after all. With a nod, you beckon at the nun to follow. Her face breaks out into a dazzling, grateful smile.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Three days after you saved the nun, you still have not managed to get rid of her. For three days and three nights she followed you, preaching Buddhist sutras in an effort to get you to abandon your evil ways. You feel like Monkey being pestered by the Xuanzang Monk. It has gotten to a point where you are half-tempted to send her off with the Yuchang Sword and face Zhang&#x2019;s punishment instead.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why are you separated from Sister Miaozhu and the rest?&#x201D; you ask. The question has been bothering you for a while &#x2013; you see no sign of the other nuns, and you doubt they could catch you in an ambush nowadays.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We were summoned back urgently by the Abbess. I am not privy to the knowledge; only Sister Miaozhu knows, but apparently it has something to do with Qingcheng. We got separated somewhere back when the bandits attacked. I don&#x2019;t think they would look for me because we were needed to hurry back to Emei. In such a situation, they would have had to obey the orders and move on without me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Such irresponsible nuns,&#x201D; you grumble.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I believe you are kind at heart, Master Xu. You would never have saved me if you weren&#x2019;t. If you repent and turn over a new leaf, I am sure you will do much good in the world,&#x201D; says Yifang very earnestly. You sigh and ask her a question before she can begin trying to convince you of the error of your ways again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am curious, sister. How old were you when you were sent to Emei?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am an orphan. I grew up in the care of the nuns,&#x201D; she replies with a smile. &#x201C;I owe all I have in my life to them and the Buddha&#x2019;s teachings.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Well, that explains part of her behaviour. Suddenly, you are reminded of one of the teachings you received back in the palace, from an old Buddhist monk. Perhaps this will work. &#x201C;Sister,&#x201D; you say sweetly and slyly, though she does not show any signs of suspecting the sudden change in your tone, &#x201C;To save a person, you must know that person. You cannot save that which you do not know, for not even the Buddha will claim to know the hearts of all men. There is sin within, but to cleanse that sin on my behalf, you have to understand that sin. This is what I have heard from a master monk, many tens of years older than us. He said, before you wish for the salvation of a person, first ask yourself this question: who is this person?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who&#x2026; is this person?&#x201D; she repeats.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is right,&#x201D; you smile. &#x201C;Who is this person that stands before you? Ponder upon that, learned sister.&#x201D; With that, you stop the conversation, leaving her to puzzle over the question. That should shut her up for a while. If she is going to Emei, that is on your way &#x2013; Emei is very close to Chengdu. You suppose you could let her tag along, loathe as you are to do so. The na&#xEF;ve girl wouldn&#x2019;t survive a day on her own, you&#x2019;re sure.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You manage to reach Chengdu in relative peace and quiet, as Yifang is preoccupied with your question. Wasting no time, you begin getting to work searching for rumours of Master Yao. Unfortunately, what you hear makes your heart sink.<br>
<br>
According to word on the street, Master Yao has been captured just a week ago after fleeing from his assassination of the head of the Qingcheng Sect, Song Jiangke. The story goes that Yao was called to heal Song of an ailment, but the mad physician decided to kill his patient instead. As far as you can tell, Cao&#x2019;er has been captured and imprisoned along with him. The new head of the sect, the previous leader&#x2019;s daughter, Song Lingshu, plans to execute Master Yao in a few days for his murder of her father.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is horrible,&#x201D; says Yifang, her hands put to her mouth. &#x201C;I know of the Killer Physician, he used to pay frequent visits to the Abbess. I didn&#x2019;t think he was the sort to do such a thing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s the sort to do such a thing,&#x201D; you say quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-I can help you, Master Xu,&#x201D; says the nun nervously. &#x201C;Emei and Qingcheng have been long-time allies because of their proximity. I might be able to get the Abbess to do something about this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think I want to be in the favour of Emei when I still hold your precious sword,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay, I will figure out something on my own.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stubbornness is one of your bad traits, Master Xu,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Help will be given to those who ask for it. That is one of the principles of Emei. If&#x2026; if you&#x2019;re unwilling to seek the sect&#x2019;s aid, I could perhaps help talk to Qingcheng for you. I know Miss Song. We were childhood friends, so I could talk to her.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why are you so keen to help me out?&#x201D; you ask suspiciously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure,&#x201D; she bites her lip. &#x201C;Is helping people a bad thing? I can&#x2019;t stand by and do nothing when someone is in trouble.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Truly, she is an earnest child that should have stayed cloistered on Mount Emei.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You do not need her help. Tonight you will head towards Mount Qingcheng, sneak into the compound by yourself and locate Master Yao and Cao&#x2019;er. You are confident enough in your abilities to do so.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will ask for her help in talking to Song Lingshu, daughter of the recently deceased. Of course, you will keep your identity a secret. You will then use that opportunity to scout the surrounding area, should negotiations fall apart and Yifang fail to convince the new head of Qingcheng.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You will request Emei&#x2019;s help in saving Master Yao. It is not too far away; if it is true that the Abbess knows the Killer Physician, perhaps she will be willing to help out. They might demand for the sword in compensation, but you will cross that bridge when you get to it.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>Since you are at Qingcheng, you might as well get started on Zhang&#x2019;s challenge to save time. You will set Master Yao and Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s freedom as your price should you win; if you lose, they get to name whatever price they wish. You will have to think of a way to force them to accept the challenge, but you are sure you can come up with something.

            <h3>四 · Shadow in the Green City</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Shadow in the Green City</span></b><br>
<br>
The cloudless sky does nothing to conceal the bright full moon. This is a night that will yield few shadows for you. You hear the sound of a small gong from inside the compound going off three times &#x2013; once slow, twice fast. It is the third watch of the night, signifying that the time is now an hour past midnight. You had been lying in wait for half a day in the woods outside Qingcheng, carefully noting whatever movements of disciples you could see while awaiting night&#x2019;s arrival. Now, it is time for you to act.<br>
<br>
Four Qingcheng disciples stand guard at the main gates, but you are not going to walk up to them. The trees grow so closely to the walls that the branches hang over them. This would never be allowed in any of the Tang fortresses; when you had travelled along for inspections with Shun, you noticed that the soldiers would clear the surrounding area of foliage to ensure full visibility. Of course, you haven&#x2019;t heard of any martial arts school being built like a fortress.<br>
<br>
You make your way from tree to tree, keeping an eye out for the tell-tale glow of lanterns carried by patrolling disciples. At this hour of the night they will be less alert, but if you are caught out in the open that will jolt them awake rather quickly. Finding a suitable branch, you run along it and take a leap, landing on the roof of one of the buildings. Pressing yourself close to the roof&#x2019;s surface, you crawl carefully into a shadowed area and survey the compound. It is far larger than you had expected. Finding the dungeon in this complex will be harder than you thought.<br>
<br>
The patrols are not too difficult to avoid; most of the disciples on patrol are slack and unfocused. It is only to be expected; many of them wear the robes of fresh students, and they are not actually expecting any intruders. They do little more than walking from point to point while conversing with each other or singing to while away the time. You dart from shadow to shadow with ease, running silently across the paved stones. Peeking through windows and scouting the buildings slowly and cautiously, it takes another two hours until you finally locate what seems to be the entrance to the dungeon. The sound of the fourth watch rings throughout the compound. In two more watches dawn will come.<br>
<br>
You make your way down the stairs. At the end of it, you find two disciples sitting around a table playing dice. There are four cells across from them; only one is occupied. You see Master Yao, dishevelled and gaunt. The closest disciple has his back to you. Cloaked in the shadows a mere arm&#x2019;s length away from the disciple, you watch quietly as he throws the dice with a cheerful yell, and then groans in disappointment. Picking up the gourd of wine by his side, he takes a swig, before passing it to his friend who proceeds to do the same. They repeat the action twice more, throwing dice and drinking wine. They seem to be holding their liquor rather well; no point waiting to see if they&#x2019;ll drink themselves under the table.<br>
<br>
You palm the satchel of laxative powder in your hand. Deftly, you drop its entire contents into the open gourd. Then, you head up and out of the dungeon to lay in wait by the entrance.<br>
<br>
As expected, it does not take long for the two disciples to abandon their post, heading for the nearest latrine with their agonized cries. You take the opportunity to slip back into the dungeon; you will have to act quickly before they stagger back here.<br>
<br>
Master Yao&#x2019;s eyes are closed; he is in meditation. You glance at the table; the keys are not here. The disciples must have brought them along when they ran out.<br>
<br>
Approaching the cell, you pull down your mask and rap the wooden bars gently.<br>
<br>
The old physician opens one eye and stares at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, you did die from the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s training after all. I suppose my sins are such that I will be haunted till the end of my days by my failures. On the bright side, the end of my days approaches fast,&#x201D; says Yao.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a ghost, master,&#x201D; you chuckle. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a while. You look older.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hmph,&#x201D; snorts Yao, &#x201C;and here I was thinking that I have finally seen a real ghost. Do you know that I have an exorcist friend, yet I have never personally met any spirits of the deceased? You disappoint me by coming back as flesh and blood, Jing.&#x201D; Despite his words, however, he is smiling faintly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wish we could have met in better conditions, master, but time is short. Where is Cao&#x2019;er?&#x201D; Her absence in the dungeon is palpable; if she is not held together with Master Yao, then your problems have just compounded.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She is being held in better conditions in the main living quarters,&#x201D; replies Yao promptly. &#x201C;Will that be harder for you to reach?&#x201D; You give it some thought. &#x201C;Perhaps. It depends on the layout, and how many people are in the main quarters.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am afraid I do not have any idea about that,&#x201D; says Yao. &#x201C;I try not to spend too much time in Qingcheng. You can see why,&#x201D; he smiles, as he raises his manacled arms.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master, what happened here?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;What went wrong with Song Jiangke?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao just sighs, stroking his beard. &#x201C;It is a long story. I had hoped that you would be here when Song finally called me back to Qingcheng, but as luck would have it, your destiny was someplace else. I would not have been caught otherwise. Very well, let me explain. It will be a rather long story.<br>
<br>
I will start at the beginning. Five years ago, before we met, I was called to heal Qingcheng&#x2019;s Song Lingshu from a terrible injury. There was a horse-riding accident, if I recall correctly. When I had finished with the treatment, I requested my price. That would be the father, Song Jiangke. Even then I could tell that he was afflicted by a fatal disease, though he did not know it yet. Song refused to pay the price. He is&#x2026; was&#x2026; an arrogant man. Throwing a bag of taels at me, he called upon his disciples to draw swords. At that time, I decided to leave. I knew that he would begin suffering from the symptoms in a few years... I knew that then he would call on me again. If he thought that he could scare me off once, he would think that he could do it a second time. And so, I bided my time and waited.<br>
<br>
When the call came, I answered. I treated his disease. I cured it, in fact, after some tremendous work. Then, I demanded his daughter&#x2019;s life. The daughter for the father, the father for the daughter. It is only fair, is it not? As I expected, Song refused to pay, even resorting to threatening me again, using the exact same tactics. I left, again. Then, I came back to assassinate the both of them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao smiles wanly. &#x201C;As you have undoubtedly heard, I only succeeded in killing one of the Songs. In the process he managed to raise the alarm and deal me a serious injury. I severely underestimated his prowess. Thanks to my quick thinking I managed to flee the compound, but they eventually tracked me back to the hut. There, Cao&#x2019;er and I were captured. Miss Song has turned out rather upset about her father&#x2019;s death. It is a pity... were you here with me, we might have succeeded in killing the both of them and escaping.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Your nails bite into your palms as you clench your fists tightly. &#x201C;Master Yao,&#x201D; you whisper angrily. &#x201C;Are you telling me you purposely put yourself and Cao&#x2019;er at risk because you wanted to take your payment in a hurry?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have waited five years,&#x201D; says Yao calmly. &#x201C;That is much more than I give most people. I will not let Qingcheng think they can push me around and treat me like their personal physician by abusing their greater strength.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But you could have waited a bit longer. There was no point in doing things so recklessly just because of your principles!&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then why are <i>you </i>here, running around Qingcheng without permission in the middle of the night? If you are caught you would put Cao&apos;er in further danger. Xu Jing, do not presume to lecture me about recklessness,&#x201D; replies Yao in that same quiet tone.  You feel as if you had been doused in icy water. With a shamed bow, you lower your head as you calm down slightly. &#x201C;I am sorry, master. I spoke out of hand.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao sighs wearily. &#x201C;I know that you are concerned over Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s safety, and mine. I have made mistakes and erred in my judgment over the many years I have lived. At my age I am well aware of my faults and my sins. I will admit as much; I killed Song Jiangke over my pride, and nothing else. I should not have done so &#x2013; I should have thought of Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s wellbeing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A price is a price, master. It had to be paid.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If that is so, will you claim the remaining price for me? Will you balance the world?&#x201D; says Yao, staring at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you order me to kill Song Lingshu, I will,&#x201D; you say quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is not an order. I am asking if you are willing to perform my duties for me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am perfectly willing to, master, but first I must get you and Cao&#x2019;er out of here. It would be foolish to assassinate her while the both of you are still in Qingcheng&#x2019;s custody.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao laughs softly. &#x201C;Your time spent with the Maniac hasn&#x2019;t left you untouched. Jing, it is impossible to get both Cao&#x2019;er and I out of here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I may seek Emei&#x2019;s help, since they have offered. Failing that, I will just return the next night to free the both of you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao&#x2019;s steady gaze wavers for just a moment. &#x201C;Emei? You have spoken to Abbess Miecao?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You shake your head. &#x201C;No, I spoke with one of their junior nuns.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao leans back, stroking his beard. &#x201C;I see. Jing, I am giving you my last request as your master. Kill Song Lingshu tonight, and bring Cao&#x2019;er with you when you leave. The former is optional, but I will beg you to do at least the latter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is your reason for asking that this be done tonight?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;Can this not wait?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Can you be sure that your infiltration will go as smoothly tomorrow? Or the day after?&#x201D; retorts Master Yao. &#x201C;You have made it this far, but there is no certainty that things will not go wrong the next time before you even step foot into the compound. No, I want you to capitalize on your current advantage and get Cao&#x2019;er out of here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;At least let me find a way to unlock your cage-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not bother,&#x201D; snaps Yao. He stretches his legs, showing you his ankles. &#x201C;They cut my tendons to stop me from using my inner strength to escape. It will take at least two more days for me to heal them. By then the Emei nuns will come for me. I will leave with them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You blink, surprised at his words. &#x201C;Are you saying that Emei will come to rescue you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you get Cao&#x2019;er out of here and keep it a secret from the nuns, they will likely rescue me instead.&#x201D; Seeing that you are about to open your mouth and ask for more information on this strange turn of events, Yao grumbles. &#x201C;I have no time to explain all of my dealings, boy! Now, will you do it, or will you not? If you are not going to rescue your senior, I will shout for help immediately.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You take a step backwards. Has the old man gone insane? &#x201C;Look, perhaps you are not thinking clearly, master. If I kill Song Lingshu and rescue Cao&#x2019;er, it is going to create a big uproar when they discover the deed tomorrow. You&#x2019;ll be lucky if they don&#x2019;t kill you outright. They might even increase the patrols. How would the nuns help you then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have a plan, but that is something for the elderly to pull off. Any reckless meddling on your part would only make things worse. It is none of <i>your</i> concern. Your main concern lies with Cao&#x2019;er. That is what I am tasking you with. I had hoped that you take care of her for life, but if you cannot do that, at least take her away from this place. Now, go. If you do not, I <i>will </i>call for help.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You pretend to agree with Master Yao, but in actuality perform a hasty retreat. He must have gone mad from imprisonment. You&apos;ll need to approach this differently.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You head towards Emei with the knowledge that you have, seeking their help now that Yao has said that they would come to aid him. They should be more willing to help you out since they&apos;re already planning to do something that seems to aid you.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>Yifang should still be in Chengdu; you will find her and ask her to take you to Song Lingshu. Perhaps you can blackmail the new head of Qingcheng or otherwise sway her position with what you&#x2019;ve learnt tonight. Sparing Master Yao from execution seems to be a hard deal to make, but you will try your best.<br>
<br>
<b>3. </b>You will perform Master Zhang&#x2019;s challenge, utilizing his reputation to force a confrontation. That seems to be a more direct and bloody way of solving things. A good fight is all you want and need.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do as Master Yao says, and proceed to the main living quarters. There you will find Cao&#x2019;er and get her out of Qingcheng, but before you do that, you may want to deal with Song Lingshu.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You will kill her, as Master Yao suggested. She would not be expecting a second assassin now that Yao and his apprentice are imprisoned. It should be trivial, particularly at this time of the night. She&#x2019;ll never see it coming.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You will sneak into her chambers and instead proceed with a mixture of intimidation and negotiation, masked anonymously. Even if she&#x2019;s the head, she&#x2019;s still a sheltered girl of your age. This way you have the psychological advantage, instead of seeking an audience with her from a position of weakness tomorrow.<br>
<br>
<b>3. </b>You ignore Song Lingshu and merely concentrate on getting Cao&#x2019;er out, not out of any fear of failure, but because you do not want to antagonize Qingcheng any more than is necessary. They will not be grateful to you for not antagonizing them since they would never know, but it&#x2019;s the thought that counts.

            <h3>五 · Cao&#039;er and Miecao</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cao&#x2019;er and Miecao</span></b><br>
<br>
The main quarters of the sect is easy to find; a brick and wood two-storey structure that lies near the center of the compound. From what Yao has said, Cao&#x2019;er should be held on the second floor. You notice that only one room is still lit. A loud, exaggerated yawn and the sound of chatter comes from your side &#x2013; there is a patrol coming. Wasting no time, you step onto the vertical pillars, using them as a foothold to reach the ledge of the second floor. You pull yourself up with ease. Holding onto the edges, you quickly move over to the window of the lit room. Staying close to the wall, you crane your neck and peer inside.<br>
<br>
There is a girl lying belly-down on the floor, apparently reading a book. You quietly pull the window open and clamber in. As your feet touch the floor, she springs up suddenly to face your intrusion, her hand blurred in a throwing movement. You feel a sharp sting &#x2013; looking down, you see two needles embedded near your pressure points. At those locations, it would cause swift paralysis&#x2026; if you still had pressure points. You pluck out the needles, pulling down the cloth mask that covers your lower face as you do so.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your throwing has improved, Cao&#x2019;er.&#x201D; you wince. You hear a strange, choking noise in her throat.<br>
<br>
She&#x2019;s grown rapidly in the year and a half since you last saw her. You didn&#x2019;t expect that short, stubby girl to grow into a lanky lass only half a head shorter than you are. Her rags, which once swaddled her almost entirely, now barely cover her knees and elbows. She appears to have added new clothes to that confusing collection of torn cloth, however, showing as islands of colour in a sea of faded tones. Her hair, however, still serves as a curtain that hides as much of her face as possible, though it appears slightly less messy and more silky nowadays.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Cao&#x2019;er?&#x201D; you ask again, as she stands there frozen, as still as a statue. Her breathing intensifies quickly as her knees give way and she sinks to the floor. You rush to her side. &#x201C;Are you okay?&#x201D; you ask, checking her pulse. She looks at you and nods wordlessly, making a gesture that indicates she needs some time to calm down.<br>
<br>
After some time, she manages to speak. The first word out of her mouth is your name. &#x201C;Jing! Why are you&#x2026;&#x201D; Her croaking has grown slightly deeper and changed in tone, giving it a more husky effect that is not as unpleasant to the ear.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m here to get you out,&#x201D; you say simply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;what about the master? He&#x2019;s in the prison&#x2026; are we going to get him out?&#x201D; She seems to have improved at speaking, thankfully.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not to worry, I&#x2019;ve spoken with him. I&#x2019;m to take you away first. That&#x2019;s an order.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;ok. We&#x2019;ll go&#x2026; just, I was worried.&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er stumbles over the words in a slight panic. You clap her shoulder twice, reassuringly. You need to flee now before your luck runs out. &#x201C;So, how good are you at running nowadays?&#x201D; you ask with a grin.  She shakes her head, looking down at the floor. &#x201C;&#x2026;not sure.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You sigh. &#x201C;Luckily, I can run for the both of us. Is there anything you need to take from this room?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She shakes her head again. Well, it&#x2019;s time to begin, then.<br>
<br>
You scoop her up in your arms &#x2013; she&#x2019;s only slightly heavier than she once was. She makes a startled look for just a second before she quickly puts her arms around your neck and clings on tightly. Stepping out onto the ledge, you look around. There are no patrols in the vicinity. You leap off the second floor. Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s extra weight causes your landing to make more sound than you would have liked, but no one appears to notice.<br>
<br>
You make your run to the edge of the compound.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a patrol appears in front of you. Without stopping you change your direction, dashing behind a nearby building. You catch your breath, backing up against the wall. You can feel Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s warm breath tickling your neck, and you shift slightly so that it won&#x2019;t disrupt your concentration.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did you guys see anything? I thought there was something ahead of us,&#x201D; says one of the disciples. You move slowly towards the other side of the building.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Must&#x2019;ve been some cat or monkey.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Looked kinda big, though, like a human.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe it&#x2019;s the Shadow Wolf. I hear he&#x2019;s been spotted in the region.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;All the way out west, here? <i>I</i> heard he was last seen in Yangzhou.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As the disciples gossip, you circle around the building, finding yourself a clear path to the wall. You&#x2019;re almost at the finish line. When you reach the wall, you give Cao&#x2019;er a boost. You use your hands as a foothold, pushing her up so that her jump reaches the top of the wall. After she has made it across, you back up a bit. Taking a running start, you manage three steps up before you leap, barely grabbing the edge of the wall with the tips of your fingers. You pull yourself up and over, landing on the other side where Cao&#x2019;er is waiting for you. The night sky is turning light as the day slowly begins its encroachment. Grabbing her hand, you make your way down the mountain, to safety.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You find a place near the outskirts of Qingcheng where you can hide out with Cao&#x2019;er. Exhausted from your exertions throughout the night, you fall asleep almost as soon as you hit the bed. When you awaken, it is already night time again. You find Cao&#x2019;er looking down at you, stroking the white streaks in your hair. &#x201C;&#x2026;you&#x2019;re slightly different now,&#x201D; she murmurs. &#x201C;...but it&#x2019;s okay. Jing is still Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m awake, you know,&#x201D; you say, laughing. Her hand jerks back suddenly as she apologizes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nothing to apologize for.&#x201D; You pat her head. It&#x2019;s a nostalgic feeling, and this time around her hair isn&#x2019;t nearly anywhere as greasy as it was before.<br>
<br>
There are things for you to do &#x2013; Master Yao had said that he would be fine, but you are not so sure. He had said that the Emei nuns would come for him. You are not certain about leaving Cao&#x2019;er alone, but she tells you that if you have things to do, she can take care of herself. You head down to Chengdu.<br>
<br>
There, you find that Yifang is no longer around; she may have returned to Emei. You do not fancy walking up to them by yourself; if you get captured for any reason they can think of, that would be bad.<br>
<br>
There are a few dozen Qingcheng disciples in the city, wandering about asking if any of them have seen a messy girl in rags. You walk into one of them, bumping your shoulder into his. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Be more careful next time,&#x201D; scowls the disciple as he massages his bruised shoulder.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m sorry. It won&#x2019;t happen the next time. By the way, sir, why are you looking for a girl?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you new in town? She is an apprentice of the Killer Physician, who murdered our old master. She somehow escaped last night.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see, I see. What will you do with her when you catch her? Will she be put to death?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s up to the mistress,&#x201D; snorts the disciple. &#x201C;Her master will be executed for his crimes in two days, though. You can come up to the public square in Qingcheng if you want to watch.&#x201D; You bow to him respectfully. &#x201C;Of course, sir. I will be there, sir.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As you make your way back to the hut, you begin thinking up plans to break out Yao should you get no news of his escape. You could strike tomorrow night, or perhaps plan something on the day of the execution itself&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The next day, you decide to begin preparations for your next move. When you leave the hut, however, you see a very strange sight.<br>
<br>
Master Yao stands in front of you, his head shaved. He is dressed in the orange robes of a monk.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;Master Yao?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My name is no longer Yao Shunshi. Call me by my Buddhist name, Fayi, kind sir,&#x201D; he intones.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you serious?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao frowns and snaps at you. &#x201C;Of course not. But I&#x2019;ll have to be this way until things settle down with Qingcheng or I die of old age, whichever comes first.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is not the way a monk should be speaking, Shunshi.&#x201D; A stern voice calls out. Looking behind Master Yao, you see an old nun carrying herself with dignity and grace. She is tall and thin, almost as tall as Yao himself &#x2013; from her features, she would have been quite the looker back in the day.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Spare me the lectures, Lihua,&#x201D; Yao grumbles.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My name is Miecao now. And sooner or later, I will be calling you Fayi. Do get used to it; after all, you promised to do so in order to be rescued,&#x201D; says the nun as she approaches you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are Xu Jing, apprentice to this old fool and disciple of the Southern Maniac, are you not?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I am. Sister Miecao&#x2026; Abbess Miecao of Emei? It is an honour that you have come all the way out here to my humble shack.&#x201D; You give the leader of Emei Sect the respect that a person of her standing deserves, bowing with your hands placed together in salute.<br>
<br>
She nods approvingly. &#x201C;At least you have learnt manners. Although I have heard from Miaozhu that your manners are merely a way for you to catch people off guard.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Her praise is too kind. I do not think I have ever caught her truly off guard,&#x201D; you say. A hint of a smile rises at the Abbess&#x2019;s lips. &#x201C;It is good that you know some restraint, and did not commit any foolish deeds at the behest of that silly old man. It could have complicated matters tremendously. Well, I suppose there are things you wish to ask me. I have some questions on my own too. Let us talk further inside the hut.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As the three of you walk into the hut, Cao&#x2019;er gives a nervous greeting. Abbess Miecao looks over the girl, and just for a brief instance the harsh look in her eyes soften. After all of you have taken your seats, she speaks.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let us first start with what will happen to Yao from now on. I have freed him from the prison without the knowledge of Qingcheng&#x2019;s Miss Song, against my better judgement. To be fair, he has taken a life and should have paid for it. Still, since I made my way there, and did not find what I was looking for...&quot; She pauses in embarrassment as Yao sniggers. It seems that he has managed to get one over the Abbess, and negotiated his own rescue. &quot;Well, though it is not the right thing for me to do, by all rights Miss Song should have handed Yao over to the collective judgement of the Eight Sects, and not act on her own whim. For now, Yao will join a nearby monastery, Shizu Temple, and live as a monk to repent for his countless sins over the years.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yao snorts loudly. &#x201C;Just because you chose to do that&#x2026;&#x201D; The Abbess glares at him until he looks away.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;When the time is right and emotions do not run as high, I will request that the elders of the Eight Sects convene to pass judgement on this matter. At that time I may request the both of you to attend as witnesses.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give her a quick nod. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll be there if we can.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very good. Now, we need to discuss the matter of Cao&#x2019;er. I will take her in. She will learn the ways of the Buddha and the teachings of Emei. There, she will be safe.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You feel Cao&#x2019;er draw closer to you, clinging onto your sleeve just like she always did. She seems reluctant. Yao laughs loudly. &#x201C;See? I told you, Lihua! She will not go with you. Being cooped up on a mountain with you nuns will just stifle her potential. She is meant to travel and learn about the world. That is the only way she can blossom.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Miecao grits her teeth. &#x201C;Shunshi, I agreed to split up the girls because <i>you </i>told me that you would keep her safe. And what did you do? You got her dragged into your own mess!&#x201D; As she argues with Yao, her speech grows coarser.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, that&#x2019;s my mistake,&#x201D; grumbles Yao, &#x201C;but there&#x2019;s no need to drag her off to the mountain because of this. Besides, you already have one to take care of.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is not the point, you horrible man,&#x201D; grimaces the Abbess. Suddenly she turns to you. &#x201C;That does remind me,&#x201D; she says bitterly, &#x201C;I do need to thank you for escorting Yifang to Chengdu safely. That girl is a real handful. She could have contacted Miaozhu after they got separated and told them to come for her, but instead she sends a message telling them she&#x2019;s with you and attempting to save you from the cycle of karma, and that she would meet them at Chengdu. I will punish that girl for her recklessness. And Miaozhu&#x2019;s team, for being too lenient on her.&#x201D; The old nun pauses for a while, before glaring at you suspiciously. &#x201C;You did not do anything ungentlemanly towards her, did you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Raising your hands, you back away. &#x201C;Of course not! Perish the thought, Abbess! Defiling a nun would be the last thing on my mind!&#x201D; Besides you, you hear Cao&#x2019;er murmur quietly, slightly sulkily, &#x201C;&#x2026;Jing is a lecher&#x2026; but it&#x2019;s okay. I don&#x2019;t mind being second&#x2026; or third.&#x201D; You suddenly remember that you have never corrected her misconception of you as a womanizer before getting dragged off by Master Zhang.<br>
<br>
Yao&#x2019;s loud laughter interrupts your thoughts.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Lihua, the boy is too confused to take this all in. Perhaps you should explain it to them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She squints at the Killer Physician. &#x201C;Can we trust him?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;d trust him with my life.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Abbess clears her throat. &#x201C;Cao&#x2019;er, I have something to tell you. You are our granddaughter. Mine and Shunshi&#x2019;s.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You eye the window. Suddenly, jumping out of it looks like a very appealing option. You have read about these plots in two-penny novels bought on the street, but you had never imagined you would encounter such a generic twist in real life.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You also have a twin sister,&#x201D; says Yao. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s a nun at Emei, by the name of Yifang.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I think it might be better if I allowed you three a happy family reunion,&#x201D; you say suddenly with an awkward laugh as you stand up. This is too much for you to take in all at once. &#x201C;I will be outside if you need me.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, you are as good as family, Jing,&#x201D; grins Yao slyly. You do not like that grin. &#x201C;I was going to betroth Cao&#x2019;er to you after all.&#x201D; The girl in question makes a strangled noise and turns entirely red, like a cat hacking up a furball.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was not told about this, Shunshi,&#x201D; says Miecao menacingly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, it&#x2019;s up to the young ones anyway. I&#x2019;m just making a suggestion,&#x201D; he cackles.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing, it is rude to leave after we have agreed to confide in you. Sit down,&#x201D; says the Abbess coldly. You do so dutifully. She may not be one of the Five Great Pugilists, but her reputation is mentioned in the same breath. You can tell that she has the power to back up her leadership of one of the most powerful of the Eight Major Sects. With a great sigh, you resign yourself to their exposition, though it is told more for Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s benefit than yours.<br>
<br>
It is a simple story.<br>
<br>
When the Abbess was young, she was a powerful bandit queen and an adventuress. One day, her gang turned on her, betraying her as such scum are wont to do when they sense weakness. A young Yao, fresh from his studies, found her injured in the woods. He nursed her to health, and they inevitably fell in love.<br>
<br>
At this part you had to stop them and beg politely that they skip the courting scenes.<br>
<br>
Soon afterwards, the Abbess, then known as Lihua, became pregnant. They had a child, a daughter. However, Lihua&#x2019;s past sins caught up to her. With the authorities and her enemies suddenly after her, they decided they had no choice but to send the child away for fostering. After an argument in which swords were drawn, Lihua became a nun to repent for her misdeeds, taking on the Buddhist name of Miecao. A bitter Yao, on the other hand, went on to cultivate his reputation as the Killer Physician.<br>
<br>
They continued to keep a careful watch over their daughter whenever they could, however. She grew up, fell in love with a man of her own, a pugilist from a long family of pugilists, and eventually married him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alright, could we stop?&#x201D; you ask wearily. Yao snorts. &#x201C;What, have you no patience?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No,&#x201D; you sigh. &#x201C;I just know where this is going. Your daughter gives birth to two girls, Cao&#x2019;er and Yifang. Something happens to her and her husband; presumably killed or otherwise indisposed. Then, master, you picked up the girls and brought them to the Abbess. You decided to share guardianship of the children. Master, you recognized Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s potential, and took her with you. And so now here we are. Am I right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The boy is smart,&#x201D; murmurs Yao, impressed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I&#x2019;ve just read many books with a similar storyline before,&#x201D; you groan, rubbing your temples. &#x201C;I just can&#x2019;t believe&#x2026; look, am I being messed with?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you saying our life experiences are a joke to you?&#x201D; says the Abbess. Her eyes are sharp enough to dig a hole in your heart. You shake your head quickly. &#x201C;No, of course not. Please continue.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is not much left to say.&#x201D; Miecao looks at Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;I just want her to know, so that she will come with her grandmother to Emei where I will keep her safe. Her useless grandfather here will be kept in a monastery for a while, so there is nowhere else for her to go anyway.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need for that,&#x201D; says Yao quickly. &#x201C;Jing can keep her safe, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You cannot expect me to trust Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She just isn&#x2019;t suited for life in a convent-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
As the two old people begin to argue, you look at Cao&#x2019;er. She seems to be considering everything they have just said and revealed. Her face is furrowed, deep in thought; you cannot tell what she is thinking. &#x201C;Well? Jing, what do you say?&#x201D; asks Yao suddenly. &quot;I think Cao&apos;er will be more likely to listen to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
You look at the Killer Physician and the Abbess of Emei.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Cao&#x2019;er should go to Emei. She will be safer there than she is with you on the road; this is the only consideration you should think of.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Cao&#x2019;er should come with you. You will look out for each other, and you cannot see her being comfortable with the nuns, to be honest.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You let Cao&#x2019;er decide. It&#x2019;s her life after all &#x2013; what you should do is support her decision the best you can.

            <h3>六 · To the Tournament</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">To the Tournament</span></b><br>
<br>
You decide to allow Cao&#x2019;er to give her own opinion about the matter. With a gentle shove, you push her to the front, encouraging her to say what she wants. She nods at you gratefully.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;...I want to see the world like Grandfather says&#x2026;&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er. Yao gives a loud, satisfied &#x201C;Hah!&#x201D;.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;but I also want to see what it&#x2019;s like at Emei with Grandmother&#x2026;&#x201D; she continues. Miecao grins at Yao triumphantly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;but I don&#x2019;t want to be a nun, because&#x2026;&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er says, giving you a shy glance.<br>
<br>
The Abbess frowns at her granddaughter. &#x201C;What is it that you want, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;can I just stay at Emei for a while? I have things I want to learn from you, Grandmother, but there are also things I can learn by wandering the <i>jianghu</i>&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The girl makes sense. She would be safer if she could learn Emei techniques for women in addition to the skills I have already taught her. Can we do anything about her request, Lihua?&#x201D; Yao asks. Abbess Miecao just sighs, casting him a reproachful eye. &#x201C;I blame you for this, Shunshi. Well, I suppose I shouldn&#x2019;t judge too much. After all, Cao&#x2019;er would never have been born if I wasn&#x2019;t something of a adventuress myself. I would be a hypocrite to say that there wasn&#x2019;t a certain charm to being unburdened by duties and obligations.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You could always retire and run away with me,&#x201D; says Yao with a chuckle.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The problem with you is that you are <i>too </i>free,&#x201D; snaps the Abbess, smiling despite herself. &#x201C;I swear, you used to be the level-headed one who had to hold me back! Anyway, Cao&#x2019;er?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;yes!&#x201D; The girl goes rigid as she looks at her grandparents nervously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I could take you in as a guest of Emei. It is not an uncommon practice for the convent, but what we can impart to you will be limited. There are many techniques that we only teach to the nuns. Perhaps in time you may find you like life at Emei, and join us officially. At that time you need only ask. Is this alright?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;yes!&#x201D; goes Cao&#x2019;er again. Then, she looks at me. &#x201C;&#x2026; could I ask you a favour, Jing?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Since you&#x2019;re being uncharacteristically chatty today, go ahead,&#x201D; you smile.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Would you be willing to journey with me? Not today, no&#x2026; perhaps in three months or so? It should not take me that long to learn what I need&#x2026; I think?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Abbess looks scandalized that Cao&#x2019;er thinks that she will be able to master what she has to teach in three months. Yao only laughs confidently. &#x201C;She is a fast learner, Lihua. In her fifteen years of life she has learnt what it took me more than fifty years to know.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t promise you that,&#x201D; you say honestly. &#x201C;I might be somewhere I cannot leave, or I might be crippled or dead by that time. My journey isn&#x2019;t a safe one. But I promise you that if I am able, I will come to Emei in three months&#x2019; time. If you still want to leave with me then, I will bring you along.&#x201D; Besides, you do plan to visit the mountain anyway. You&#x2019;ll just have to schedule it ahead of some of the other sects.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;that is fine.&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er makes a satisfied sigh. &#x201C;&#x2026;if you don&#x2019;t appear, I&#x2019;ll come find you&#x2026;&#x201D; A slight chill runs down your back, but you do not know why.<br>
<br>
And with that, the issue is settled.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose this is where we part ways, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says the Abbess as the four of you leave the hut. Yao takes Cao&#x2019;er aside and begins giving her some last instructions. &#x201C;I will be bringing Shunshi and Cao&#x2019;er with me to settle them down. There are many preparations I need to make before heading to Luoyang for the Young Tigers Martial Arts Tournament, so I will need to take my leave now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The tournament, eh?&#x201D; you respond absent-mindedly before realizing what you just blurted out. Miecao looks at you with slight surprise. &#x201C;Are you going too? Did you win one of the qualifying competitions for a crest? I suppose Zhang Jue would like to show off his disciple once in a while&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look back at her, deciding whether or not to lie. Still, it is strange that she would assume you had won one of the competitions, instead of using the crest that had been sent to you. You decide to tell the truth about your invite and trust her. After all, they did confide in you about Cao&#x2019;er and Yifang&#x2019;s true identities. If news gets out that the Abbess of Emei is raising her granddaughters on the mountain, it would be a great scandal for the sect; she would be seen as partial and unfit to lead. Besides, even if you didn&#x2019;t tell her the truth now, she would definitely recognize you during the tournament. You doubt you could hide from the Abbess.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Actually, Master Zhang received an invite from the committee.&#x201D; You take out the crest and letter, handing it over to her. If Miecao doesn&#x2019;t know, it could be a fake. Better to get her to check it here, lest it turn out to be some form of trap. &#x201C;Is it the real thing?&#x201D; you ask. She looks at it, turning it over with her thin fingers.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It does not appear to be an imitation. The seal on the letter is also genuine. I doubt it is forged,&#x201D; she concludes. &#x201C;None of the leaders of the sect are on the committee, and we do not decide who to invite. They are made up of senior disciples from all Eight Sects. Still, they had not told us of their intentions to invite the disciple of the Southern Maniac. This is not usual.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Abbess hands it back to you. &#x201C;I will not tell you if you should participate or not. That is entirely your choice. If you do, however, be careful about it. Luoyang is under our protection, and besides me, Grand Taoist Zhengchong of Wudang, Abbot Fangzhang of Shaolin and Taoist Cuishan of Kunlun will be there. I dare say that you should be safe, but there are no certainties in life. As a contestant we are obliged to protect you, but as the Maniac&#x2019;s apprentice there will be those that hate and fear you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is a given,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;My master does not have the best of reputations.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed, he doesn&#x2019;t. He is a brutal and savage man, and has killed many fighters &#x2013; he deserves the reputation he has. You are not a na&#xEF;ve boy, so I will not order you around like one of my nuns, or preach to you like silly Yifang did. But still, a grandmother must look out for her granddaughter, even if it is not proper thoughts for a nun to hold. So, boy, take care of yourself. If anything happens to you my granddaughter will be sad, foolish girl that she is.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give her a respectful bow, grateful for her advice. It changes little; you have always known that the tournament would carry some risk. &#x201C;Thank you, Abbess Miecao. I will take your words to heart. If I may, could I ask that you keep my identity a secret to those who do not know it, should you see me in Luoyang? I would prefer to introduce myself on my own terms.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not worry. I am a nun, not a gossip.&#x201D; There is a twinkle in her eye. &#x201C;Now, about the Yuchang Sword&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You rub your bruises on the caravan, having hitched a ride to Chang&#x2019;an from Chengdu. Before you had parted ways with Yao&#x2019;s family, the Abbess had made you fight her. It did not take you long to realize the gap in power between you and the masters of the Eight Sects &#x2013; with her graceful and intelligent movements, the Abbess had replicated the six-man Guihe Formation just by herself. According to her, this was possible against a lone enemy for a true master, and in a duel it would appear to the opponent as if he was fighting six people at once. You ended up not being able to land a single hit, while she gave you some rather punishing smacks with her horsewhip.<br>
<br>
You came close, however, desperately performing a move that broke the Guihe Formation. Even then, in your hastiness you ended up landing head first as Miecao countered with ease. The Abbess had stopped the duel with a nod of approval while you were still groaning on the ground. She left you with the words, &#x201C;A fish hiding in water is closer than it looks,&#x201D; asking you to reflect upon that and the final move you executed that had almost hit her. That is something you plan to analyse and practice when you have time. She had let you leave with the sword, stating slyly that it will give Sister Miaozhu and her team something to do in their old age &#x2013; it&#x2019;s the most excitement they have had in years.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, Yao had gave you some tattered notes as a parting gift. It was a brief collection of notes from when he was younger; nothing too advanced, but still enlightening &#x2013; they were still writings of the Killer Physician. The notes were mainly regarding acupuncture, with a slight sprinkling of herbalism. You would be able to improve your medical skills further if you studied this. He told you to keep your chin up and remember that craftiness will get you out of more trouble than relying on brute strength.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er gave you nothing but a great big hug, causing Abbess Miecao to frown with great displeasure.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You can only watch the Imperial Palace from afar in Chang&#x2019;an. You wonder if Shun is there. You have heard troubling rumours when you reached the capital; apparently the army has been sent out to pacify the northwest border. You were sure that your visit to the Ashina was to prevent anything like this from happening. Still, you had no time to linger in Chang&#x2019;an to find out more &#x2013; you had to catch the next boat down the Grand Canal to reach Luoyang in time for the tournament. Unfortunately the caravan had overturned halfway, forcing you to hike the remainder of the journey. At least there were no bandits this time.<br>
<br>
You have time to visit one of the Imperial retreats on the outskirts of the city before you left, however. Once upon a time, Shun and you would come here every year. In the absence of the Imperial family, the place is lightly guarded. Even in the day-time you found it easy to sneak over the walls. You make your way to the back of a familiar old building.<br>
<br>
As expected, you find Shun&#x2019;s messages carved into a wooden pillar in your mutual secret code. You have been away for more than two years now, going on three. There were two messages, one for each year he visited.<br>
<br>
After translation, the first one read that everything was fine at the palace, and that he hoped you were fine too. Choosing to wander off was a choice that worried him, as he would not know how you ended up. He carved this as a means to settle his mind as he can only hope you would come across it some day. He regretted agreeing to let you run off instead of insisting you go to a proper, safe school.<br>
<br>
The second one read almost the same, though he added that he had heard some vague rumours of a person with your name from some wandering pugilists. He hoped that it was truly you, though he dared not wish for too much lest your jinx is doubled. The message is rather weathered, so you expect that Shun will come here soon to carve his third.<br>
<br>
Taking out your dagger, you leave a reply in code.<br>
<br>
<i>Your faithful servant is still alive. When we meet again, I&#x2019;ll kick your ass with all my powerful techniques for being such a worrywart and not having faith in me. </i><br>
<br>
That is the last thing you had to do in Chang&#x2019;an. Your next stop is Luoyang, and the Young Tigers Martial Arts Tournament.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
On your journey to Luoyang, you choose to practice or learn some non-combat skills that you are not particularly good at. You only have time to practice two.<br>
<br>
<b>I. </b>Artistic skill<br>
<br>
<b>II. </b>Sleight of hand<br>
<br>
<b>III. </b>Traps<br>
<br>
<b>IV. </b>Drinking<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You have dyed your hair black, and also coated the Yuchang Sword in paint to obscure its identity, following Miecao&#x2019;s advice. Registering for the tournament aside, there is still the matter of how you want to present yourself while in the city&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You do not hide your identity. There is no need to. Revealing yourself will more easily lure out those that mean to do you harm, if they exist. Besides, it is easier to let them have the false impression that you are arrogant like your Master, rather than give them the idea that you are sly and cautious when they inevitably find out about your presence here.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You conceal your identity when about town, taking on the persona of a young merchant&#x2019;s son interested in martial arts. Better safe than sorry; you prefer to put as many layers between yourself and any lurking elements in the competition if possible.<br>
<br>
(These choices have no bearing on the registration for the tournament itself, just how you go about the city. You can still sneak about at night to spy or steal calling yourself the Real Shadow Wolf or something. Besides you can always pretend to be someone hired to pretend that he is the disciple of the Southern Maniac who is pretending not to be said disciple, if that is how you fancy things.)

            <h3>七 · Luoyang City</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Luoyang City</span></b><br>
<br>
Luoyang is one of the largest cities in the lands ruled by the great Tang, and has been a capital for the countless dynasties that preceded it. You had been here only once or twice before &#x2013; along with Chang&#x2019;an, Hangzhou and Yangzhou, it was one of the few cities that could boast of more than a million citizens living within and around its walls.<br>
<br>
You arrive by boat, travelling along the Grand Canal, the great project of the Sui Dynasty that linked Chang&#x2019;an to Beijing in the northeast and also flowed down south, connecting to Yangzhou and Hangzhou. The city appears to be in a lively mood due to the upcoming tournament. Pugilists from all over the land throng the streets, publicly carrying weapons without fear. The city&#x2019;s guard are an insignificant presence. They could not be counted upon to keep the peace; order was maintained by the mere word of the Eight Sects, such was their influence.<br>
<br>
And all this, in the second largest capital of the Empire.<br>
<br>
The classics had taught you that order was established by mandate from Heaven, and that the Emperor of the day was the only figure in the entire world that has received that mandate. Although the Eight Sects paid homage to His Imperial Majesty&#x2019;s rule, you get the feeling that it may not be more than lip service. You begin to understand why Shun had been concerned about the pugilists. Though, to be fair, from your observations thus far the government has been rather ineffectual in establishing any semblance of order far from the cities &#x2013; the central officials only cared if taxes were paid and grain was collected. At least the orthodox sects protected the communities close to them from bandits and other miscreants.<br>
<br>
You are not here today to write a political treatise, however.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hello, dear innkeeper,&#x201D; you bow slightly obsequiously. &#x201C;Would you have a room available? I have been asking all along the street and it seems that I just haven&#x2019;t had any luck.&#x201D; Due to the tournament, every single inn in the city appears to be packed full of visitors. You had visited nearly twenty six establishments, and none of them had any room for you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sorry, son,&#x201D; smiles the proprietor. &#x201C;No luck for you here either. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll be finding any rooms at this time of the month, not with the competition about to start.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give him a polite nod and back out of the inn. If you had arrived earlier things could be different, but that unfortunate caravan accident had been a source of major delay. You just might have to spend the nights in some back street somewhere, where the vagrants and beggars slept. Alternatively you could look for cheaper lodgings near the brothels, where the uptight orthodox sects may be less keen to travel. As you head down the street, trying to keep an eye out for any inn around, you spot a group of young nuns coming towards you, dressed in the costume of Emei. The heavens just won&#x2019;t give you a break.<br>
<br>
The preachy nun is with them. There is also another girl, with long hair unlike the nuns, looking as striking as her sister now that she&#x2019;s been forced to clean up. And to think you had just parted ways two weeks ago.<br>
<br>
You dart into the nearest alley, almost tripping over a drunk beggar as you do so. With a quick word of apology, you wait within the shadows as Cao&#x2019;er and Yifang pass by. Cao&#x2019;er, at least, seems to be looking around for something - or someone &#x2013; as her eyes keep darting around shyly as if hoping for some rendezvous of destiny. You did tell the Abbess that you might be here before you left the girl.<br>
<br>
You shrink back even more, knowing how good her eyesight is. Then, you hear someone behind you whisper in a sultry, low voice, &#x201C;Master Xu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You whip around instinctively, prepared to strike. How could you not have noticed her presence?<br>
<br>
A pretty girl dressed in a Miao outfit backs away with her hands put up, smiling sweetly. &#x201C;Ah, I knew it was you. It has been a long time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The heavens <i>truly </i>won&#x2019;t give you a break. Running away from her would just make things worse.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do I know you, miss?&#x201D; You force a grin onto your face as you confront Chi Qilin yet again. Her hair is tied innocently into two braids this time around, doing nothing to offset her mischievous eyes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, that is how it is!&#x201D; she giggles, her bracelets tinkling. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, I must have gotten the wrong person. I thought you were an old friend of mine. He was a rather memorable person.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This old friend of yours must be a rather dashing fellow, if you are in the habit of sneaking up on him like a lover.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, he is dashing, all right. Probably dashed his head against the wall as a child.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A blockhead like that would never in his life gain fellowship of an esteemed scholars&#x2019; institution. What a pity, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She laughs. &#x201C;I agree. My old friend is <i>definitely</i> a blockhead. You do not appear to be one, so you cannot be him. So, how do I address you then, the one who seems to look like an old friend of mine, but is actually a stranger?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am Guan Shide, son of the merchant Guan Meng, recently come from Chang&#x2019;an. It is a pleasure to meet you. How may I have the honour of addressing you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, you may call me Mistress Chi, merchant&#x2019;s son. I presume you are here to participate in the tournament?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps. My father managed to procure an invite for me, and he thought it would do me some good to experience this event. What is your story, Mistress Chi?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The same, actually. My father decided this would be a good test of my abilities since I disappointed him in a previous test,&#x201D; she shrugs. &#x201C;So, I&#x2019;ve actually been following you from inn to inn for a while now. Having trouble finding a place to stay?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It seems that though you know a lot about hiding and sneaking in the wilderness, being able to detect someone tracking you in a crowded city is another matter. You will have to improve on that aspect starting from today &#x2013; it would be good to take advantage of Luoyang&#x2019;s crowdedness.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, there does not seem to be many places left,&#x201D; you reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Coincidentally, I have a spare room. My uncle was to come with me, but urgent matters of business dictated that he give this tournament a miss at the last minute. It is already paid for and the stupid innkeeper said he would take the room back but not refund it, so I decided to leave it as it is.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She smiles slyly. &#x201C;You definitely wouldn&#x2019;t be interested in that room, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course. There is no such thing as a free lunch,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My family&#x2019;s first motto is, &#x2018;profit determines allies&#x2019;. We don&#x2019;t do anything for free, and everyone knows it. Money will do fine.&#x201D; She peers at you. &#x201C;You are a rich merchant&#x2019;s son, are you not?&#x201D; You have made some money on your way here from dispensing herbs and selling cheap medicines, so you were not exactly impoverished.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would prefer searching on my own for a little while longer, Mistress Chi,&#x201D; you say. You would like to stay away from her if you could. Who knows what manner of snakes she has hidden in the room as a pleasant surprise for you? Though truth be told, snake gall bladders have proven to be good for your inner strength, and you are running low on stock&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Suit yourself. I&#x2019;m at the Tanxiang Inn. You&#x2019;ll know where to find me,&#x201D; she smiles.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
After your unfortunate encounter with Chi Qilin, you proceed to the red lantern district. While searching for a place to stay, you pass by a group of extremely confused and uncomfortable young Shaolin monks who seem to have wandered in and gotten lost in the maze of narrow streets and waving courtesans.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You help them find a way out. Their predicament might be funny, but you are not without sympathy.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You ignore them. You do not want to interact with anyone more than is necessary.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
In the end, even the cheap inns near the brothels are full. It looks like your options are between the street, or seeking out Chi Qilin.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You stay in the street, bunking down with the homeless. You are sure to begin to stink, but you would prefer to tough it out on your own, and it still affords you some measure of anonymity. It should not be harsher than living in the jungle. On the downside, your attempted disguise as a merchant&#x2019;s son would have to be changed to a wandering vagrant boy while hoping no one in the city recognizes you asking after inns. No son of a merchant would slum with the homeless.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You rent the room from Chi Qilin. She definitely knows who you are, and it might be more pragmatic to work with her on this where you can keep an eye on her, rather than allow her to cook up tricks behind your back. She is no orthodox pugilist, that much you are sure from the way she does not declare her affiliation like any good orthodox disciple would do. Besides, you might be able to pick up some tips from her about sneaking around a city.

            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Registration</span></b><br>
<br>
Sucking up your pride, you head over to meet Qilin at the Tanxiang Inn. It is a reputable place, not too expensive and not too cheap; the sort of lodgings that do not attract much attention. The inn is packed with pugilists, drinking and revelling in the main hall. The two of you make your way up the stairs, where you find that your rooms are opposite each other.<br>
<br>
You endure her smugness when passing over your money. At the price she charges, at the end of the tournament you would have barely anything left. &#x201C;A pleasure doing business with you, Young Master Guan,&#x201D; she smiles. She opens the door to your room. As you step forward, her arm shoots out, barring your way. &#x201C;Hold on. I need to disable the traps,&#x201D; she says with a serious face. You raise an eyebrow and step back, allowing her to do so. She checks the corners of the door frame carefully and removes several strings. Then, she heads further into the room and starts poking around the table and the bed. After a few minutes, she nods in satisfaction and beckons you in.<br>
<br>
Slightly wary, you enter the room.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be nervous,&#x201D; laughs Qilin. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a customer now. I don&#x2019;t kill my customers. It&#x2019;d be bad for my reputation.&#x201D; She skips over to the door and closes it shut before slowly turning to face you. &#x201C;Now that we&#x2019;re alone, Xu Jing, tell me your true reason for being here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m here to compete,&#x201D; you say flatly. &#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you worried about having your competition stay across from you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who said I was competing with you?&#x201D; Her eyes twinkle. &#x201C;You do have an inkling about where I&#x2019;m from, right?&#x201D; You nod. &#x201C;Guizhou is the base of the Wudu Cult. Is your father the Scarlet Scorpion and sub-leader of the Cult, Chi Tianxie?&#x201D; Qilin grins widely. &#x201C;It looks like you&#x2019;ve been doing some studying. Where did you find that out?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You had heard Master Zhang mention the Scarlet Scorpion in passing once, and immediately made the connection. &#x201C;Oh, I keep an ear out for people who might want to poison me in the street.&#x201D;  Qilin pouts. &#x201C;It was just that one time! Anyway, if you know that much, you should know that winning an orthodox tournament is rather low on the list of priorities for a respected member of the cult like I am.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, so it&#x2019;s <i>that</i>, then?&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course it&#x2019;s <i>that</i>. This is a good place for a practical test, with so many different experts running around. The competitors will be a good sample for my experiment on how different poisons interact with different types of inner strength.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You clear your throat. &#x201C;I hope it&#x2019;s not of the&#x2026; lethal variety?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin looks offended, her nostrils flaring in a snort. &#x201C;Please, do you think I would do something like that for a test? It&#x2019;s a waste of good poison. A smart girl like me can extrapolate the effects of a poison based on its mildest symptoms and the dosage I used. It won&#x2019;t even affect their performance at all. I am an <i>expert</i>, you know.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You do know I could just go to the committee and tell them everything you just told me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can try,&#x201D; smiles the girl sweetly. &#x201C;Do you know the second motto of the Wudu Cult?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The first one was that profit determines your allies, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is correct. The second is this: &#x2018;Anyone who crosses us will die gruesomely&#x2019;. The Wudu Cult has never failed to make good on that promise. We are masters of poison. I dare say that our training allows us to infiltrate anyplace in the world. Perhaps not overnight, but we can always get our eyes and ears and fingers where they are needed, given time. The only thing stopping us from poisoning, say, the Emperor, or the heads of all the Eight Sects, is because there is no profit in it for us. Everyone knows that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Which means you <i>would </i>do it If there was a profit.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps, but I doubt it. My father says that the balance of things as they are right now benefits the cult perfectly, and there should be no need to break it. In that case I don&#x2019;t think there is any price high enough to entice us to do such a thing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But it would be rather easy to get me poisoned for ratting you out?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, yes. But don&#x2019;t worry about it, I&#x2019;m only sharing the information so that you don&#x2019;t start suspecting your landlady of dubious practices and try to interfere under some misguided assumptions. If you&#x2019;re staying across from me, I am sure you will have the urge to peek,&#x201D; grins Qilin impishly. &#x201C;Anyway, if you don&#x2019;t interfere with my purpose here, I won&#x2019;t interfere with yours. You just want to compete, right? Let me know and I won&#x2019;t do a little test on the person you&#x2019;re up against&#x2026; or perhaps I will, if you&#x2019;re looking for that little edge.&#x201D; She winks at you, though you just sigh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I hope you know what you&#x2019;re doing,&#x201D; you say, scratching your head. &#x201C;It would be rather bad luck if you miscalculated your work&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin scowls at you. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t jinx it. I&#x2019;m being <i>very </i>careful with the dosage already.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After an exchange of insults, the conversation veers into skills and the two of you end up spending a bit more time exchanging pointers &#x2013; she can be charming enough as it is, but you have the advantage in noble etiquette, while you are a good sneak in deserted areas, but require more knowledge about how to blend into a crowd and make your way around the packed structures of a city.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The registration for the tournament begins the next day. Surprisingly, your sleep was uninterrupted by any snakes, spiders, scorpions, centipedes or toads. You leave early, without encountering Qilin. Making your way to the registration area, you see that it is already crowded with young pugilists and their caretakers. The age of contestants seems to range from about fourteen to twenty. With your dyed hair you could almost pass for your age; without it you would probably look just shy of twenty.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Young Master Guan! What a pleasure to see you here!&#x201D; shouts out a monk as he hurries over. He bows at you with his palms placed together and you return the gesture. The monk is Xuzhan; you had helped him and his friends exit the maze of brothels and gambling dens yesterday. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know you were participating!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps. I am not sure if I will. My meagre skill at martial arts managed to win a crest, and convince my father to let me come, but looking at the level of competition here I am afraid I will not be able to get anywhere,&#x201D; you say nervously. In truth, what you have seen so far does not impress you one bit. The monk smiles and nods. &#x201C;Yes, it is a rather tough crowd this year. They are saying this will be the most tightly fought competition in ages. We have the disciple of the Sword Saint Shangguan Chuji, the Twin Flowers of Huashan and Taishan&#x2019;s Seven Heroic Youths, amongst so many other notable contestants!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give him a bemused stare. &#x201C;My friend, you seem rather knowledgeable and excited about this for a monk. I thought you were not to be concerned with secular affairs?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xuzhan blushes slightly, stammering. &#x201C;W-well, I happen to be very interested in matters of the <i>jianghu</i>. Keep it a secret from my superiors, Young Master Guan. But how can one walk the path of a pugilist and not take an interest in who are the best fighters?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose you know who <i>are </i>the best fighters, then?&#x201D; you ask leadingly.<br>
<br>
Xuzhan begins racking his head. &#x201C;Well, there is some dispute as to which pugilists are the best. Ask ten different people and you will get ten different answers, but I think everyone here will have their own opinion on who is the best. It is common knowledge. But of course, you wouldn&#x2019;t know, Young Master Guan. Sorry. I forget that you are rather new to all this.&#x201D; He bows deeply in apology, hoping that he hasn&#x2019;t caused you offense.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is alright. I would love to learn more about the front-runners, if you will be so gracious as to share with me what you know.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xuzhan proves to be rather talkative. Soon he drags in some of his Shaolin friends, who in turn drag in friends from other sects, and they begin debating who is the best and why. You stand aside quietly, listening to what they have to say.<br>
<br>
By the end of it, you surmise that there are a few names to look out for at the competition, young pugilists who have made their names by performing great deeds despite their youth.<br>
<br>
Taishan&#x2019;s Seven Heroic Youths, said to be the best young fighters of the school. You do not remember their names, as they tend to be referred to as a group. Even the monks do not recall their names.<br>
<br>
The Twin Flowers of Huashan; Nie Mudan and Nie Shuixian, who are adopted daughters of the sect leader Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi, the disciple of the man said to be the best swordsman in the world, Shangguan Chuji.<br>
<br>
Su Liaojing of Kunlun, a youth that is said to have the potential to become the next head of the sect.<br>
<br>
The Three Brothers of Wudang, Wu Jin, Wu Yin and Wu Tong, are seen as a major force in the competition.<br>
<br>
Of Emei, they think the nun Yiling will prove to be an obstacle &#x2013; she had a close run for champion the last year. When the conversation turns to Shaolin, Xuzhan says embarrassedly that he is considered one of the front-runners for his temple, along with his brothers-in-monkhood, Xuzheng and Xuzhu.<br>
<br>
The Beggars have sent a few representatives, but there does not seem to be any fighters of renown amongst them.<br>
<br>
There are a few other strange competitors, including someone in a tiger&#x2019;s mask who put himself down as Nameless, but no one expects anything from these weirdos &#x2013; they appear every year and disappear just as quickly.<br>
<br>
From the hectic discussion, you also gather that they would treat all of the competitors just named as more or less equals in the pugilistic arts, though arguments can be made for each competitor for superiority in certain aspects. This year is also seen as a tight competition for another reason. For the past seven years, the tournament has been dominated by Bai Jiutian of Huashan &#x2013; a peerless, elegant pugilist whose skill has brought him victory match after match. This year he is ineligible to participate due to his age, though he is still widely considered the best pugilist of your generation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then,&#x201D; Xuzhan begins with a hushed whisper, &#x201C;they say that the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s disciple is participating this year. No one knows who he is, or if he is even here, but everyone is nervous.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How do you know he&#x2019;s participating?&#x201D; you ask. Abbess Miecao hadn&#x2019;t known of the invitation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just some rumours circulating amongst us young people. I&#x2019;m not sure where it started, but everyone believes it by now. They say he was sent a special invitation to come and showcase his prowess.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you believe it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe. I mean, people are already pointing at newcomers as possibly being the Young Maniac in disguise, since he hasn&#x2019;t revealed himself. Of course, you can&#x2019;t be him, right, Young Master Guan?&#x201D; He chuckles nervously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do I look like a maniac?&#x201D; you laugh, expressing your mock offense.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, of course you aren&#x2019;t. You don&#x2019;t look the part at all, Young Master Guan,&#x201D; says Xuzhan. &#x201C;But there is one person who does.&#x201D; His voice drops into an even lower whisper. The other monks and pugilists nod amongst themselves nervously, as if they know who he is talking about.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We think he is it. That boy over there.&#x201D; Xuzhan points towards a hulking figure sitting alone in the center of the registration hall. His fists are callused and his muscular build is intimidating. A girl in peasant dress is sitting by him. Every other competitor is giving him a wide berth, reminding you of the time you met Zhang Jue himself. Even from here, however, you can tell that the large boy is nothing like Master Zhang. He lacks that sharp, menacing aura that emanates from the man as easily as he breathes &#x2013; the same aura that Master Zhang says you already possess, should you decide not to hide it. He is not a killer. Perhaps it takes one to recognize one &#x2013; you doubt most of the youths in this hall have ever killed another person, let alone ten or a hundred.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who is he?&#x201D; you ask quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, no one dares to get close enough to find out, just in case he turns out to be the real thing. I mean, it&#x2019;s not much consolation for the sects to punish him if you&#x2019;re already dead,&#x201D; says Xuzhan, still nervous. &#x201C;But I think he registered his name as Guo Fu. I&#x2019;m not sure if that&#x2019;s his real name, but it could be.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s not that bad,&#x201D; you say cheerily. As you get up and walk over, the young pugilists look at you in horror.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Someone pull him back! Hey!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You do it!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, this is why I hate newbies who don&#x2019;t know a thing about the pugilistic world!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Some familiar shouts come from behind you as you approach the boy. Up close, you can see he is perhaps a year or two older than you. He is tall, probably as tall as Master Zhang, even at his age, and well built. You don&#x2019;t doubt that he could lift an ox.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hello,&#x201D; you say politely, with your best charming smile. &#x201C;My name is Guan Shide. I am a humble merchant&#x2019;s son, and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a second?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The boy turns to look at you. You can see the wheels turning in his head as he ponders your sudden appearance. Then, he nods, smiling faintly. &#x201C;Of course. I think I would like nothing better.&#x201D; The girl by his side, a mousy-looking peasant, jabs him. &#x201C;Manners, Fu! Introduce yourself.&#x201D; She turns to you and bows. &#x201C;My name is Pu&#x2019;er. This is my husband, Guo Fu. Why do we have the pleasure of your presence?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You sit down besides the couple. &#x201C;I am just a humble merchant&#x2019;s son, as I said. Your husband&#x2019;s dignified presence drew my curiosity. By the way, you are married?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Guo Fu smiles as he places a large hand on his wife&#x2019;s shoulder as she blushes. &#x201C;Yes, for a few months now. We were betrothed from birth.&#x201D; Pu&#x2019;er nods and continues her husband&#x2019;s statement. &#x201C;There were some circumstances that stopped us from getting married earlier.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Congratulations to the both of you!&#x201D; you say earnestly. &#x201C;I wish you matrimonial bliss even unto your white-haired days.&#x201D; The two blush deeply as they thank you in return, their hands tightly held together. It is something you have never experienced, you muse, and for just an instant you feel slightly envious. Then, you continue, &#x201C;So, Young Master Guo, what brings you here to the tournament? Should you not be working to support your pretty new wife?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The boy&#x2019;s wide face settles into a frown. &#x201C;That is a long story, sir. I cannot give you the full details, but I was once a farmer&#x2019;s child. We lost our land. My parents died. I wandered around and only found Pu&#x2019;er again recently. But these days it is hard for an orphan to find land of his own to work. So I decided to join a school where they could take me on as an apprentice to do odd jobs, while Pu&#x2019;er could work as a maid. But again it is hard, they didn&#x2019;t even talk to me most of the time. I heard of the tournament and decided to join. I thought if I fought hard enough here they would notice me. I mean, if I am a member of a school, I will be more liked, and Pu&#x2019;er could be more safe.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As he finishes his tale in halting sentences, you listen intently, nodding. He could make his way with just physical labour, but you understand why he doesn&#x2019;t, even if he does not say it out loud. In terms of short-term results it may not be much different, but in terms of a long-term career, it is a rather significant difference. This is his dream &#x2013; not to work long hours hauling cargo while his wife washes dishes at a nearby restaurant, but to eventually become a respected pugilist so that he may protect her, and she may be proud of him. Of course, looking at her gaze, you can tell that she is <i>already</i> proud to be his wife.<br>
<br>
You nod and pat him on the shoulder. &#x201C;You are a remarkable man, Guo Fu. I could only wish that I had even half of your drive and responsible nature.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you,&#x201D; he rumbles. &#x201C;This is the first time anyone has spoken to us since we came here. For some reason, everyone is afraid of us. I do not know why. You are a kind man, Master Guan. I am happy that I met at least one kind man here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Smiling at Guo Fu and Pu&#x2019;er, you bow and take your leave; being labelled as the disciple of Zhang Jue will probably bring him trouble later on, but it is not really any business of yours, is it? At any rate, it is time for you to register in the tournament.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You register publicly as Zhang Jue&#x2019;s apprentice. People may or may not believe you, but doing so will definitely send an uproar throughout the entire competition.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You register as Guan Shide, humble merchant&#x2019;s son. You believe you can still keep up the act even if you are competing.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You run out and try to purchase a mask, but you find that the tiger and wolf masks are all gone. All that is left is a pig&#x2019;s mask. You register under the pseudonym:<br>
Pick one-<br>
Wild Pig<br>
Beautiful Pig<br>
Tiger Pig<br>
Man Tiger Pig<br>
Dancing Pig<br>
Zhang Jue<br>
Rong Zhiyu<br>
Nameless the Second<br>
Shu Ji<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Once rumours begin, they are almost impossible to stop &#x2013; people are convinced that the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s apprentice is here. However, they can be easy to encourage. You could try to incite more people to believe that Guo Fu is the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s apprentice, to draw attention away from you.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You inflame the rumours, pretending to be terrified by your brief encounter with him and spreading word that Guo Fu <i>is </i>truly the Maniac&#x2019;s disciple.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You do not do anything about the rumours. Your method of registration will have the desired effect by itself.

					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Man Tiger Pig</span></b><br>
<br>
The official in charge of the registration stares at you as you walk up to him. &#x201C;Not another one&#x2026;&#x201D; he mutters under his breath. Despite his misgivings, the process goes off without a hitch. You put down your name as Man Tiger Pig, and hand over the crest to complete your registration. As you walk away from the table, the Shaolin monk Xuzhan spots you. He looks at you with a slightly curious expression and comes over.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sir, might you be-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
You nod quickly and gesture at him to follow you to a more secluded area. Once the two of you are there, he scratches his bald head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Might you be Young Master Guan?&#x201D; he asks in a whisper. You see no need to keep up the pretense, and nod.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My father let me come, but he doesn&#x2019;t want me shaming the family name, you see. My merchant family isn&apos;t too fond of martial arts,&#x201D; you explain quickly. &#x201C;He would only let me participate on the condition that I appear masked. I&#x2019;m sorry to ask this of you, sir monk, but could you help me keep this secret?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sure,&#x201D; he says without hesitation. &#x201C;I mean, it&#x2019;s <i>the </i>Young Tigers tournament! I wouldn&#x2019;t want you to miss the chance to compete! Don&#x2019;t worry, we&#x2019;ll understand why you have the mask on, and we&#x2019;ll make sure no one else knows it&#x2019;s actually you underneath. For a minute there I thought talking to the boy who seems to be the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s apprentice had scared you out of your wits!&#x201D; You had expected a monk to be more conflicted about lying, but in this case it seems that Xuzhan is more excited about the tournament than about his vows. You thank him profusely. When you return to his group of friends, he gives them a quick, quiet summary of what has just happened, and they give you knowing nods and encouraging smiles. Now that all of you are registered, you begin discussing the tournament in further detail.<br>
<br>
According to them, the Eight Sects&#x2019; favoured format is the team competition, where most of their disciples would be participating. Their teamwork and discipline gives them the advantage for that format, compared to impromptu teams cobbled together from lesser schools. It is also not uncommon for Eight Sects&#x2019; teams to consist of the better members from different sects as they attempt to get their superior disciples into the finals. The Eight Sects&#x2019; disciples usually work together to eliminate as many of the riff-raff as possible, whether in the team matches or in the battle royales. In the last three competitions, all of the thirty two participants in the finals were from the Eight Sects.<br>
<br>
The preliminary matches  would be conducted tomorrow. Participants who were interested in forming a team could do so today. Those who did not would automatically be enrolled into the battle royale. The young Shaolin monks and their friends had already come here with their teams assigned; you would not be able to join them even if you wanted to. If you wanted to make a team, you would have to search on your own. Bidding goodbye to them, you begin wandering about the great hall. The number of people seems to have lessened, as the participants begin leaving the place after completing their registration.<br>
<br>
A plain girl steps in front of you, giving you a challenging look. You look back at her from behind the mask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing,&#x201D; she whispers softly enough that only you can hear. &#x201C;That is a very stupid disguise. Who do you think you&#x2019;re fooling?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You fight back the sudden panic and stare at her face. It is very plain and average. Forgettable &#x2013; no one you&#x2019;ve seen before. You have not met this girl before, you&#x2019;re sure. On the other hand, there is really only one person in this city who knows your true identity and would speak to you like that.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is this how you really look, Qilin? No wonder you only appear before me with your face made up,&#x201D; you whisper back.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now, that&#x2019;s rude! It&#x2019;s an acupuncture technique, of course I don&apos;t look like this!&#x201D; she hisses vainly. &#x201C;Anyway, out here I&#x2019;m called Xiaoxiang. Are you using Guan Shide, or&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Man Tiger Pig.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She spends the next minute laughing, unable to form any coherent words.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, alright,&#x201D; she says, after she recovers, &#x201C;anyway, have you heard about the preliminary matches?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod. &#x201C;Battle royale or team, right? Which are you going for?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I had thought about going for the battle royale, but someone unexpected approached me to team up. Murong Yandi, the Sword Saint&#x2019;s disciple.&#x201D; Her eyes are gleaming with sly interest. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s looking for anyone he can get. Something about his master advising him to learn cooperation, I think. It works out for me if I can piggy-back on the stronger fighters of the competition, so I&apos;m not complaining.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shouldn&#x2019;t he have no problem finding teammates? I don&#x2019;t see why he&#x2019;d pick a plain girl like you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I may be plain but I have my charms,&#x201D; she says, sticking her tongue out at you. &#x201C;To be precise, when he approached me his words were, &#x2018;Join my team and help me recruit two other people&#x2019;. I get the feeling he might have been too lazy to look for teammates and decided to ask the first person he saw for help. Lucky me! So, what are <i>you </i>going for?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t made a decision,&#x201D; you admit.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you join my team? Then I can have you do all the work.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You really are shameless, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;An adult knows no shame.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure that&#x2019;s an actual saying.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who cares? I won&apos;t be lectured by some boy in a pig&apos;s mask. I still need to find one more person if you join, anyway, so decide quickly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You consider her offer. If you join the team matches, you would be facing the better orthodox students, and would likely face at least one of the Eight Sects&#x2019; elites before even meeting in the finals. The battle royale would offer you better odds of sneaking through without too much of a fight. You would be able to keep your prowess relatively concealed in the melee. On the other hand, it may be a good opportunity for you to get to know the Sword Saint&#x2019;s disciple. His master is one of the wielders of the Ten Great Swords &#x2013; this may prove to be a useful contact in the future. Besides that, you are certain that the farmer boy would not be fighting in a team. You could do him a favour by putting him in the team, helping him advance as far as possible.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You join Qilin&#x2019;s team and leave it up to her to recruit the last member.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You join Qilin&#x2019;s team and recruit Guo Fu as the last member of your team.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You do not join the team, and attempt to form your own team instead, seeking out whoever you can get.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You do not join the team, preferring to participate in the battle royale and win qualification that way.

            <h3>十 · Heroes of Taishan</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Heroes of Taishan</span></b><br>
<br>
Qilin laughs, looking at the group that you have been entered into. &#x201C;Just our luck,&#x201D; she grins. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re facing four of the Taishan Seven Heroic Youths in the first match.&#x201D; You look at the other teams in the group &#x2013; one consists of second-string Kunlun participants, and the other is an impromptu collection of participants much like your own. &#x201C;Does anyone know anything about them?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
Guo Fu shakes his head slowly. He still hasn&#x2019;t seem to caught on to the fact that you have met him before putting on the mask. The young farmer boy had been very grateful when you approached him to team up yesterday, to the extent of trying to buy a roasted pig&#x2019;s thigh for you in gratitude. You had to turn it down; he and his wife would probably need the food more than you do. You could always just steal Qilin&#x2019;s snakes in a pinch if you were starving. The disciple of the Sword Saint looks away when you turn your eyes to him. Well-groomed and dashing in his blue clothes, the boy nevertheless seems uncomfortable around the three of you, even though he had been the first to moot the idea of a team.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If I&#x2019;m not mistaken, they specialize in the Qixing Beitou Formation (&#x5317;&#x6597;&#x4E03;&#x661F;&#x9663;,Big Dipper Formation). I&#x2019;ve not seen it in action before, but I&#x2019;ve heard that it is intricate and everchanging. Taishan is also famous for the Qixing Luokong (&#x4E03;&#x661F;&#x843D;&#x7A7A;,Seven Stars Fall Empty), a sword technique that attacks the seven main pressure points of the body with qi,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have any further details; I don&#x2019;t know much about them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, at least we know they&#x2019;ll be fighting mainly with swords. That means it&#x2019;s a job for our swordsman over there,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;W-what?&#x201D; says Murong Yandi, surprised to be brought into the conversation. &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this a team fight?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is, but you&#x2019;re also the disciple of the Sword Saint, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; you explain. &#x201C;You should be good enough with a sword to beat them handily.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t see what that has to do with anything.&#x201D; A frown creases his brow as he ponders your masked head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;m just getting you ready for the very high possibility that all four of them will be coming for you from the start,&#x201D; you say. Murong falls silent, his eyes twitching with a nervous tic. &#x201C;I-I&#x2019;ll handle that when it happens. Just fight as best as you can.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A tournament official calls out the names of your team before he can say anything else. Elsewhere, some teams have already begun their matches. You pay them no attention, however &#x2013; your first hurdle in this tournament is just ahead of you.<br>
<br>
When your team arrives on the small stage, the Taishan disciples are already present. First you are expected to introduce yourselves to each other. You do so, giving your pseudonym and eliciting a chuckle from the opposing side. They seem relaxed and confident. They give their names in return, but in your mind you have already begun labelling them Taishan One, Two, Three and Four, like what the young Shaolin monks called them in private. You can tell that they are rather strong, but nothing about them really makes much of an impression on you, although your sense for danger &#x2013; never a very strong sense &#x2013; may have been spoiled by Zhang&#x2019;s training.<br>
<br>
The signal to fight is given.<br>
<br>
Instantly, all four of them head towards Murong Yandi, attempting to take who they deem to be the strongest enemy out of the match at the start. His face freezes in fright as his pre-fight bravado finally gives way. As they swing their swords at him, Murong Yandi suddenly gives out a loud, panicked yell. Drawing his sword, he parries their attacks almost instantaneously, giving himself enough space to step back. Despite his frantic swings, you can tell that he was in control of his movements &#x2013; defending against four at once is no mean feat, as you have found out yourself.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, hey,&#x201D; you call out, &#x201C;you&#x2019;re ruining your cool image.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you aren&#x2019;t going to help me, stand back while I take care of them all myself,&#x201D; he retorts, deftly parrying another flurry of attacks from the four Taishan disciples.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Someone&#x2019;s already gone to help,&#x201D; you say cheerfully. Guo Fu rushes at the Taishan disciples from the side. His bull charge scatters them, forcing them to pull away from Murong Yandi. Two of the disciples &#x2013; the ones you have labelled Three and Four, get around Guo Fu and continue going after the swordsman, who curses. Even so, he continues to defend instead of going on the attack.<br>
<br>
One and Two continue to battle Guo Fu. He is surpisingly nimble for his size, and what he can&#x2019;t dodge he blocks. Since the weapons given for the tournament are blunted, he stops the swords against his bare arms without any problems. He does not aim his attacks well, however, and the Taishan disciples manage to dance away from his blows without taking any damage. &#x201C;It looks like they want to defeat the better fighters and leave the weaker ones for later,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Yes, we&#x2019;re probably being left for later, but they&#x2019;re attempting to force Guo Fu out of the ring,&#x201D; says Qilin. You can see that the big fighter is gradually being pushed towards the edge of the arena, just as she said. &#x201C;They can&#x2019;t beat him down any other way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you going to join in, then?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you? You&#x2019;re supposed to be the strongest one here,&quot; says Qilin slyly.<br>
<br>
Well, if she puts it that way&#x2026;<br>
<br>
You head towards Guo Fu first &#x2013; Murong Yandi seems to be defending himself against two opponents with no problems. Placing one hand on his broad shoulders, you vault over his head and introduce your knee to his opponent&#x2019;s face. Taishan One staggers back, clutching his nose. You tilt your head to one side, putting your hands on your hips, and bend over slightly to look at him in mock, wordless concern.<br>
<br>
Grim determination flashing in his eyes, he settles into a stance, his sword raised high above his head, and charges at you. After a second of deliberation, you keep your sword tucked into your waist-sash, deciding to fight him unarmed. Taishan One swings his sword down, attempting to decide the fight with a single blow to the neck. It misses. You step to the side, avoiding his attack entirely. As you deliberate on the type of counterattack to use, Taishan One spins and sends his foot flying towards your face. You duck down on instinct. He follows without hesitation, sweeping his sword upwards to catch you as you crouch. Exhaling, you move a bit faster, just fast enough that the blade doesn&#x2019;t even catch the tip of your nose.<br>
<br>
Taishan One looks at you with mild disbelief, finding it hard to accept that some joker in a pig&#x2019;s mask has avoided his moves. After that initial assault you can tell that he is technically skilled, but&#x2026;<br>
<br>
You take a basic stance, fists held up. You&#x2019;ll step up your game a bit more. As Taishan One settles back into his sword stance, you act first. Lunging forward, you throw a punch at his face. He jerks to the side, surprised at your sudden speed. Bending your outstretched arm, you drive your elbow into the side of his face before he can react &#x2013; perhaps a bit too lightly, as he staggers to the side instead of being knocked down like you hoped. You take a step back, allowing Taishan One to retreat. Raising an open hand, you make a beckoning gesture, daring him to come.<br>
<br>
With a growl, he charges at you. The both of you exchange a few more blows, with none of his landing properly, before a strike from your palm pushes him away again. It looks like for all his skill, he cannot compensate for your superior speed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Erfu, Sanzhu, Shiwan, to me!&#x201D; he shouts, as he backs away from you hurriedly. The other Taishan disciples break away from their respective fights and get into position around Taishan One in a formation of some sorts.<br>
<br>
You look over at Guo Fu and Murong Yandi. Both of them are unscathed, and Murong Yandi seems to not even have broken a sweat, though he doesn&#x2019;t seem to have gone on the attack against the Taishan disciples either.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Beitou Qixing Formation!&#x201D; shouts the Taishan disciples in unison, as they make a dramatic pose. You wonder if you should test out the formation alone &#x2013; judging from the name, it is meant for seven people; its true potential should only be seen with all seven members of the Taishan Seven Heroic Youths. A four man formation would have its weaknesses.<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi seems to be in a bad mood as he comes to your side. &#x201C;Could you let me take them all down, Man Tiger Pig? The two of them were saying some rather rude things to me just now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Insist to go at it alone. You survived the nuns&#x2019; six-man formation, a crippled four-man formation shouldn&#x2019;t be any problem for you, especially since none of the other disciples seem to match you in speed and strength. Beating four of them by yourself would be good bragging rights.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Let Murong Yandi handle the formation alone. He seems confident, and this could be a chance to see what he can really do. You might meet him in the elimination stages, and if he wants to show off you can benefit from seeing his techniques.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Offer to team up with Murong Yandi for the fight. The formation might be more than either of you are expecting, since none of you have actually experienced it before, and it would be safer this way.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>Everyone is going to fight. You get Guo Fu and Qilin to help you and Murong Yandi. Qilin is not getting out of this match without even lifting a smug little finger. It <i>is </i>a team fight after all. You don&#x2019;t want to take too much of the spotlight right now.

            <h3>十一 · The Sword Saint&#039;s Disciple</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Sword Saint&#x2019;s Disciple</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Feel free.&#x201D; You give a wide gesture at the Taishan disciples, inviting Murong Yandi to help himself. With a sombre nod and a word of thanks, he steps forward as you retreat. &#x201C;Can he handle it?&#x201D; asks Guo Fu concernedly, rubbing his neck. &#x201C;If he can&#x2019;t, we&#x2019;ll go to his aid,&#x201D; you reply. &#x201C;Xiaoxiang, did the tournament officials issue you with any throwing weapons?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin shakes her head. &#x201C;No, but they gave me some pebbles when I asked.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You could have used it to help us out just now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, the two of you were handling yourselves pretty well. I didn&#x2019;t see the need to interfere.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If Murong doesn&#x2019;t beat them, I&#x2019;ll need you to back us up. Guo Fu will make the initial charge, you will keep them distracted with the pebbles, and I&#x2019;ll pick them off,&#x201D; you say quickly. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a simple tactic, I think we can pull it off.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, sir,&#x201D; says Guo, while Qilin only smiles at you.<br>
<br>
You turn your attention back to Murong Yandi, who is confronting the Taishan formation. His sword is tucked at his waist. He is standing with his arms held to his side, his pose calm and sturdy. The Taishan disciples move as one, surging forward as their feet patter in complex movements.<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi is faster. In a flash he has drawn his sword, raising it up high and gripping the hilt with both hands. As he brings it down hard, well before the Taishan fighters have reached him, you can see a faint ripple trailing along the sword&#x2019;s movement in the air.<br>
<br>
<i>Sword qi</i>. He is channeling his inner strength into the sword, using it as a conduit to extend his reach. A tangible, barely visible pressure emanates from his blade like a visible gust of shimmering wind. It roars forward and hits Taishan Two and Three  before they can get out of the way. They are thrown backwards by the force, knocking them clear out of the ring. You had heard that skilled swordsmen could cut their targets without touching them physically with a sword, but this was the first time you had seen sword qi in action. The remaining two pause in shock.<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi does not stop. He closes the distance, as swift as a snake, and thrusts his sword into Taishan Four&#x2019;s abdomen. Although the blade does not pierce flesh, a ragged hole is torn in Taishan Four&#x2019;s clothes where he struck, as Murong Yandi channels his sword qi to augment his thrust. Taishan Four falls to him, and he turns to take on Taishan One. Before you know it, the match is over, with Taishan One kneeling in surrender.<br>
<br>
For some reason, you can feel your fingers twitching in anticipation. The swordsman is fast, true enough, but you think you might just be a little faster. Pitting your skills against him should teach you some interesting tricks - you are already beginning to wonder how you can overcome his sword energy.<br>
<br>
The tournament official, slightly flabbergasted at Murong&#x2019;s swift victory, declares your team the winner of the match. The Taishan disciples hobble off, looking fearfully at the Sword Saint&#x2019;s disciple as they leave.<br>
<br>
You whistle as Murong comes back to the team. &#x201C;Those were some really fancy moves. What did they say to get you so angry?&#x201D; He scowls slightly, shaking his head. &#x201C;I am still nothing compared to my master, and I would prefer not to gossip about their rude behaviour.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fair enough, Young Master Murong. By the way, if you can beat four of the Taishan Seven Heroic Youths so easily, why haven&#x2019;t you won the tournament before this?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
To your surprise, Murong Yandi flushes slightly. &#x201C;I-It&#x2019;s my first time participating in a public tournament. I only joined this year because I desired to fight the famous Bai Jiutian, but to my disappointment he did not participate.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You suppose he harbours some slight feelings of rivalry towards the Huashan swordsman said to be the best of your generation. As the disciple of the swordsman who is the best of <i>his </i>generation &#x2013; indeed, <i>the </i>best of any current living generation &#x2013; he would definitely have to surpass Bai Jiutian to be acknowledged as a pupil worthy of his master.<br>
<br>
The remaining two matches go by extremely quickly. After Murong Yandi&#x2019;s display of power, a dejected despair set itself in the remaining competitors in your group. The two matches were solved by merely having Guo Fu toss them out of the ring. Taishan also beat the other two schools, but by the end of the day the result was clear: you would be advancing into the elimination finals.<br>
<br>
The winners of the preliminary stages are called into the main hall to draw the lots for the tournament brackets. Each contestant&#x2019;s name would be called out, and a number would be drawn to determine their position in the bracket. Looking around, you can see a few familiar faces. Xuzhan and three of his monk friends are present. So are Yifang and the Emei nuns, though Cao&#x2019;er is not around. You note the Three Wudang Brothers have made it, standing with dignity in their Taoist robes. A sole young beggar is scratching his behind shamelessly at the back of the hall. Interestingly, there are also three other participants besides you in animal masks &#x2013; a tiger, a wolf and a cock.<br>
<br>
As the drawing begins, Qilin stands on the tip of her toes and whispers sweetly in your ear, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t drink the water from tomorrow onwards.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The contestants&#x2019; names are called out one by one, and strips of cloth bearing their name are pinned on the great wooden board as they receive their numbers. One by one, the first matches for tomorrow are filled up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm, I&#x2019;m facing the beggar,&#x201D; mutters Qilin. &#x201C;He should be able to take something stronger.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Your name is called. Then, your number is drawn. They pin your cloth on the board, next to Yiling of Emei &#x2013; the nun that had come in second in last year&#x2019;s tournament.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ooh, good luck,&#x201D; giggles Qilin. You sigh underneath the mask.<br>
<br>
When the drawing is complete, you peer at the board, taking note of the people you know.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You exit the tournament area separately from the others. Finding a quiet, deserted alley, you quickly remove the mask and shove it into your garments. The sun is setting and soon the streets will be dark, though the city is lively at all times of the day. Suddenly, you hear a loud cry from behind you.<br>
<br>
Turning around, you see a person garbed entirely in black, even though it&#x2019;s still light. They raise their hand to strike at you. You instinctively parry their attack, knocking their arm aside. You can see slight surprise in the person&#x2019;s uncovered eyes that you deflected their blow so easily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Somebody stop that bastard!&#x201D; shouts someone else. As a man garbed in the yellow Kunlun uniform rush in, the person-in-black laughs. You cannot tell whether it is a man or a woman. In a thin, reedy voice, they proclaim, &#x201C;Foolish do-gooders. I am the disciple of Zhang Jue! You will never capture me so easily!&#x201D; You hold back an urge to declare that <i>you&#x2019;re </i>his disciple. &#x201C;You attacked me,&#x201D; shouts the man. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re not getting off that easily, regardless of who you are to the Southern Maniac!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With another laugh, the person-in-black leaps up a nearby building and runs. The Kunlun disciple attempts to give chase, but collapses from his injuries. You are about to go and help him, but a group of orthodox sect members are already coming to his aid.<br>
<br>
What a troublesome encounter. You had actually planned to secretly drop by where the Emei was staying and get into contact with Cao&#x2019;er so that you could prepare for your match with the nun Yiling tomorrow. She should know a thing or two. Unfortunately, you also feel like you should go after this strange impostor immediately before you get framed for worse matters. This could be related to the invite that Master Zhang received - as the Abbess had said, it was unusual for the tournament committee to do so. You&#x2019;re afraid that if you give chase, however, you will run out of time to dredge up information about your next opponent, and would have to rely on what you can find out tomorrow morning before the match.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Go after the impostor and attempt to find out what is going on.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Meet up with Cao&#x2019;er to discuss Yiling - your match is more important.

            <h3>十二 · Tournament Preparations</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tournament Preparations</span></b><br>
<br>
You bound up a nearby crate and onto the rooftops, deciding to go after the person-in-black. Spotting the figure receding into the distance, gliding over large gaps between the buildings with their qinggong, you give chase. Running atop a solid roof is far easier than running along shaky tree branches. Although you can&#x2019;t soar through the air like your target, your stride is faster. As you hop and vault over obstacles and gaps, you begin to close the distance. You seem to be headed into the poorer districts of the city, where people tend to keep their heads down.<br>
<br>
The figure turns their head, looking back at you. Suddenly, they stop in their tracks and reverse direction. Their hostile intent is clear.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Decided to fight instead of running?&#x201D; you call out. &#x201C;That suits me just fine.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The person-in-black strikes just as your feet touch the roof that they are on. A palm comes whistling through the air, aimed right for your head. You dive forward, throwing yourself down low before it hits. Pressing your outstretched hands against the roof tiles, you push yourself forward. You can feel the tiles crack slightly underneath your fingers as you fly past the person-in-black. With a quick flip you get back to your feet.<br>
<br>
The person-in-black turns around, but too late. You throw a quick jab at them. Unable to avoid, they cross their arms to block. The force of your blow drives them staggering backwards until their heels are hanging out over thin air. As the mysterious person teeters on the verge of falling, you reach out to grab them. Their eyes are squeezed tightly closed. Before your fingers reach the person, they whistle loudly.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, three other black-clad figures arrive, surrounding you. You had been too hasty in chasing your target. &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this a bit unfair-&#x201C; Your words are cut off as they descend upon you with a flurry of blows. You parry their punches swiftly; none of them are anywhere near as fast as Master Zhang, or even Sister Miaozhu and her nuns, but the sheer amount of strikes manages to force you back. Still, you are not too keen on using your full strength here &#x2013; you don&#x2019;t want to make things too messy if you can help it.<br>
<br>
Knocking aside a kick, you grab the outstretched leg, pulling it towards you and smashing the back of your fist into your assailant&#x2019;s side. As they are sent crashing to the floor, you spin around and smoothly segue into the only move of the Xianglong Palms that you know, attacking with a quick surge of your inner strength. Your palm zips forward like a striking snake, throwing another of the shady figures backwards with the briefest contact. With that same arm, you turn and grab the last of the three newcomers by the neck.<br>
<br>
Your grip is strong &#x2013; you could rip their throat out easily. Your fingers begin to dig in as the figure struggles helplessly. &#x201C;Look,&#x201D; you sigh, offering them a way out, &#x201C;can&#x2019;t we just talk about this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The first person-in-black you chased leaps at you with a battlecry. Now there is no mistaking it; it is a girl. You turn to hurl her partner at her, but instead something is thrown at you. Something round. It explodes in your face, releasing a thick cloud of smoke. As you choke and sputter, a palm slams into your chest. Caught by surprise, you release your grip on your hostage.<br>
<br>
Then, there is a familiar, exceedingly unpleasant feeling. That of thorns worming their way inside you, inflicting pain and agony. You have felt this once before. The woman in black. It is not as strong, however, though you do not know if it is due to your growth, or because this practitioner is not as skilled.<br>
<br>
They are the enemy. They are Shun&#x2019;s enemy. They are <i>definitely </i>your enemy.<br>
<br>
After three years, you have finally found someone who may lead you to the woman in black.<br>
<br>
This is unmistakeably the Yuhua Duqing Palm.<br>
<br>
It is different this time, however. You are not who you once were.<br>
<br>
Excitement boils within you. Your qi stirs in response.<br>
<br>
Like a rising tide of formless mud, Yuanshi Hundun rises up to meet the agonizing qi, swallowing it whole. The strike is still enough to leave you breathless, but you are otherwise unharmed. There was too little inner strength behind that blow to overcome your neigong.<br>
<br>
As you expected, the people-in-black are gone when the smoke clears. You cluck your tongue in slight disappointment.<br>
<br>
Looking around, you find no trace of where they have gone. No matter. They are, for some reason, running around trying to link themselves to Zhang Jue. From the time you spent with him you understand that he is probably the last person who would be linked to this sort of organization &#x2013; they are simply too clandestine for his tastes. These mysterious people should be here until the tournament ends, at least; your invitation was probably no coincidence.<br>
<br>
Luckily, they seem to have no idea who you really are, though your little attack will have put them on guard. They should think you are nothing more than some noble young do-gooder - plenty of those in town during the tournament period - who passed by and decided to stick his nose into matters not of his business. This just means that you will have to be a bit more thoughtful regarding these people from now on so that you may devise a plan to lure them out.<br>
<br>
Then, you will have the pleasure of interrogating them&#x2026; those that survive, at least.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You arrive late the next morning &#x2013; though you had thought you were unaffected by the Yuhua Duqing Palm, it seems that it had some lingering side-effects. You feel slightly dizzy, though it should not affect your performance too much. You approach the tournament hall with your mask already on. There are many fighters milling about the place. Before entering the hall proper, you look around for any signs of the Emei nuns.<br>
<br>
You spot Cao&#x2019;er together with Yifang and her friends. Perfect. This is the first thing you will do.<br>
<br>
With a measured gait, you walk past Cao&#x2019;er, heading off to a more secluded area.<br>
<br>
Turning the corner, you count the seconds.<br>
<br>
She pokes her head from behind the wall after ten seconds. Lifting your mask slightly so that she can see your face, you grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;knew it was you!&#x201D; she squeaks, as she walks up to you excitedly. You make a hushing gesture.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Does anyone else know?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;no, don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201D; she shakes her head. &#x201C;They don&#x2019;t seem to have noticed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good. You look much better if your hair isn&#x2019;t covering all of your face, by the way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a croak, she fiddles with her hair embarrassedly. You begin to engage her in small talk, asking about her life at Emei. She seems to be doing fine, but says that life at the monastery does not suit her. There are too many rules for her to follow, and she feels awkward around the other nuns. When you ask if she wants to go off with you after the tournament, however, she declines, saying that there is still quite a lot more that she has to learn, and that she will stick to the agreement.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;no matter how much I want to elope with you&#x2026;&#x201D; she sighs. You try to ignore a rather strange word that she used in that sentence, and move on to your opponent for today, the nun Yiling.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She is skilled,&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;Not as skilful as my sister though&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are surprised. You had fought Yifang before this, and seen her rather dismal performance against the bandits. Either Yiling is not very good, in which case you should be able to handle everyone in the competition easily &#x2013; Murong Yandi aside &#x2013; or Yifang is a lot better than you had thought her to be.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose&#x2026; Yifang is bad in a real fight, but she is really good in sparring when she is less nervous,&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er after deliberating for a while. &#x201C;She told me this is the first time she participated in the tournament. She never dared to before.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why is that?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er stares at you rather coldly. &#x201C;&#x2026;your fault. You said something about understanding you. She found out you were invited&#x2026; so she thought she could understand you better by participating&#x2026; I suppose it is okay because she is my sister and sisters share&#x2026;&#x201D; She begins to mumble some words that make less sense to you the more you think about it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;m sorry I said it,&#x201D; you apologize. It looks like that nun may be a source of future headaches due to your careless words. For that you really are sorry. &#x201C;Is there anything more you can tell me about Yiling?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;you aren&#x2019;t interested in her also, right? No, I guess not, it&#x2019;s for the fight,&#x201D; nods Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;I have to think on it. I remember some of her sparring matches&#x2026; I will tell you later&#x2026; Anyway, have you gotten the schedule for your match?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You had almost forgotten. Feeling embarrassed that you had to be reminded by Cao&#x2019;er of all people, you head to check out the schedule.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The first round of the tournament was divided into two sessions, with one taking place after the other. The matches in each session would take place simultaneously.<br>
<br>
The matches in the first session are as follows:<br>
<br>
Xumao vs Faceless<br>
<br>
Yiqing vs Nie Shuixian<br>
<br>
Wu Tong vs Mo Liuye<br>
<br>
Su Liaojing vs Xuzheng<br>
<br>
Zhou Xiaowu vs Gan Maqi<br>
<br>
Gu Dipeng vs Yifang<br>
<br>
Xuzhan vs Ma Youxuan<br>
<br>
Xuzhu vs Yixing<br>
<br>
The remainder of the matches are in the second session.<br>
<br>
Nameless vs Shapeless<br>
<br>
Zhu Cangxu vs Lantu<br>
<br>
Xu Wanke vs Wu Yin<br>
<br>
Xiaoxiang vs Gao Xiaoma<br>
<br>
Li Mao vs Murong Yandi<br>
<br>
Wu Jin vs Guo Fu<br>
<br>
Yiling vs Man Tiger Pig<br>
<br>
Jixuan Wuni vs Nie Mudan<br>
<br>
You could check out one of the matches in the first session yourself. You would be fighting in the second session, so you could have to ask Cao&#x2019;er to watch one of those matches for you, although she would also be free to observe a single match in the first session.<br>
<br>
Of the participants, there are a few surprising entrees besides the disciples of the Eight Sects &#x2013; they are saying that this is the first time there has been so many independent finalists in twenty years.<br>
<br>
The most interesting of that lot are the trio of Nameless, Faceless and Shapeless, who are appearing in a tiger, wolf and cock mask respectively. They participated in the battle royale and swept to victory &#x2013; in fact, they could be said to be the reason there were a few other independent finalists, as the three had purposely targeted Eight Sects&#x2019; disciples in each of their battle royales, proving skilled enough to knock out a few promising participants, allowing the independent participants to sneak into the last four standing. As a result, Qingcheng had been utterly eliminated from the competition, though their best young fighter, the new head of the sect, Song Lingshu was in mourning and did not participate, deciding to be a spectator instead. Ma Youxuan and Xu Wanke seem to be rather average pugilists from average schools, but Jixuan Wuni and Lantu are foreigners; Tibetan and Tujue, respectively.<br>
<br>
You also found a grinning beggar offering to take bets on the matches. For this first round you simply do not know enough to place any of your meagre pittance on any of the other contestants; but you could opt to have Cao&#x2019;er help you bet on your own match&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Choice of matches to watch:<br>
<br>
You may pick one match from the first session to spectate personally.<br>
<br>
You may pick one match from the first session and one match for the second session for Cao&#x2019;er to observe.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You bet on Yiling winning.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You bet on yourself winning.

            <h3>十三 · Match One: Yiling</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Match One: Yiling</span></b><br>
<br>
The crowd roars with laughter when you are introduced. You step onto the stage with your mask firmly in place, casually waving both your hands in the air. The Emei nun, Yiling, is scowling at you, her sword at the ready. From what you have heard, she is a couple of years older than you and this could be her last youth tournament. Yiling will be taking this match seriously &#x2013; she is out to win it.<br>
<br>
The tournament official raises his flag, signalling for the fighters to get ready. The both of you settle into a stance &#x2013; she keeps her sword close to her body but pointed upwards, in the typical Emei fashion. You leave your sword tucked into the sash again, deciding to adopt a basic fighting stance; fists balled and raised.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you underestimating me?&#x2019; asks the nun, slightly perturbed that you don&#x2019;t seem to take her seriously enough to adopt a proper stance. You shake your head vigorously but say nothing in return, causing her to frown.<br>
<br>
The flag falls, and the gong is sounded.<br>
<br>
The nun begins stepping sideways warily as she tries to find a weakness in your position. You turn to follow her, keeping her within your field of vision at all times. The mask limits your view, and you will have to be more careful when fighting with it on.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er has said that this particular nun is not as skilled as Yifang, but that means little to you. You had watched Yifang&#x2019;s match with Gu Dipeng of Kunlun. Her moves were precise and executed without hesitation, a far cry from her fearful performance against the bandits. However, you did not realize what it truly meant until Cao&#x2019;er told you that Yifang&#x2019;s skill in the Emei swordplay, the Qingcheng Stab (&#x503E;&#x57CE;&#x523A;, Alluring Stab) was <i>perfect</i>. Apparently, she does every move flawlessly, unerringly, purely as it is supposed to be; speaking solely in terms of that particular technique she has reached the level of a master. The Emei swordplay is comprehensive enough to provide a basic solution for most situations  &#x2013; in a tournament setting such as this, the relatively inexperienced fighters that make up most of the participants would get their defenses pried open and defeated in just a few moves. The Kunlun disciple had fallen within three minutes.<br>
<br>
You understand what it will take for you to beat Yifang, should you advance that far. You would have to think of a way to defeat the Qingcheng Stab. The Emei swordplay will be your real enemy, not its wielder. Cao&#x2019;er had noted that Yifang executes all the moves by rote, with no variation of her own.<br>
<br>
This match against Yifang&#x2019;s senior will be a good way to test it.<br>
<br>
You graciously allow Yiling to make the first move.<br>
<br>
With a single bounce the nun closes the distance, demonstrating her skill with Emei&#x2019;s qinggong. The jabs and stabs come rapidly from all angles; Yiling appears to be a more forceful fighter than Yifang, putting more strength behind her blows. You duck and evade her attacks with sheer speed, but find no opening to retaliate without using your techniques. Just when you think you can strike back, Yiling would twist her body around gracefully and follow up with a thrust that keeps you off balance. Rather than swordplay, it would be more fitting for an onlooker to call it a sword dance.<br>
<br>
You can do nothing but step back for the moment. A few more seconds of this and you would be stepping off the stage. The nun&#x2019;s face is still serious, determined not to let her guard down until you have lost. You can hear the crowd continuing to laugh. It looks like you are living down to their expectations.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop running, pig!&#x201D; shouts a heckler.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stay still and get stuck!&#x201D; laughs another man.<br>
<br>
You tilt your head from side-to-side, wiggling the floppy pig&#x2019;s ears in acknowledgement and eliciting another round of raucous laughter.<br>
<br>
There&#x2019;s nothing left to do but to take a riskier approach. The tournament swords are blunted; they won&#x2019;t cut you apart, but a strong attack will still hurt. Stepping into the path of the nun&#x2019;s strikes,  you lunge forward. The sword scrapes your side painfully &#x2013; that is going to leave a mark &#x2013; but you surprise Yiling long enough to land a light kick in her abdomen.<br>
<br>
The crowd gasps as she staggers back. You take a stance again, while Yiling looks at the tournament official and the panel of observers from the Eight Sects &#x2013; you see Miecao amongst them. The official shakes his head; that would not have been a lethal hit even if it had been a real sword. You are still allowed to fight.<br>
<br>
Yiling closes her eyes, muttering some prayers. When she turns back to you, she is calmer, falling back into the standard Emei stance. In a split second she resumes the match, stabbing at you faster than before. You begin to perceive slips in her technique, as she begins to get hasty. Leaping over a low thrust from the nun, you throw a quick jab at an opening. She is forced to block it &#x2013; you can see her wince as your fist hits her arm. You land with both feet on her sword while she is distracted, forcing it from her grasp. With a sweeping backhand you force the nun away, long enough for you to kick up her sword, grab it, and point it at her.<br>
<br>
The crowd is shouting in disbelief now, as angry punters begin screaming at the heavens. With a scowl, Yiling pounces at you, attempting to retrieve her sword. Moving quickly, you keep it from her grasp, shifting the sword from hand to hand in between defending against her attacks. Seeing no way to grab it from you, she steps on your foot hard, pinning it to the ground. Then, she makes to reach for her sword again. You toss it in the air, over her head.<br>
<br>
To your surprise, she ignores it, going after the sword tucked at your waist. Your hand intercepts her just as her fingers close around the hilt. Grabbing the nun by the wrist, you spin her about before she can draw your sword. Yiling makes use of the opening to withdraw, twirling back to where her sword has fallen and picking it back up in one fluid movement.<br>
<br>
You put one hand on your piggy chin, posing in a thinking position. The crowd is silent, waiting with bated breath to see what you will do next.<br>
<br>
After exchanging blows with Yiling, and with your experience facing Emei techniques, you think you might be able to overcome the Qingcheng Stab, though it would definitely require you to use your own techniques to have a chance of succeeding.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You utilize the Shouwang Claws. Instead of using your fingers to rend flesh, you will use it to grasp weapons and wrest them from the enemy. You would have to devise a new form of movement to intercept the Qingcheng Stab successfully, but as the weapon is blunted at least you won&#x2019;t be losing your fingers if you fail.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You perform the Chuzhan Fist, changing your target to hit the opponent&#x2019;s hands and arms instead of their body, as the technique was originally meant to do. You would have to control your strength to avoid breaking her limbs as your aim is to attack with just enough force that their hands will be numbed by your attack, leaving them unable to grasp a sword or even form a fist.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You had almost broken the Emei&#x2019;s Guihe Formation with your sword; Abbess Miecao had left behind a sentence of advice for you then. A fish hiding in water is closer than it looks. You think you can apply that saying to this situation, developing a sword technique of your own that draws in an opponent and counters their attack.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You give up and surrender. You don&#x2019;t want to attract any more attention than you already have or reveal any of your techniques.

            <h3>十四 · Tournament Interlude</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tournament Interlude</span></b><br>
<br>
The nun springs to the attack before you are ready. It looks like she wants to win the match rather badly. You take a few hurried steps back, drawing your sword to block her strike. The blunted metal blades meet with a dull clang. With a graceful spin, Yiling crouches low to the floor and angles her sword for an upwards thrust. Her attack is swiftly parried, but she follows up with another flurry of stabs, mixing in quick jabs and powerful lunges.<br>
<br>
Raising your own blade, you bat her sword away again and again. Without a sword you would have been forced to retreat if put on the defensive &#x2013; her Qingcheng Stab cuts off passage to the sides with well-timed jabs, attempting to force the opponent into a narrow corridor dictated by the user of the technique. You use your own sword&#x2019;s movement as cover to evade to the side. Your sudden movement catches her off-guard. As she turns to follow, you bring your sword down in a hard slash. Yiling retreats, leaping back a fair distance in the blink of an eye. Just what you wanted.<br>
<br>
You take a step forward with your right foot, pointing your sword parallel to the ground. Crouching slightly, you kick off from the ground, rushing forward in a powerful lunge. Your Pine-Cutting Sword curves in a deadly arc towards the nun -  Her eyes widen in surprise at the speed of your attack. With a shout, Yiling springs away before she is hit by your slash. She lands close to the edge of the ring, her skillful qinggong doing her more harm than good in this case. You stalk towards her, your sword held in a menacing fashion while you bob your masked face from side-to-side.<br>
<br>
The nun is as good as you thought her to be &#x2013; she judged in an instant that she did not have enough strength to block your strike outright, nor did she have enough speed to evade and stab you. Her only option was to run, and she did that without hesitation.<br>
<br>
If she can think that far, she would also be able to identify the weak point of your technique. The Pine-Cutting Sword, like the Songfeng move it was created from, is simple and easy to see coming. Against lesser opponents the pure strength and speed behind the move would be enough to succeed, but against a skilled fighter it would not be hard for them to dodge and counter. If you tried the move again, Yiling would have a reply for it.<br>
<br>
Stopping a dozen steps away from the nun, you point your sword forwards again. You see a hint of a smirk raised on her lips &#x2013; you know that this time she will be ready.<br>
<br>
You lunge.<br>
<br>
She steps forward, crouching.<br>
<br>
Her sword flies forward in a swift stab, faster than your slash. She is aiming right for your head &#x2013; with the force she&#x2019;s putting into her blow, if it hits you would be knocked out for certain.<br>
<br>
The stab falls short, as you land a couple of paces away from where she predicted you would be.<br>
<br>
An expression of surprise crosses her face, but she recovers quickly. Now is the deciding moment. The first step is to draw the opponent into a failed attack that leaves the both of you in close proximity.<br>
<br>
With a sudden burst of speed, you sprint forward just as you touch the ground, throwing a stab at her. Your speed and proximity forces her to move to parry your stab, her sword flashing into position. Twirling the hilt of your sword in your hand, you grasp it in a reverse-grip, holding the blade folded parallel to your arm. The second step is to execute the feint.<br>
<br>
Her parry meets empty air. Your fist follows through, slipping in between her guard to strike her on the jaw with the sword&#x2019;s hilt. As she staggers back, you flip your sword back into position to deal the third step &#x2013; the finishing blow &#x2013; a quick stab to the chest before the enemy can recover their balance.<br>
<br>
At least, you try to. The sword spins out of control as you twirl the hilt again. With a lighter, shorter sword you would have no problem, but the shoddily-made tournament-issue blunted swords don&#x2019;t exactly have the best balance for this technique, and you don&#x2019;t have the skill to compensate. Your fingers fumble as the sword flies from your grasp and hits Yiling in the forehead hilt-first.<br>
<br>
She stumbles back but doesn&#x2019;t fall off the stage &#x2013; another step and she would have been out of the ring. It would be lucky for you if she did, but alas, you have only managed to lose your sword and anger her. The nun raises her sword. You can tell that she is going to finish you off as fast as she can.<br>
<br>
You raise your hands in apparent surrender as she stares at you, her sword about to strike.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is this? Are you mocking me?&#x201D; she asks furiously.<br>
<br>
You shake your head sadly, the paper ears flopping around comically.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Actually, I&#x2026;&#x201D; you begin. It is the first time you have spoken since coming on stage, and even the nun can&#x2019;t help but pause for a while, slightly curious.<br>
<br>
Then, you exert your inner strength. The primordial chaos within you bursts forth, feeding you strength.<br>
<br>
Moving faster than she has ever seen you move throughout the match, you dart forward, catching her entirely off-guard.<br>
<br>
Your hands, still raised in surrender, clap down on Yiling&#x2019;s shoulders.<br>
<br>
You give her a light shove, sending the nun out of the ring.<br>
<br>
The gong is sounded.<br>
<br>
You have won.<br>
<br>
You raise both your hands and wave at the stunned audience. Abbess Miecao is &#x2013; surprisingly &#x2013; smiling faintly. You thought she would have been more upset at her student&#x2019;s defeat. The crowd roars and groans simultaneously as you are declared the victor, the onlookers excitement mixed with the punters&#x2019; despair. An upset in the first round of the finals was not what anyone had expected.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s a good thing you made that bet.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
In the aftermatch of the match, Cao&#x2019;er comes to you with a bag of taels. After making sure you have given her a reasonable share, you hide it quickly before anyone &#x2013; like Qilin &#x2013; spots it. There is enough money here to buy you a few good meals, perhaps even some nice clothes. You ask Cao&apos;er to continue betting on you - you have money to spare now, though your odds won&apos;t be as lucrative as they were against Yiling. Then, you listen to her report on the match between the mask-wearing Nameless and Shapeless.<br>
<br>
Apparently there was no match at all. The both of them had gone up on stage, and Shapeless had surrendered immediately, to loud boos from the audience. You suppose Nameless is probably the leader of the trio. Besides that, Cao&#x2019;er also tells you something interesting &#x2013; she is certain that they are not Han. She cannot identify their exact ethnicity, but she has come to that conclusion from their words and body language.<br>
<br>
There is not much time for you to rest &#x2013; it looks like the next round should begin fairly soon. It would also be divided into two sessions, as with the previous round.<br>
<br>
The first session would have:<br>
<br>
Faceless vs Nie Shuixian<br>
<br>
Wu Tong vs Su Liaojing<br>
<br>
Zhou Xiaowu vs Yifang<br>
<br>
Xuzhan vs Xuzhu<br>
<br>
While the second session would be:<br>
<br>
Nameless vs Zhu Cangxu<br>
<br>
Wu Yin vs Xiaoxiang<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi vs Guo Fu<br>
<br>
Man Tiger Pig vs Nie Mudan<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er has been summoned by the Abbess for some errands and thus won&#x2019;t be free to help you out for this round. You could opt to watch any of the matches in the first session, or you could use the time to talk to find and talk to some of the other contestants that have lost their first match, and thus will be made to leave the participants&#x2019; area soon.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You watch the matches.<br>
<b>1.</b> Faceless vs Nie Shuixian<br>
<b>2.</b> Wu Tong vs Su Liaojing<br>
<b>3.</b> Zhou Xiaowu vs Yifang<br>

<b>2. </b>The Tibetan fighter Jixuan Wuni.<br>
<b>3. </b>The oldest of the Wudang Brothers, Wu Jin.<br>
<b>4. </b>The cock-masked fighter, Shapeless.

            <h3>十五 · Match Two: Nie Mudan</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Match Two: Nie Mudan</span></b><br>
<br>
The match between the wolf-masked fighter and the Huashan swordswoman turns out to be a rather close call. Both contestants seem to be equally matched, though the masked fighter is employing a style that you have never seen before. At the very least, they don&#x2019;t appear to be from any of the orthodox schools. Nie Shuixian, on the other hand, has opted to use a spear in this fight. She is wielding the spear expertly, keeping her opponent at bay and controlling the stage with its reach. However, she seems unable to capitalize on her advantage, as Faceless is equally adept at self-defense.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What thoughts do you have about the Huashan technique so far?&#x201D; A cultured voice interrupts your observations. Turning, you see a handsome young gentleman dressed in elegant white robes. He is smiling at you. &#x201C;I hope you have found something to help you, Young Master Guan&#x2026; if that is indeed your name.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am indeed Guan Shide,&#x201D; you say carefully. From his posture, you can tell that the gentleman is also a practitioner of martial arts. &#x201C;Pardon me, but who might you be?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, forgive my oversight. I am Bai Jiutian of Huashan. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The pleasure is mine, Young Master Bai.&#x201D; You respond respectfully to the unexpected encounter. This is the Huashan disciple who had won the past tournaments with ease. You wonder how he knows of you. As if seeing the question on your face, he says, &#x201C;After the fight against Yiling, Man Tiger Pig has become one of the hot topics amongst the disciples of the Eight Sects. You are a&#x2026; friend of his, no? I was talking to Shaolin&#x2019;s Xuzhan, and after some questioning he let slip that much. Of course, it is not his fault; I was rudely persistent, and I hope I have not offended.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No offense taken. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you much,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Man Tiger Pig is mysterious in his ways. He comes and goes like the wind, sometimes as a man, at other times a pig, even occasionally a tiger. I cannot call him a friend of mine. What of it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, nothing much. I just found him interesting and hoped that you would be able to tell me more,&#x201D; replies Bai Jiutian. &#x201C;I can say confidently that he has the potential to progress far in this tournament. It is a pity that I am not participating this year. I would relish pitting my skills against him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;His victory over Emei seemed more like a fluke to me,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I doubt he will amount to anything.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Even so, his style is fascinating. Do you know who he trained under? His moves seem to be extremely basic, but I know of no one self-taught who has that sort of power.&#x201D; Bai Jiutian looks at you keenly as he asks his question.<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;I am merely an amateur in martial arts, Young Master Bai. I would not know how to differentiate one school from another. Why, I can barely tell Taishan and Kunlun apart! You are asking the wrong person, I fear. I do not see why a person could not train by themselves and attain that level of skill, however.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is a youth tournament. It is improbable that anyone without a master can become that strong at such a young age,&#x201D; he explains. &#x201C;He would have to be a true prodigy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Improbable, but not impossible,&#x201D; you say simply. &#x201C;The best way for you to find out would be to ask Man Tiger Pig personally.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s smile wavers slightly, though it remains on his charming face. &#x201C;I suppose you are right.&#x201D; The gong sounds &#x2013; a winner has been decided. Nie Shuixian is the winner, but you had not seen how she won; you had been too distracted by Bai Jiutian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I shall take my leave now, Young Master Guan,&#x201D; says Bai Jiutian with a slightly satisfied air about him. &#x201C;I will need to congratulate my junior on her victory. Hopefully I shall be able to congratulate Mudan in her upcoming match too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The crowd cheers more loudly for you the second time you take the stage. You give them a comical bow of gratitude, soaking in their adoration. Opposite you, Nie Mudan is scowling, just as Yiling was. This is familiar; you don&#x2019;t appear to have much luck with women, it seems. The pretty flower of Huashan is wielding a sabre, with a spear strapped to her back and a sword tucked through her waist sash. It looks like she will be holding nothing back. Still, judging from what you&#x2019;ve seen of the fight between her twin and the masked fighter, you should be able to beat her. The flag rises and falls, signalling the start of the match.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know who you are,&#x201D; she says as she raises her sabre, &#x201C;but I will not be defeated by some rogue that does not even dare show his face. If you are a real man, why don&#x2019;t you fight without that silly mask?&#x201D; You cock your head to one side, miming her yapping mouth with your hand near your piggy ears. Then, you effect a yawn and beckon at her to come with one finger.<br>
<br>
Nie Mudan bristles at her failed taunt and throws no more words at you. She throws her sabre instead.<br>
<br>
The curved weapon spins towards you. Drawing your sword, you deflect it, sending it circling up into the air. With a soaring jump, Nie Mudan grabs the sabre and chops downwards at you in one fluid movement. You parry her attack just in time, but the girl uses the force of your strike to leap away without her feet even touching the ground.<br>
<br>
Behind you. You turn and block, but even as the blades clash she is already twirling away, moving around you for another attack.<br>
<br>
The sabre slashes come fast and furious, never from the same position twice. Nie Mudan circles you with each attack. As you move to the side to get into position for defense, attempting to circle her in return, the two of you whirl across the ring, crossing blades constantly.<br>
<br>
Nie Mudan&#x2019;s sabre technique is quick and powerful; you continue to find few flaws to exploit, and the spinning is starting to make you dizzy. You come to a sudden stop. Grabbing the hilt of your sword with both hands, you swing wildly. The amateurish, unrefined move is easy for her to predict and parry, but she has underestimated your strength. You hit hard enough to knock the sabre from her hand, sending it clattering across the ground.<br>
<br>
She recovers quickly. With a twirl, she draws the spear and sends it hurtling towards you. The precision of her strike is stunning &#x2013; the spearhead hits the guard of your sword, wrenching it from your hand. Nie Mudan does not give you any time to pick up your fallen weapon, as she launches into a quick series of consecutive thrusts. You barely manage to evade her attacks by the skin of your teeth.<br>
<br>
Feinting to the left, you step aside to the right to close in, but Nie Mudan casually swings her spear sideways. The shaft slams into your side, sending you stumbling.<br>
<br>
Your opponent retracts the spear and follows through with alarming speed. The blunted spearhead is aimed straight for the center of your body. You find your footing quickly and sidestep again. The spear drags at your clothes, passing a hair&#x2019;s breadth away from your skin.<br>
<br>
This is your chance. Before she can pull the spear back, you clamp it under your arm. Clenching your fist, you bring it down hard on the wooden shaft, breaking the spear. To Nie Mudan&#x2019;s credit, she does not waste any time. Even as she drops the broken spear, she has already drawn her sword and leapt towards you in a lunging stab. You grab hold of the spear head and defend yourself.<br>
<br>
Her sword is much faster than her sabre, though it has less strength behind it. The quick moves are familiar &#x2013; you remember Rong Zhiyu utilizing something similar in your deathmatch against him. Unlike his wild slashes, however, Nie Mudan&#x2019;s swordplay is more refined and controlled even in its ferocity. She allows you little room to maneuver. Parrying a blow with the spearhead, you put some more distance between yourself and the Huashan swordswoman.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ha, are you scared?&#x201D; she taunts, slightly out of breath. Her clothes have gotten slightly loose and dishevelled from her quick attacks. Your head is beginning to buzz slightly too &#x2013; you wonder if is due to the Yuhua Duqing Palm &#x2013; but perhaps outlasting her could be a good tactic, as long as you manage to continue evading. At any rate, you have not used any of your techniques either. Making use of your qinggong now would definitely take her by surprise.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You play keep away and go on the defensive, trying to make Nie Mudan tire herself out. You have no plans to show off your qinggong right now to anyone who might be watching. Even if you lose, you think it will be better for you to keep your trump cards a secret.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You use your Kuanglang Step and go on the offensive. All you need to do is succeed in a surprise attack to disarm her. Once she is without her sword your victory is assured. Winning is more important here than hiding your techniques.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>This calls for devious cunning instead of brute force. You go for the strip &#x2013; her dangling waist sash is an easy target. Stripping your opponent is not explicitly allowed by tournament rules, but it is not disallowed either. In fact, they don&#x2019;t mention it at all. She&#x2019;ll never see it coming.

            <h3>十六 · Second Night of the Tournament</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Second Night of the Tournament</span></b><br>
<br>
As you slowly back away from Nie Mudan, her confidence grows. Seeing weakness, she eagerly springs at you. You duck under her attack and retaliate with a strike of your palm. She dodges to one side, her sash trailing&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Your fingers close around the silken fabric.<br>
<br>
Then, you tug at it.<br>
<br>
It comes undone easily enough. As Nie Mudan raises her sword to slash at you, her robes fall open, no longer held together by the scarlet sash that is now in your hand. Her eyes widen as you are afforded a glimpse of her undergarments. With a shrill, girlish shriek, she drops her sword to pull her robes together, hiding her pale, soft skin from your view. Nie Mudan crouches down, her face flush with embarrassment and anger.<br>
<br>
You hold the sash up, looking at it and back at her, before giving her a mock bow of apology. Much of the crowd is laughing and whistling, but there are also shouts of outrage and indignation from the Huashan disciples. Standing a safe distance away from Nie Mudan, you relax into a casual stance. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t fight like this, you scoundrel!&#x201D; she mutters, her eyes brimming with tears as she clutches her clothes even more tightly. She knows your intentions. &#x201C;Fine, I surrender! I give up!&#x201D; shouts Nie Mudan indignantly.<br>
<br>
The gong is sounded &#x2013; it looks like the judges have decided to award you with the win despite your rather unorthodox way of claiming victory. You walk over to Nie Mudan, preparing to hand her the sash.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a hand snatches it from your grasp.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian plucks the sash from you with ease as he glides towards his upset junior, having leapt towards the stage with his qinggong. The very picture of elegance and gentility, he gives her the sash before draping his outer robes over her to cover her shame. The crowd breaks out into loud cheers for him as he does so. There are screams of delight from many of the female audience members. His name is being chanted repeatedly, and there are occasional shouts for him to kick your ass. In an instant, he&#x2019;s gained their adulation, reminding them that he is their former champion.<br>
<br>
He <i>does </i>look the part of a dashing hero far more than you ever will, you must admit.<br>
<br>
As the Huashan disciple turns towards you, you see that he appears to be upset.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perverted Man Tiger Pig,&#x201D; he calls out. &#x201C;The committee has deemed your method to be permissible, but in my personal standing as a senior disciple of Huashan and former champion of the tournament, I must register my disapproval with your tactics. I would have you apologize to my junior for your rudeness, but this tournament is greater than any personal grudge. I merely hope that in the future, if you still have any enmity towards Huashan, you do not take it out on my innocent juniors in such perverted ways.&#x201D; With that, he scoops up the blushing Nie Mudan in his arms and exits the stage to the cheers of the crowd.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, remind me again&#x2026; what is this all about?&#x201D; you sigh. You had spent some time wandering about the city after the match to seek news of the people-in-black. Though you had not been able to meet them again, you have heard that they were continuing to attack people under the name of Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple. When you returned to your room you had found a small banquet going on without you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m renting it out to you. I can do whatever I want,&#x201D; grins Qilin. She had invited Cao&#x2019;er, Yifang, Murong Yandi, Guo Fu and his wife  to come over under her real identity, claiming to be a friend of Guan Shide&#x2019;s. The tricky Miao girl has continued to keep her disguise as Xiaoxiang secret while progressing in the competition &#x2013; you have heard that her Wudang opponent bowed out due to a touch of mild sickness that seems to have started spreading amongst some of the pugilists.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Impure&#x2026; you are impure&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Yifang as she begins praying upon seeing your face. Cao&#x2019;er, on the other hand, is looking at you like a snake would a rat. Her fingers float up to her waist sash, toying with the knot.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Young Master Guan, we do not mean to intrude,&#x201D; says Murong Yandi, &#x201C;but my master came to me after the competition and had harsh words for me. He suggested that if I had made more friends, I would not have looked like such a fool out there. Coincidentally, Miss Chi came along afterwards, though when she made her invitation I was under the impression that it was your idea.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You glare at Qilin, who sticks out her tongue at you. Giving in, you sigh loudly and take your seat. Guo Fu greets you heartily, happy to see you. His wife, Pu&#x2019;er, bows politely, as she hands you a bowl of rice. You look at the rice suspiciously, wondering if Qilin had added anything to it.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, Guo Fu had beat Murong Yandi. The swordsman had broken his sword against Guo Fu&#x2019;s body, and in the end had tired himself out in a long match in which he could not find a way to knock out the big man. Guo Fu was not shy about revealing his technique &#x2013; it was the famous Jinzhongzhao (&#x91D1;&#x949F;&#x7F69;, Golden Bell Vest), a Shaolin neigong that could grant its user near invulnerability. He had learnt it from a mysterious wandering monk who had helped him save Pu&#x2019;er from the clutches of a corrupt official collaborating with bandits.<br>
<br>
Thus, instead of fighting Murong Yandi tomorrow, as you had expected, you would be facing Guo Fu.<br>
<br>
For his part, Murong Yandi did not seem too upset about his loss, only that his teacher had berated him for his one-man performance against Taishan.<br>
<br>
Qilin suddenly gets up. Walking behind you, she places her fingers gently under your chin. &#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D; you growl.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Were you hit by something poisonous?&#x201D; she asks, frowning. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s something off about your complexion.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x201D; You had been hit by the Yuhua Duqing Palm, but you are not sure if you should tell her. You had originally planned to head out again at night to track down the people-in-black, but this could be difficult with a bunch of acquaintances in the way. You would have to wait until they were gone, or&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You share your knowledge with them and attempt to discuss the current situation with them to see if they have any insight.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do not say anything. You will head out alone to seek out more information about the people-in-black after they have left the room.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You do not say anything. After they have left, you take the time to recuperate and instead prepare for tomorrow&#x2019;s battles.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You do not say anything for now. You will approach Qilin later and consult her about this situation you find yourself in.

            <h3>十七 · Day of the Tournament Semifinals</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Day of the Tournament Semifinals</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was attacked by someone claiming to be Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I must have been poisoned then. Haven&#x2019;t you heard of the attacks?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin shrugs. &#x201C;I have, but they are really none of my concern.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t my husband,&#x201D; says Pu&#x2019;er quickly, anxious to clear Guo Fu&#x2019;s name. She must be sensitive about the allegations thrown at him. &#x201C;You know that, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give the pair a reassuring nod. &#x201C;Of course. If it had been him I wouldn&#x2019;t be sitting here right now. I know that you have been inconvenienced by the rumours of Zhang Jue&#x2019;s apprentice. Have you noticed anything strange recently, Madam Guo?&#x201D; She seems unwilling to talk, but surprisingly it is Guo Fu that speaks up in his calm, slow manner. &#x201C;We were attacked by people last night claiming to be from an orthodox sect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That can&#x2019;t be,&#x201D; interrupts Yifang in surprise. &#x201C;Anyone fighting would be cast out of their sect. No one would risk it! Do you know which sect they were from?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Guo Fu shakes his head. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know which. They did not say. Still, I managed to fight them off. That is partially why we are here tonight. It is safer for Pu&#x2019;er.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You briefly wonder if Qilin knew about this when she invited the two, but quickly discard the idea. She wouldn&#x2019;t be that kind, would she? &#x201C;You can stay here for the night if you want,&#x201D; you offer, glancing at the one you are renting the room from. She doesn&#x2019;t seem perturbed by the idea. &#x201C;After all, I&#x2019;m already paying for the room. Two more people won&#x2019;t matter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, we can&#x2019;t.&#x201D; Pu&#x2019;er shakes her head. &#x201C;That would be too much hospitality from you, Young Master Guan. Besides, it might get you into trouble.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m already in trouble,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;A bit more won&#x2019;t matter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let us accept their kindness, Pu&#x2019;er,&#x201D; says Guo Fu. &#x201C;Just for tonight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But you are fighting Young Master Guan tomorrow!&#x201D; argues his wife fervently. &#x201C;What if-&#x201C; Too late, she realizes the insinuation of her words. She looks at you, horrified and shamed. &#x201C;I am sorry! I didn&#x2019;t mean to imply any untrustworthiness on your part!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about it,&#x201D; you say, waving off her concerns. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s expected.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I must apologize on my wife&#x2019;s behalf.&#x201D; Guo Fu bows his head. &#x201C;It is my fault for being too gullible. She has had to keep an eye out for me all this while, so she is rather sensitive about such matters.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I said not to worry about it,&#x201D; you grin cheerfully while slapping the big guy on the back. &#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If&#x2026; if it is a concern,&#x201D; Murong Yandi speaks up, &#x201C;perhaps I may be of help. Let me watch over Guo Fu and his wife. It is not like I have anything else to do. They can continue staying at their place. I think this is what my Master would want me to do&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is great,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll help you out and we can take turns.&#x201D; If there is an attack tonight, it could be a chance for you to capture one of the assailants and interrogate them, no matter if they are connected to the mysterious people-in-black, or if they truly are orthodox sect pugilists.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, you won&#x2019;t be doing that,&#x201D; says Qilin airily. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll be staying right here. You want to get rid of the poison, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is it going to take that long? I think Cao&#x2019;er already knows how to remove it.&#x201D; You turn to Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;I think it was the Yuhua Duqing Palm. You&#x2019;ve seen it before, right?&#x201D; She peers at you closely, and then shakes her head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;it&#x2019;s similar, but different. Not the same attack Granddad healed you from&#x2026; the qi is crueller&#x2026; more persistent.&#x201D; She doesn&#x2019;t seem to be able to articulate what exactly is different, but you will have to accept her diagnosis that it isn&#x2019;t the Yuhua Duqing Palm.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yuhua Duqing&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Qilin, blushing slightly. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know you were the sort to eat, shoot and leave without paying. How scandalous.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never even been there,&#x201D; you sigh. &#x201C;But enough about that. I need to find these black-clothed weirdos. Don&#x2019;t tell me you aren&#x2019;t curious.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I <i>am</i>, but&#x2026;&#x201D; Qilin pauses and thinks. &#x201C;No, we won&#x2019;t accomplish anything by running around at night trying to find them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why not?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Luoyang is too big and there are too many possible targets for them to attack. They could be anywhere. Even with a hundred of us, you would have to get lucky to encounter them again. You are better off resting tonight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That doesn&#x2019;t sound like much of a plan.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s advice. Sound advice, coming from an adult such as myself who thinks more clearly,&#x201D; she grins. &#x201C;Besides, why do you care if they start spoiling Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple&#x2019;s name?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps you should care too, seeing as you are fighting a mysterious masked fighter in the next round,&#x201D; you retort. &#x201C;With luck, they could turn out to be related, and you could end up in trouble too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t worry too much about that,&#x201D; says Qilin dismissively. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t really plan to go up against her seriously anyway... it would be more trouble than it is worth. I&#x2019;ve already completed my mission successfully and gathered enough information to work with.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Her?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, a woman can sniff out another woman easily. My nose is particularly sensitive. Besides, I already spied on them fighting during the preliminaries &#x2013; they are definitely foreign-trained. I&#x2019;m not sure why they are here, of course, or why they&#x2019;re hiding themselves.&#x201D; It looks like Qilin has come to the same conclusion that Cao&#x2019;er has from her own experience.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How do you know that?&#x201D; asks Murong Yandi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In my family business we encounter all sorts of people,&#x201D; says Qilin unabashedly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen their style before&#x2026; it is Persian. Really, all of you should get out and see more of the world. Whatever it is, I doubt they&#x2019;re connected to Yuhua Hall of all places.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After a while, Guo Fu and Pu&#x2019;er take their leave &#x2013; the girl appears to be getting tired after a long day. Murong Yandi goes with them, making good on his word to guard them. You are left in the room with Qilin, Cao&#x2019;er and Yifang, having finally convinced the Miao girl to help you keep an eye on Nameless.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, aren&#x2019;t you leaving?&#x201D; you say impatiently.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We still have to treat the poison in your body,&#x201D; says Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How do you plan on doing that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You must be feeling numb right about now, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; smiles Qilin nastily. &#x201C;I took special care with your bowl. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been mixed up with theirs. Of course, I had to up the dose to make sure you weren&#x2019;t going to secretly run out on us to don your silly mask and prowl the rooftops after you started talking about mysterious criminals. Didn&#x2019;t notice, did you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why&#x2026; do you need&#x2026; to paralyze me&#x2026; for treatment?&#x201D; You force out the words, resigned to your fate.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I didn&#x2019;t originally plan it for treatment.&#x201D; Qilin gives Cao&#x2019;er a slight nod. &#x201C;I owed her a favour. But I think we can do that another day, can&#x2019;t we?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er nods in return. &#x201C;&#x2026;Jing won&#x2019;t be in good condition if he is poisoned. I&#x2019;ll wait till he is recovered.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are the two of you doing?&#x201D; says Yifang fearfully.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right!&#x201D; says Qilin cheerfully, energetic despite the hours growing late. &#x201C;Little nun,&#x201D; she calls out, &#x201C;you might want to look away if you don&#x2019;t want to break your vows.&#x201D; Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er begin stripping your paralyzed body, peeling away the layers of garments you have on you. The both of them are clumsy about it, though Cao&#x2019;er is giving off some rather concerning giggles as she does so. Yifang begins chanting a sutra loudly, her eyes shut tight against the impure activities taking place in front of her.<br>
<br>
As you are rendered topless, Qilin gives a whistle of appreciation. &#x201C;Looks like someone has been keeping himself in shape&#x2026; and what&#x2019;s with these scars?&#x201D; She runs her fingers lightly across your scarred back in wonder. &#x201C;Did you get it while training with Zhang Jue?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;no, it was already like that when I first met Jing&#x2026;&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er. You certainly can&#x2019;t reply anymore.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Interesting,&#x201D; muses Qilin. She flicks your back hard. &#x201C;Now, Cao&#x2019;er, shall we begin?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, you feel much better on the day of the semifinals. Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s less than tender ministrations were strangely effective, though it seemed to tire them out rather quickly. They had spent the rest of the night in Qilin&#x2019;s room, dragging Yifang along with them &#x2013; the poor nun seemed rather dazed after your treatment was over, probably having succumbed to temptation and sneaking some peeks at the procedure.<br>
<br>
When you arrive, Qilin is already in her Xiaoxiang disguise and has blended into the crowd smoothly. She claims to have a plan in place to unmask Nameless, but isn&#x2019;t telling you anything about it for now. You wonder if you should seek her out and offer any help you can. Murong Yandi and Guo Fu haven&#x2019;t arrived either &#x2013; they could just be late, but you are slightly concerned that they may have run into trouble.<br>
<br>
Before you can decide what to do, however, Yifang walks up to you, her face blushing furiously as she remembers the events of last night.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-I bring word from the Abbess. She, Grand Taoist Zhengchong, and Abbot Fangzhang have summoned you. It&#x2019;s about what you said last night.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You told them?&#x201D; You stare at her. All of them had agreed to keep it a secret last night, including Yifang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course I told them. It is only right that we refer to their wisdom in such matters,&#x201D; replies Yifang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You promised,&#x201D; you point out, grinning slightly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-well, I&#x2026; anyway, I told and that was it! I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201D; She looks even more similar to Cao&#x2019;er when she pouts, finding no way to reconcile breaking her promise and her duties to the Eight Sects. It is not too much of a problem for you &#x2013; you had expected her to inform the Abbess, at least, but Miecao bringing in the heads of Wudang and Shaolin is something you had not predicted. Still, you wonder if you should heed the summons.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You head off to try and help Qilin with her plan against Nameless before their fight. You are intrigued by this Persian fighter, and would like to see what you can uncover. They must have a reason for appearing in masks.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You are slightly concerned that Murong and Guo are still not here. You head out to find them, hoping that they have not gotten into trouble. The people harassing Guo Fu cannot be ruled out as being connected to the ones in black.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You heed the summons of the Abbess. This is not something you can turn down lightly, and an excellent opportunity for you to finally meet the two strongest martial artists in person. They might know something you don&apos;t.

            <h3>十八 · Meeting with the Masters</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Meeting with the Masters</b></span><br>
<br>
At the inn where the sect&#x2019;s masters are staying, you knock on the door to announce your presence. The Abbess&#x2019;s voice comes from within, giving you permission to enter. You do so. Inside the room, Abbess Miecao is sitting together with an old Taoist and an elderly monk &#x2013; they look to be roughly her age. To your surprise, the Beggar Sect&#x2019;s Chief is also there, his ever-present gourd in his hand. You give them a deep bow, your hands placed together in a respectful salute. &#x201C;Xu Jing, disciple of Zhang Jue, pays his respects to his venerable elders.&#x201D; You doubt that they would not know of your real identity.<br>
<br>
The monk &#x2013; Abbot Fangzhang &#x2013; frowns. &#x201C;Wait, what&#x2019;s this? That kid actually produced such a polite apprentice?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Miecao nods. &#x201C;Yes. It was rather surprising. I suppose he was born polite and Zhang Jue couldn&#x2019;t beat it out of him, though he uses it well enough as a weapon.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Grand Taoist Wang Zhengchong eyes you for a moment, and then chuckles. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t buy that. You are only polite to those you think will react better to politeness, aren&#x2019;t you? I doubt you are <i>naturally </i>polite.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it the proper way to communicate with people as they wish to be communicated with? A bit of politeness goes a long way,&#x201D; you respond. &#x201C;Exactly right,&#x201D; grins Qi Liuwu, who seems to be very slightly drunk already even if it is only morning. He tosses the gourd at you, which you catch nimbly. &#x201C;Which is why you should drink that. This is not a place to stand on ceremony.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure what you mea-&#x201C; You begin, but the grandmaster of Wudang cuts you off with a laugh. &#x201C;It means if you don&#x2019;t take a good gulp you&#x2019;ll be disrespecting us. This is not a place to stand on ceremony.&#x201D; You stare at him and shrug, before taking a good swig from the gourd. It is rather good. You wonder how a beggar affords such good wine. Then, you heed his words and sit down without being invited to. The old men grin approvingly, though Abbess Miecao just sighs.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, what&#x2019;s this all about?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nothing much, really,&#x201D; says Wang. &#x201C;We were just curious as to how Jue&#x2019;s disciple would turn out.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s all?&#x201D; You don&#x2019;t believe that they&#x2019;d have called you in just to take a look at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not,&#x201D; snaps Miecao. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s that matter of the people pretending to be you, going around attacking people in the streets.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is a rather silly thing to do,&#x201D; sighs Qi Liuwu. &#x201C;If it was a show targeted at us, it was a bit ignorant.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course it was,&#x201D; grunts Abbot Fangzhang in annoyance. &#x201C;Zhang Jue wouldn&#x2019;t have his disciple assault random, no-name disciples on the street. I know the kid well, he&#x2019;d be a bit more arrogant about it, like sending his disciple out to beat down all of our best students at once. That&#x2019;s more his style. Idiots might buy it but I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; You attempt to change the topic. &#x201C;I am curious &#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t sound like you have much bad blood with my master, from the way you talk about him. I would have thought that the orthodox sects would hate him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Wang Zhengchong replies solemnly. &#x201C;Your master is a killer and a dangerous man, there is no doubt about that, but there is not one of us here who has not taken a life in the past. It is not our place to judge his way of martial arts. As far as I know, he only uses his power on those already involved in the pugilistic world. When you step into the <i>jianghu</i>, you must be ready to risk your life whether you walk the orthodox or unorthodox path. Of course, in the orthodox sects we try to minimize that risk and avoid pointless loss of life, but the danger is still present. His methods are cruel but not entirely out of place. Besides, as his former masters we cannot lay the blame entirely on him&#x2026; but that is not a story that concerns us today.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What the longwinded old fart means,&#x201D; interrupts Qi, &#x201C;is that everyone has their own path and we won&apos;t judge them outright without looking at the circumstances. I mean, take a look at me. I&#x2019;m a beggar, but before this I was a prince. You have read about the civil war thirty years ago, right? It was before your time, but that war brought the current Emperor to power.&#x201D; It is not spoken of much nowadays, as the Emperor had been keen to make his rule appear more legitimate by suppressing talk of him having seized power from his siblings by force, but you know of the war. You nod.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Lots of my brothers died back then. I was a minor prince, never in contention for the throne, but I saw enough to walk away from it all. Now, the <i>point </i>I&#x2019;m trying to make is, in the pugilistic world we should never try to judge a book by its cover, whether we are orthodox or unorthodox. There are always factors to consider.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But the orthodox sects tend to act self-righteous and lord it over those not in a sect,&#x201D; you point out bluntly. They did say that you should not stand on ceremony.<br>
<br>
Wang Zhengchong sighs. &#x201C;Yes, that is a problem I have started to see recently. Those of us who fought against the Tujue in the war forty years ago, and in the subsequent civil war ten years later &#x2013; we know what happens when ideals try to shape reality, or when pragmatism goes too far. We&#x2019;ve tried to find a balance since then by guarding the country as best as we can, but I am unsure if it is working out well.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I am slightly ashamed to say this,&#x201D; grumbles Fangzhang, &#x201C;but even as the sect heads we cannot reach everyone. You can only teach those willing to learn.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shouldn&#x2019;t you lead by example?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Tried that,&#x201D; shrugs Wang. &#x201C;Sure, they listened for a while, but once my back is turned they begin acting up again. For example, that business with Shunshi.&#x201D; The old Taoist frowns. &#x201C;Never liked that hypocrite Song Jiangke. He tried to stiff me once when he lost a bet.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You know Master Yao?&#x201D; You aren&#x2019;t too surprised by this, seeing that the Abbess seems to be on good terms with them, and that Master Yao already has an acquaintance with Qi Liuwu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, we met during the war. All of us did,&#x201D; says the Abbot. &#x201C;That sneaky little bastard Song Jiangke deserved what was coming to him. He <i>knew </i>Shunshi had his price.&#x201D; He is being surprisingly bloodthirsty for a monk.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a good thing I&#x2019;m a beggar and don&#x2019;t need to bother with all of these silly hang-ups about reputation,&#x201D; laughs Qi Liuwu. &#x201C;Maybe you guys should resign your positions. Then you could go about beating up those hypocritical gentlemen running your sects.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That would just cause more troubles, but don&#x2019;t think for a second I haven&#x2019;t been tempted to knock some sense into them in the past ten years, Liuwu,&#x201D; grumbles Wang. &#x201C;Unfortunately the generation after ours is lost. They have reached that age where they think they are wiser than their elders and more experienced than their juniors. We need to let the younger generation take the lead here. Besides, cleaning house now would mean all the burden of running the sect falls on us again, and possibly disastrous to the other members of the Eight Sects where they don&#x2019;t have leaders ready to step up. I mean, I don&#x2019;t want to have to end up running <i>their </i>sects for them too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait, you mean in the end you aren&#x2019;t doing it because you&#x2019;re lazy?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-well- not exactly. As I said, I do not judge the path that people take. Persuading people by force is not really my way.&#x201C; the Grand Taoist falters as he gives his excuse. After this meeting, you think the dignity and reputation of the Eight Sects&#x2019; grandmasters will never be the same in your eyes again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ha! The boy got you there, Zhengchong,&#x201D; grins Fangzhang. &#x201C;I run a tighter ship at the temple, but perhaps you should begin paying more attention to things going on around you, my dear Taoist friend. Still, we are all only human. Boy, please forgive us our weaknesses and sins.&#x201D; He takes a long good drink of wine, certainly breaking the monastic prohibition against alcohol without shame.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If Xuzhan saw this&#x2026;&#x201D; you murmur to yourself.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I heard that someone fitting your description led them out of the red-lantern district. Now why did you do that, after I had painstakingly given them the directions there in the first place?&#x201D; says the venerable Abbot of Shaolin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean&#x2026; they weren&#x2019;t lost?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, sure,&#x201D; snorts Fangzhang. &#x201C;They <i>think </i>they were lost because the great grand Abbot would never give them directions to a den of lustful sin. I say that a monk must seek out temptations and fight them. Cloistering yourself in a monastery makes you weak.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As I recall,&#x201D; muses Wang, &#x201C;back in the day you never even made an effort to beat temptation after shaving your head. What was that the girls at Yuhua Hall used to call you? Iron Shaft? I <i>distinctly </i>remember you showing off the Jinzhongzhao by having them attack your-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shut up, damn Taoist bastard,&#x201D; snarls the Abbot, &#x201C;you weren&#x2019;t much better, what with your Taiji F-.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Abbess Miecao slams her palm on the table, cracking it. &#x201C;That is very much enough out of you idiots,&#x201D; she says coldly. &#x201C;Can we get to the actual topic of discussion now and stop shaming yourselves in front of those who are supposed to look up to you?&#x201D; You think it is a little too late now for them to regain any form of dignity.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right,&#x201D; coughs Wang Zhengchong. &#x201C;About Yuhua Hall&#x2026; I believe that has something to do with the current situation?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; nods Miecao. &#x201C;Yifang told me that Xu Jing seems to have been hit by something similar, and it was not the first time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I doubt they are actually involved,&#x201D; says Wang. &#x201C;The Madame of Yuhua Hall is a personal friend of ours. They do not get involved in matters of the pugilistic world, as a rule. I suspect if there is any connection, it is via a rogue courtesan, but of course we have not had much contact with her recently.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We could change that,&#x201D; says the Abbot, slightly too eagerly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think,&#x201D; you say slowly, &#x201C;that having the Shaolin Abbot walk into a brothel might really shock certain people.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The boy speaks sense,&#x201D; says Miecao, &#x201C;so stop acting like fools for a while and be serious. We can deal with Yuhua Hall later. Now, why do you think they used Zhang Jue&#x2019;s name in attacking our people?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Rather simple in my opinion,&#x201D; says Qi, &#x201C;they merely wanted to unite the orthodox sects against him. I suspect that we have someone in our ranks working with these mysterious assailants. Xu Jing obtaining that invite was not a matter of coincidence.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I agree,&#x201D; says the Grand Taoist, turning to you. &#x201C;They wanted you here. As the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s disciple they had expected you to act like your master, walking in brazenly and possibly maiming one or two arrogant fools who decide to bite off more than they can chew. They were probably prepared to provoke you into doing something foolish.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But when you didn&#x2019;t appear,&#x201D; he continues, stroking his beard, &#x201C;they decided to fall back on another plan. I hear someone else is rumoured to be Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple &#x2013; a rather promising lad by the name of Guo Fu. Of course, the boy looks like he wouldn&#x2019;t hurt a fly, not on purpose at least, but with the right triggers he could be made to serve their purpose. At the very least, they are trying to stoke outrage against Jue. And if they succeed&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There would be people seeking to band together and bring him down by force of numbers, citing him as a threat to the pugilistic community?&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Exactly that,&#x201D; beams Qi Liuwu. &#x201C;But what would happen if they attacked Zhang? How do you think your master would react?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He&#x2019;d slaughter most of them. No offense, elders, but besides the people here in this room, I doubt there are many that could defeat him. My master is strong.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That he is,&#x201D; says Fangzhang. &#x201C;That kid has always been a brutal fighter. He has absolutely no understanding of the concept of holding back.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And when that happens,&#x201D; says Miecao, &#x201C;the leaders of the Eight Sects would be forced to act. After all, we are the only ones that can bring him down, but I am afraid at that point they would ask for his head&#x2026; I see. This could be what they are aiming for.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But why do that?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;What is the purpose of it all?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Unfortunately I&#x2019;m not sure about that,&#x201D; says Wang. &#x201C;They could have some deeper motive for doing so, but it is out of my calculations for now. When it comes to that point, it would be impossible for us to talk them down, not even with our influence, but I would not wish to kill Jue over something I know that was ultimately not his fault. I think it is more important that we do not let things progress to that stage.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I agree,&#x201D; says Qi. &#x201C;For now I will have my beggars gather any information they can. Do you have anything else that can help us, Jing?&#x201D; You wonder if you should reveal the initial encounter with the woman-in-black, and the attempt on Shun&#x2019;s life, but decide against it. You are not yet willing to reveal any part of your connection to the Imperial Palace &#x2013; that might drastically change their behaviour towards you. You shake your head, and the beggar chief nods. &#x201C;Then that&#x2019;ll be it for now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We might need you to reveal your identity during the tournament, if things get to the point where we feel they may begin rounding up people for an assault on your master. We will vouch for you if necessary,&#x201D; says Wang abruptly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure that is okay?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I am sure you can think up a suitably theatrical way to do so.&#x201D; His eyes twinkle with amusement. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve brought the most fun to the tournament in years. I am glad I decided to visit this time around. Usually we don&#x2019;t bother. Too many years of that insufferably uptight Huashan prig winning. I swear, he and his master are cut from the same cloth.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They <i>are </i>upright men, are they not?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s such a thing as being too upright,&#x201D; says the Grand Taoist. Then, he adds darkly, &#x201C;When upright men push their righteousness too far, they tend to get people killed for their own ideals, from my experience.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you suspect something about them?&#x201D; you probe.<br>
<br>
The Abbot laughs when he hears your question. &#x201C;Never trust a guy so clean that his clothes shine. We don&apos;t get to live to our age without learning that. Unfortunately, we can&#x2019;t interfere directly with other sects, or I&#x2019;d give that Bai Jiutian a spanking to loosen his spine a bit.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps I can give it on your behalf,&#x201D; you offer with a sly grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Fangzhang&#x2019;s eyes gleam. &#x201C;Now that would be interesting to watch.&#x201D; There is a similar glint of interest in Wang Zhengchong&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201C;Yes, I do remember something about your match against Emei&#x2019;s Yiling,&#x201D; says the Taoist suddenly. &#x201C;Are you actually using Zhang Jue&#x2019;s neigong, the Wushuang Bawang Skill (&#x7121;&#x96D9;&#x9738;&#x738B;&#x529F;, Peerless Conqueror Skill)? I don&#x2019;t think so, right? It felt different.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You hesitate to tell the Grand Taoist, but with a blur of his hand he hurls a cup at you. You instinctively reach to grab it before it smashes, but as your fingers close around the cup, you find that Wang Zhengchong&#x2019;s hand has gripped your wrist. You feel him pouring energy into you, probing the depths of your inner strength. Unlike Master Zhang&#x2019;s qi, the Grand Taoist&#x2019;s is calm and still, almost imperceptible in its flow despite its vastness.<br>
<br>
Your Yuanshi Hundun rises uncontrollably, attempting to repel the intruding qi. Wang Zhengchong&#x2019;s eyes widen as he lets go of your wrist. Then, he laughs loudly. &#x201C;Of all the things to discover today, this is the best! I have been meditating for the past ten years for an answer as to whether anything lies beyond the Way, and today it has appeared in front of me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The other old people in the room stare at him. &#x201C;Well, no stopping him once he gets like that,&#x201D; mutters Fangzhang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Wang Zhengchong excitedly, &#x201C;do you have any idea what you possess?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Uh,&#x201D; you reply nervously, &#x201C;a heresy to the Way? That is what Master Zhang said.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hah, that is what he would say. No, this is an answer to my prayers. The heavens smile upon me. This is something I have been seeking for decades, something to push the boundaries of knowledge in our universe!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And&#x2026; what does that mean, exactly?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have absolutely no idea,&#x201D; says the Grand Taoist with a straight face, &#x201C;I need to meditate for a few more years to grasp the magnitude of this discovery.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait,&#x201C; begins Miecao, &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t be-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be leaving things in your hands, my friends,&#x201D; says Wang Zhengchong as he gets up. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be returning to Mount Wudang to meditate in seclusion. Farewell!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, the Grand Taoist is gone, leaving behind an open window.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh no, not again,&#x201D; grumbles Miecao. &#x201C;The last time he did that he didn&#x2019;t come out for ten years. Anyway, it looks like this meeting is over, since the supposed leader of the pugilistic world has left the building. We&#x2019;ll update you if anything important turns up, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She gets up and leaves the room. The Abbot leaves next, but not before giving you a smile of approval and whispering, &#x201C;Good job with the stripping, lad.&#x201D; Finally, Qi Liuwu comes to you. &#x201C;Have you been practicing the Xianglong Palms that I taught you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give him a non-committal gesture. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s only one move, Master Qi, though it is a useful one.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He looks puzzled. &#x201C;But I showed you the full set!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Unfortunately,&#x201D; you say humbly, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not smart or perceptive enough to pick up the entire set in just one glimpse.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is a shame,&#x201D; sighs the beggar chief. He looks around him furtively, then throws you a grin. &#x201C;Well, there is no one around right now, kiddo, so&#x2026;&#x201D;

            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tournament Quarterfinals: Guo Fu</span></b><br>
<br>
By the time you make your way back to the tournament area, Qilin&#x2019;s match is over.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Feeling alright?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, <i>you </i>are being concerned about <i>me</i>?&#x201D; Qilin flutters her eyelashes, though the effect is much lessened in her plain disguise. &#x201C;Amazing. The stupid boy has a heart after all. This is a day to be remembered!&#x201D; She had lost her match rather quickly, whatever plan she had failing to work out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not like I feel bad about it or anything. I didn&#x2019;t beg you to help. You could have turned me down,&#x201D; you say quickly. &#x201C;I only want to make sure I won&#x2019;t get hit by whatever it is that beat you.&#x201D; Qilin chuckles softly, before telling you what you came here to find out. &#x201C;Well, she was beyond my ability to fight in a proper duel, after my initial trap failed. I underestimated her agility and she was cunning enough not to fall for most of my tricks. That, and the tournament frowns on using snakes in a fight. The girl is good, though if you give me a week to prepare I could probably plan a <i>proper </i>plot to drug her and leave her nicely bound up in your bed. In terms of technical ability, I would put her close to Yifang&#x2019;s level. What is more problematic, however, is her neigong.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She scratches her chest, where she had apparently been hit. Qilin had been downed with one good strike a few minutes into the match.  &#x201C;I said her style was Persian, but now I can be a <i>bit </i>more specific. Her martial arts hail from a particular group&#x2026; a Zoroastrian fire cult. They have been making inroads into the Central Plains for a while, but the Eight Sects probably don&#x2019;t know about them just yet. My uncle has had dealings with this particular cult in the past. That&#x2019;s all I can tell you about. The rest are family secrets,&#x201D; she winks. &#x201C;At any rate, in a contest of neigong she could possibly beat most people here except for that big dumb ox. I doubt any of the young pugilists around have enough skill to neutralize her particular technique. Her qi is fiery and burns. In fact, I&#x2019;m still feeling a bit hot.&#x201D; As if to illustrate her point, she loosens the front of her vest and flaps it modestly enough not to reveal anything, yet open just enough to allow you a good view of her low neckline. Her eyes are daring you to look.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are just a perverted exhibitionist, aren&#x2019;t you,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re the one that was going around shirtless last night,&#x201D; she replies sweetly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Should I empty this gourd of water over your head?&#x201D; you reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I prefer to fight fire with fire. When I feel hot, I want something to hug to warm me up and comfort me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Get your snakes and toads to do that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They&#x2019;re cold-blooded, stupid boy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m leaving the water here. Cao&#x2019;er mixed some cooling powder into it,&#x201D; you say as you put down the gourd by her bed and leave the grinning girl hurriedly before she can taunt you further.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Yifang&#x2019;s match with Xuzhan had ended in a rather anticlimatic way. The young monk had found himself utterly unable to strike a girl, let alone a very beautiful one. He had frozen up in the opening seconds of the fight and found himself sitting outside the ring before he could say anything. You suppose that Abbot Fangzhang <i>does </i>have a point in monks needing to train to fight off temptation instead of avoiding it. On the other hand, you think that if Xuzhan was anything like the Abbot, Emei would be feuding with Shaolin over this match before the week was out.<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi and Guo Fu had arrived during your talk with Qilin. As it turned out, Guo Fu <i>had </i>been attacked. Thankfully the Sword Saint&#x2019;s disciple was there and fended them off with ease while Guo concentrated on protecting his wife. Between the two, and the Emei nuns that arrived in search of them, they made it to the tournament area without any further problems. Things may have gone a lot worse if Murong Yandi had not been there. He was extremely embarrassed when you thanked him for his help, but stated that you still shouldn&#x2019;t let your guard down. They may still attack after this. You would probably have to get more help from the heads of the sects to protect Guo Fu &#x2013; but you can discuss that after  today&#x2019;s matches. The conspirators don&#x2019;t seem to have tried anything within the tournament area so far.<br>
<br>
Right before your match, Qi Liuwu appears. The head of the Beggars&#x2019; Sect walks up to you with a serious face. He places his hands on your shoulders firmly, his eyes gazing at you sombrely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Abbot and I just made a bet for a lot of money. <i>Do not fail me</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are a beggar, and he is a monk. <i>What</i> money are you talking about?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Money is where you find it,&#x201D; replies Qi, &#x201C;Thus goes one of the Beggar Sect&#x2019;s creeds... I think. Now, remember, <i>don&#x2019;t lose</i>.&#x201D; He gives you a very urgent look before walking off.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Finally, it is time to face off against Guo Fu. Entering the ring with your customary pig&#x2019;s mask to the cheers of the crowd, you wave at them. There are a few more hecklers asking you to strip Guo Fu down to his bare butt. You turn to your opponent, the hulking lad who looks like he could rip you with the barest effort. He gives you a kind smile, bowing. You return the favour.<br>
<br>
As the match begins, you carefully keep your distance. Guo Fu squares off into a stable stance, awaiting you to attack. You have not had the opportunity to analyze any of his matches, but you know that he has high stamina and defensive ability, and that his strength likely rivals &#x2013; if not surpasses &#x2013; yours. Getting caught would be a problem.<br>
<br>
Guo Fu continues to wait for you, steady as a mountain. Tapping your foot twice, you shake your doubts away and spring into action. He blocks your first blow easily, raising his arm to block your punch. The counterblow comes quickly &#x2013; a kick. Leaping aside, you continue to press your attack. Guo is faster than you expected, but it is nothing you can&#x2019;t handle. Your strikes, however, do nothing.  He takes your hits straight on without even flinching. You are not fighting at full strength yet, of course.<br>
<br>
After a few exchanges, you draw back. Guo Fu still has not budged a step from his position, all through your flurry of attacks. You decide to put a bit more power behind your blows. Closing the distance again, you slide under his punch and strike him in the belly. His muscular abdomen flexes as it absorbs your blow, and Guo Fu&#x2019;s torso jerks back just slightly. He felt that one. Ducking an elbow, you strike again, but this time it does nothing. However, Guo Fu visibly concentrated and clenched his body right before you hit. Another direct hit confirms your suspicions. It seems that his Jinzhongzhao needs longer periods of preparation to summon the inner strength required to take greater hits. If you strike fast enough, hard enough&#x2026;<br>
<br>
You throw your entire body behind your next blow, sending a punch slamming straight into his abdomen. You feel Guo&#x2019;s body lift slightly into the air. He stumbles back. The crowd roars, seeing the immovable mountain budge for the first time. Your opponent is still unharmed, however. He looks at you with a smile. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re really powerful, Man Tiger Pig. I am glad to be able to fight you.&#x201D; Raising himself up to his full height, he stretches his muscular arms and takes a different stance. It looks like he will be going all out now.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re a real monster, Guo Fu,&#x201D; you mutter, smiling under your mask. He goes on the offense for the first time, rushing towards you. His attacks are slightly quicker this time, and more coordinated. Your first impression of his clumsiness seems to have been sorely mistaken. His fist techniques don&#x2019;t seem to be self-taught or anything basic, but you cannot identify the school that it is from. The punches are straight and powerful, yet his footwork travels in a circular, sliding motion.<br>
<br>
As you continue to exchange blows to no avail, your concentration begins to waver. You could do this dance all day and tire yourself out without hurting Guo Fu. Is there a way around it? You try to focus and think of a plan.<br>
<br>
Your foot slips, unluckily.<br>
<br>
Your distraction costs you.<br>
<br>
A massive fist is hurtling towards you when you snap your eyes back to Guo Fu.  Unable to evade, you raise one arm to block. With your other, you lash out with your Chuzhan Fist. You&#x2019;ll only make it in time if you use your neigong. There&#x2019;s no other choice. An agonizing pain radiates from your left forearm as the punch hits home. At the same time, your right fist smashes into Guo Fu&#x2019;s chest with all your strength, both inner and outer. The both of you are thrown away from each other. You come to a halt nearly ten paces away from where you were, while Guo Fu is knocked off his feet &#x2013; again, something that has happened for the first time in the competition. The crowd begins to cheer even more loudly.<br>
<br>
As Guo Fu stands back up, you lower your left arm. It twinges in pain &#x2013; from the sensation, the bones in your forearm are probably cracked from that hit &#x2013; they may even be broken. Guo Fu gets up and resumes his stance, though his breathing is slightly more disordered now. He <i>definitely </i>felt that blow. He still seems rather happy to be fighting you, however. You think you can understand the attraction behind going all out, without the need to hold back.<br>
<br>
Still&#x2026;<br>
<br>
The tournament official is holding his flag up, calling a pause to the match. Looking at you, he shouts, &#x201C;Are you alright, Man Tiger Pig?&#x201D; He is probably referring to the blow you took &#x2013; it looks like he has rather sharp eyes.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You claim to be alright. It&#x2019;s time to take this seriously. This is a good chance to go all out in a fight for once, in a fight against an opponent that can bring you down with a single blow. Guo Fu can take anything you can throw at him, and you should be able to improve your fighting skills if you do so. You can beat him. Besides, Cao&#x2019;er can treat you. Probably. (Sword +1, Unarmed +1)<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You claim victory by disqualifying Guo Fu for breaking your arm. You would like to advance to the finals and battle Nameless, the Persian fighter. It would be hard for you to do that if you lost now. It is unfortunate, but rules are rules and he just broke it. It would teach him the importance of holding back too.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You hide the injury and surrender the match to Guo Fu. This is as far as you go, sadly.

            <h3>二十 · Tournament Semifinals: Yifang</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tournament Semifinals: Yifang</span></b><br>
<br>
You nod at the tournament official to signal that you are fine, and turn your gaze back towards Guo Fu. He is patiently awaiting you, his hands held up in an open palm stance. You take a crouching stance in response, your back hunched over and your fingers curling into claws. Your left arm is still hurting you, but that doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter so much now. You can&#x2019;t help but grin under your mask as your fingers twitch in anticipation. Breathing in deeply, you allow your chaotic <i>qi</i> to flow through you freely. A turbulent warmth rushes forward from the center of your body and floods your extremities. You lean forward just slightly and kick off the ground without warning.<br>
<br>
Guo Fu&#x2019;s eyes widen as you cross ten paces in the blink of an eye. His massive arm shoots out in defense, but your approach is too low for him to hit. He misses the back of your head by a hair&#x2019;s breadth. Your Shouwang Claws sweep towards his leg, hitting the side of his calf. It is as if you are attempting to dig into rock. A less sturdier opponent would have been thrown off his feet by the force of your blow, but Guo remains unmoved. You tumble aside as a fist thuds into the boards that make up the stage floor. There is a crack as the wood splinters. That blow would have ended the fight if it landed. Regaining your posture before he does, you pounce to the attack again.<br>
<br>
Your claw arcs from the top and strikes him square on the shoulder, forcing one of his knees to buckle under the strength of your attack. In the next instant, however, Guo Fu throws you off with a shout. He is quick enough to follow up with a jab to your chest. That is trivial enough for you to evade, sliding under the punch. You retaliate with a Chuzhan Fist. It barrels into his abdomen, your tempestuous <i>qi</i> throwing off your aim. This time, however, Guo Fu is more prepared. Instead of being knocked down, you merely manage to force him to take two steps back.<br>
<br>
You press your advantage, stepping forward and continuing to perform the first style of the Chuzhan Fist. Your blow strikes home again, forcing him another step back. As you throw your third punch, Guo suddenly leans forward, taking your fist right in his chest. You see him visibly wince; you may have cracked a couple of his ribs with that blow.<br>
<br>
Even so, his goal is achieved. He grabs your right arm before you can retract it. With his other hand, he prepares to deliver a knockout blow.<br>
<br>
You try to tug your way out of his grasp, but he is too strong, and no amateur at grappling either. His grip is firm. His fist drives towards you. There is no more time to evade.<br>
<br>
With your left hand, you draw your sword in a reverse grip. Guo Fu&#x2019;s punch strikes the blade of the sword, pressing it hard against your injured forearm. You fancy that you can hear your bones creaking even further, the cracks widening. Still, your block is successful. Flipping the sword around, you strike at his wrist with the sword&#x2019;s hilt. The sudden attack forces him to let go. You toss your sword to your right hand and go on the offense.<br>
<br>
Within a few blows, you start to understand how frustrated Murong Yandi must have been in his fight. You are not sure whether Guo Fu is equally impervious to an actual sharp blade, but he must have immense inner strength reserves to utilize his <i>neigong</i> to such an extent. More frighteningly, the more you attack, the less effect it seems to have on him as he draws upon more and more of his <i>qi</i> &#x2013; and he doesn&#x2019;t seem to be running out any time soon. Thankfully, your unpredictable and speedy movements means that he is entirely unable to mount a proper offense as long as he doesn&#x2019;t catch you like he just did.<br>
<br>
That isn&#x2019;t going to win you the match, however. You are just going to tire yourself out like Murong Yandi did.<br>
<br>
After putting some distance between you and him, you lunge forward with the Pine-Cutting Sword. Guo Fu&#x2019;s gaze sharpens as he steadies himself and hardens his body. He shouts as your sword hits his neck. The blade breaks &#x2013; it was shoddily made anyway and you saw it coming &#x2013; but you take that chance to stop your momentum and instead swing away, striking Guo Fu on the cheek with the flat of the broken blade, stunning him for just a while.<br>
<br>
You let go of the hilt and launch an all-out attack.<br>
<br>
With just your right hand, you rain down wild claws on Guo Fu from all sides as you give yourself entirely over to your <i>neigong</i>, sacrificing precision for speed. Every time you strike, you change your clawed fingers into a gentle palm and follow up by executing the first move of the Xianglong Palms. That way, you find that you are able to control the direction and power of your subsequent claw strikes better despite your chaotic <i>neigong</i>. Given no time to recover, Guo Fu is slowly but steadily forced towards the edge of the ring, his own attacks meeting nothing but thin air as you bob and weave in between blows. His breath grows more and more ragged as your ceaseless attacks begin to disrupt his focus.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, your erratic qi slows down for just a second. You miss a step. Guo Fu does not miss the opportunity. You find yourself again in the path of his powerful fist.<br>
<br>
You will not be able to block it again. Your only option is to meet his blow with one of your own &#x2013; the only move you can perform in time is to throw your most powerful attack, the Bloody Diamond Horn, with the left arm that you had been trying not to favour.<br>
<br>
Your open hand meets his closed fist with bone-shattering force. Indeed, you do imagine you can feel the bones of your arm shatter as you do so. The pain is excruciating, but on the other hand Guo Fu is thrown back, lifted into the air by the force of your blow.<br>
<br>
You jump immediately, going after him before he can regain his balance. Drawing your right palm back, you channel all the qi you can muster and smash it down into Guo Fu&#x2019;s huge body. He slams into the floor, cracking the wood, and tumbles backwards in a noisy flurry of heavy limbs. When he comes to a stop, he has landed just outside the ring area. You drop to your knees as the gong is sounded, watching Guo Fu get to <i>his</i> knees looking extremely battered from your blows. His eyes seem to be shining with respect.<br>
<br>
&#x2026;You think you are going to need to have words with him about his stupid strength afterwards.<br>
<br>
The crowd, which had been watching in tense silence till now, breaks out into a loud roar at your victory. The sound of their exhilaration echoes around the tournament area.<br>
<br>
Then, you pass out.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When you come to, you are in the treatment area. Your broken arm has been bandaged and secured tightly. No one seems to be around. Well, no one, except for that perpetual annoyance Chi Qilin, who is still lounging around despite probably having recovered from her injuries. She grins at you, her face uncomfortably close.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You missed a lot of things while you were sleeping,&#x201D; she says.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I missed a lot of things, but not you. What are you still doing here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She pouts and pokes you hard in the broken arm. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m still recovering, you idiot. Anyway, I&#x2019;m sure you wanted to see Cao&#x2019;er. She was here just a moment ago, treating your injuries. She says that arm is not going to heal completely by tomorrow, but she will make an effort to render it usable tonight. For now, you are not to move it at all.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My next opponent is Yifang,&#x201D; you chuckle. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think I will need to.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you mean? Are you going to forfeit? Or do you have a plan?&#x201D; She looks anxious all of a sudden.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe,&#x201D; you say liltingly. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter, did you bet money on me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be such a tease!&#x201D; she fumes. &#x201C;Especially when it comes to money. What are you going to do next?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you watch and find out? By the way, who removed my mask?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She sighs as you change the subject. &#x201C;Cao&#x2019;er did. Interestingly, when the tournament officials were carrying you off,  the Huashan and Taishan disciples were jeering for you to be unmasked. Of course, when they did that there were louder calls for the mask to stay on by the rest of the crowd. Luckily for you, the tournament officials seemed more concerned with getting you to the treatment area. Cao&#x2019;er took over rather quickly. I&#x2019;ve never seen that girl so worried or so bossy before. She managed to glare the tournament officials out of the room in five seconds flat.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;m just surprised that she didn&#x2019;t wait around for me to wake up,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;of course I am around, Jing,&#x201D; whispers a voice from behind you. You can&#x2019;t help but freeze up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But-&#x201C; -you look accusingly at Qilin- &#x201C;-you said she wasn&#x2019;t here!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, not <i>my </i>fault you only have eyes for me and didn&#x2019;t notice your dear little physician standing on the other side of the bed,&#x201D; giggles Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;it&#x2019;s okay. You can have his eyes. I&#x2019;ll take&#x2026; something else&#x2026;&#x201D; mumbles Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
You spend the rest of your recuperating time being toyed with again by Cao&#x2019;er and Qilin.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Right before the semifinal match, Qi Liuwu appears again, grinning widely. &#x201C;Performed just as I expected. Excellent work, kiddo.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You raise your broken arm slightly in protest. &#x201C;I do get a part of the winnings, right? Master Qi?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah&#x2026; about that&#x2026;&#x201D; he looks away guiltily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m the one putting my body on the line out there, Master Qi.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fair enough, fair enough,&#x201D; he sighs. &#x201C;The problem is, I put all our winnings into your next match.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Great. Did you bet with Abbess Miecao this time?&#x201D; you groan.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, no. She wouldn&#x2019;t take a bet nowadays, and she said that even if she did, she would be crazy to bet on Yifang against you. Apparently it&#x2019;s not a matter of skill, but she thinks you are just naturally the worst match-up for that girl.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, the Abbot again?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. He&#x2019;s really the only one who&#x2019;ll bet with me now that Wang ran off to meditate. I&#x2019;m going to clean that old baldie up to make up for all the other bets over the years. So&#x2026; <i>please don&#x2019;t lose</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The crowd cheers louder than ever for you when you arrive on stage with your bandaged arm. You give them a wave of acknowledgement, sending them into a frenzy.<br>
<br>
This time, you are facing Yifang in the semifinals. The stage has been repaired in the downtime between matches. The pretty nun stands a fair distance away from you, her guard up. She seems calm and focused. Her gaze and stance are steady, a far cry from how she usually is, though she appears to be mumbling sutras continuously. You can tell that she would give you a good fight even when you are in perfect condition. With your broken arm and dwindling stamina, however, taking her on will be extremely difficult even if you do have a counter for her Qingcheng Stab.<br>
<br>
It is probably for times like this that you kept <i>that</i> with you&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Use Item: Yifang&#x2019;s Skull Cap<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You think you would rather fight fairly. Surely she deserves better?<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You decide to forfeit the match, citing your poor condition.

            <h3>二十一 · A Challenger Arrives</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">A Challenger Arrives</span></b><br>
<br>
Neither you nor Yifang make a move. Her sword is held steady as she keeps her focus pinned on you. The nun takes one step forward. You hold up a hand, stopping her in her tracks. As she looks on in puzzlement, you rummage around your garments. After a while, you whip out a folded, grey piece of cloth, which you hold out to her in an unmistakeably apologetic manner. Her eyes widen.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am sorry. I should not have stolen this,&#x201D; you say, soft enough that the crowd cannot hear you clearly. &#x201C;Your serious and earnest aura just now convinced me that I have erred in my ways. I see the light now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She relaxes almost instantly, a smile lighting up her face. &#x201C;That is wonderful! I am glad you have repented. Let me teach you later about the wonders of the Buddha&#x2019;s teachings!&#x201D; Yifang comes towards you to take the skull cap back, but you stop her again once she is close enough. &#x201C;Wait,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;There is one last thing I would like to do.&#x201D; Yifang looks at you with a puzzled, innocent smile. &#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Putting the skull cap to the pig&#x2019;s nose of your mask, you inhale very, very deeply before letting out a satisfied sigh. The crowd begins whistling and jeering you in good humour, laughing at your antics. Yifang&#x2019;s face turns red instantly. &#x201C;G-g-g-give that back right now, you impure pervert!&#x201D; she stammers, running towards you. You flee from her, holding the skull cap over your head.<br>
<br>
The two of you begin running in circles around the ring as she attempts to snatch back the skull cap. &#x201C;Why do you always act like this?&#x201D; she moans, clearly frustrated with your recalcitrance. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you take anything seriously?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let me guess,&#x201D; you chuckle as you duck her grasping arms, &#x201C;you thought that if you really beat me in a fight, I would listen to you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes! You are arrogant and boastful and perverted. I wanted to show you that-&#x201C; &#x2013;she attempts to grab the skull cap with a wide swing, but fails&#x2013; &#x201C;-that there is always someone better, so that you would be humbled and listen. If I beat you today&#x2026; if I just beat you today&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She comes at you with her sword, but her movements are sloppy and impatient. Her eyes are tearing up from your bullying. You suppose you shouldn&#x2019;t go too far &#x2013; you should stop before she starts crying. You dance back a few steps. Twirling the skull cap around your finger, you say, &#x201C;So all you want is for me to listen to you, right? Okay. If you can get this back, I&#x2019;ll listen to you for&#x2026; let&#x2019;s see, about an hour. I will sit quietly and consider everything you have to say seriously.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, really. I give you my word.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then&#x2026;&#x201D; Yifang comes at you with renewed resolve. Her technique is keen and swift &#x2013; her first stab would have hit you right in the chest if she was not aiming for the more difficult target; your hand holding her skull cap. You manage to draw back in time, but she presses the attack without pause. Even with your knowledge of how the Qingcheng Stab works, you find yourself quickly being pushed towards the edge of the ring. Her control over the technique is absolutely flawless; you find yourself thinking that the counter you had devised would probably work only four times out of ten, against an opponent of her caliber. If this had been a serious fight, where she was aiming to defeat you instead of getting the skull cap back, you would have certainly lost by now in your current condition.<br>
<br>
As it is, you can predict where she will strike thanks to the treasure you have in your hand. Still, you won&#x2019;t be able to hold out much longer. You slow down your movements, clutching your injured arm. A look of concern passes across her face, but it doesn&#x2019;t stop her from closing the distance as she attempts to wrest the skull cap away from you now that you are in a vulnerable position. Clever girl.<br>
<br>
In desperation, you toss the skull cap away, out of her reach. She leaps after it.<br>
<br>
Yifang catches the skull cap and turns around to look triumphantly at you, but at the same time the gong is sounded, signalling that she is out of bounds. Her face freezes as she realizes a bit too late what you were planning. Silly girl. You bow towards her respectfully. &#x201C;I will listen to all you have to say later, as promised.&#x201D; Thankfully, Yifang isn&#x2019;t as cunning as Qilin. That would never have worked if she was.<br>
<br>
The crowd is in a good mood despite the anti-climatic end to the match, apparently humoured sufficiently by your antics.<br>
<br>
As you are announced the winner, a young man comes running towards the stage. The tournament officials attempt to restrain him, holding him back. He seems to be wearing the uniform of a Huashan disciple.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You!&#x201D; he shouts, his voice ringing loud and clear, &#x201C;You are Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple, aren&#x2019;t you? Man Tiger Pig!&#x201D; There is an audible gasp from the crowd as they begin to murmur at this accusation. Yifang begins to come towards you, clearly worried, but you wave her off with a quick and subtle gesture of your fingers.<br>
<br>
You take one step forward and stare silently at the Huashan disciple from behind your mask. You have not met him before, of that you are sure. He falters slightly under your wordless gaze before bravely continuing his allegations. &#x201C;Your master killed my father! How dare you come all the way here in front of the honourable and noble Eight Sects when you study under such a cruel and murderous man?&#x201D; The tournament officials continue to push him back as they do their jobs. The man is clearly disrupting the event.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait!&#x201D; calls out a man from the benches where the tournament committee sits. As he stands up, you recognize the clothes to be that of Kunlun. He appears to be in his early thirties, with a rather distinguished moustache above his lips. &#x201C;Officials, free this brother of ours and allow him to speak. If indeed Man Tiger Pig is Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple, he must at least face up to the sins of his master. That is his duty as an apprentice. We can afford to bend the rules for such a serious matter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The tournament officials reluctantly let go of the Huashan disciple. With a single bound he leaps onto the stage.<br>
<br>
He shouts out his challenge, &#x201C;My name is Yu Gan! Your master, the Southern Maniac Zhang Jue, killed my father Yu Bing. He was struck down without righteous cause and died a horrible death. I have trained all my life to avenge his death. Now that I know his disciple is here, I would seek a match to uphold my father&#x2019;s honor! Will you respond, Man Tiger Pig?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
When he finishes, he places one hand on the hilt of his sword. You find funny that he is using the name &#x2018;Man Tiger Pig&#x2019; so seriously in connection with the tragic death of his father at Master Zhang&apos;s hands. The crowd is waiting with bated breath, eager to see how you will react.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You admit to being Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple. You don&#x2019;t think there is any need to hide it now, after your conversation with the leaders of Wudang and Shaolin.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You deny being Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple. You don&apos;t think Yu Gan&apos;s appearance is a coincidence. Someone is trying to lure you out, and you are not going to oblige.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You will fight him. Whether or not you admit to being Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple, if he has come up on stage you can&#x2019;t let him leave without the fight he wants. That would be rather impolite. Besides, it would serve as an easy reminder of your strength after your anti-climatic win over Yifang.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You don&#x2019;t fight him. You aren&apos;t going to push yourself after managing to avoid a straight fight with Yifang. It may disappoint the crowd, but you can&#x2019;t please everyone. You&apos;ll just have to talk your way out of the challenge.

            <h3>二十二 · Before the Finals</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Before the Finals</span></b><br>
<br>
With a loud sigh, your shoulders slump and you step back from Yu Gan. You suppose that the gig is up. &#x201C;Yes. I am the disciple of Zhang Jue,&#x201D; you admit, loud enough for the audience to hear. A ripple spreads amongst the crowd at your acknowledgement.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very good. You admit it,&#x201D; smiles your accuser grimly. &#x201C;You have nowhere to run, Man Tiger Pig. Fight me here and now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You want to fight me here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course! Why else would I be here?&#x201D; shouts Yu Gan.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But I do not want to fight you here,&#x201D; you say simply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then you are a coward after all,&#x201D; he snarls. &#x201C;Is that what the disciple of Zhang Jue is? Everyone, take a look at this gutless wimp!&#x201D; Yu Gan stretches out a finger, pointing it right in your face as he laughs loudly to the crowd.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You misunderstand me, Yu Gan. I do not wish to fight you here because it would be dishonourable of me to do so,&#x201D; you reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Dishonourable &#x2013; what are you talking about? Stop trying to find excuses and face me like a man! <i>Not </i>fighting me is dishonourable.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But you see, sir,&#x201D; you say with a hidden grin, &#x201C;You are angry and excited at finally being able to take vengeance for your father&#x2019;s murder upon the disciple of the man who you say killed him. I can understand that feeling. I, too, would be just as emotional. However, I am <i>sure </i>your respected master taught you not to rush into a fight hotheadedly. It would not be fair to you if I fight you now, when you are not in your best condition.&#x201D; You linger on that last sentence for a while, making sure that the crowd catches it, before continuing. &#x201C;After all, is it not said that the wise man&#x2019;s heart is as stable as the root of the world? Battle me when you are calmer, so that you may exhibit your full prowess in pursuit of justice.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-I <i>am </i>calm,&#x201D; he says quickly, slightly taken off guard at your sudden speech. &#x201C;You will not trick me with your flowery words!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure?&#x201D; you ask concernedly. &#x201C;I would not want to take advantage of you, sir. In fact, if I am truly Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple you must know my techniques are dangerous. Why risk your life impulsively? I am perfectly willing to take your challenge when you are feeling better.&#x201D; The audience seems to agree somewhat with your sentiment. At least, they are not jeering you and chanting for you to fight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is no need to wait. I am thinking perfectly clearly right now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you really, <i>really </i>sure?&#x201D; you ask again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I said I was calm!&#x201D; he shouts, drawing his sword. It looks like he is ready to attack. &#x201C;Whether you like it or not, Man Tiger Pig, justice will be served today. If I cannot reach your master,  I will settle for teaching you a lesson!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;...Is that so?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The man takes a step back. You stand there, head half-cocked to one side in the silly pig&#x2019;s mask, your posture loose and relaxed. Your sudden calmness is unnerving him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-yeah.&#x201D; He grips his sword with both hands. &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t let you escape this duel.&#x201D; It looks like he will attack you even if you refuse to fight, regardless of the damage to his reputation that it will do. There is a slight tremor in his stance, however. It looks like his instincts are up to the task of warning him. A cornered tiger is dangerous, even if wounded.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; A familiar voice rings out across the stage. Its owner glides down to the stage gracefully like a white swan whose neck you&#x2019;d gladly like to wring. Bai Jiutian. The crowd gives a murmur of approval. &#x201C;Brother Gan, as much as I hate to admit it, Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple has a point. You are being too rash right now. Do not throw your life away against this scoundrel.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Brother Jiutian, I cannot give up this opportunity to redeem my family&#x2019;s good name! I will need to avenge our humiliation at Zhang Jue&#x2019;s hands,&#x201D; cries Yu Gan, clearly upset. Your words seems to have had the opposite effect of what you intended, inciting him instead of calming him down. &#x201C;Even if it costs me my life to do so!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He attempts to lunge at you, but Bai Jiutian holds him back easily with one arm. &#x201C;No, brother! This will be unseemly. Besides, what good is it if you lose your life defending your father&#x2019;s name? Your father would have wanted you to live a good life and continue the family line. That is your <i>most </i>important duty!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not worry, Brother Gan. You are part of Huashan. When you entered the sect you became as family to us. I look up to you as if you were my own older brother. There is no need for you to fight Man Tiger Pig. He is Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple, not Zhang Jue himself. This fight is beneath your level. Leave it to me. <i>I </i>will take on Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple in your stead.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The crowd roars in surprise at Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s announcement, excited at the prospect of seeing him battle you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not today, however,&#x201D; he says loudly. &#x201C;As we can all see, Man Tiger Pig is injured from his previous battles. We will have our fight here, at this very place, the day after the finals. As a member of the tournament committee, I have the authority to do so. Whether you win or lose tomorrow, Man Tiger Pig, you will need to be made to acknowledge your master&#x2019;s misdeeds. We will not be fighting to kill. There is no need for more bloodshed&#x2026; but I would have you kneel and apologize to everyone you tricked in this tournament, prostrate and apologize for the crimes of your master, and unmask yourself to demonstrate your respect for the pugilistic community, to swear you will not demonstrate such disregard for our feelings ever again. In return, you have my word that until the conclusion of our duel, no one else in the orthodox community will challenge you for their numerous grievances against your master and disrupt your tournament preparations. What say you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You whistle. &#x201C;That is a very long list of demands.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are free to make your own demands should you win,&#x201D; shrugs Bai Jiutian elegantly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Unfortunately I cannot think of anything on such short notice. After all, I already had the fortune of witnessing the splendour of one of the Twin Flowers of Huashan yesterday. Anything I can ask now would pale in comparison to that,&#x201D; you say. The crowd laughs despite themselves. Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s face darkens, his smile turning upside down. &#x201C;Still with that flippant manner, I see. Very well. Name your demands before the fight then. I would not have you crying afterwards claiming that I did not give you sufficient motivation besides defending your own honour,&#x201D; he says coldly.<br>
<br>
You turn to leave, but he calls out for you to stop again. Sighing, you turn around. &#x201C;What now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai tosses a small pouch at you. &#x201C;Medicine for your wounds. These herbs are extremely effective. I would have you in your best condition before our duel, so that there can be no complaints.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Such a perfect gentleman. You nod in thanks.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, okay. I am sure you are more than satisfied to have taken the limelight away from the finals tomorrow, so could I leave now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I did not-&#x201C; begins Bai Jiutian indignantly, but you leave before he completes his sentence.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Later that evening, it is just you, Qilin, Cao&#x2019;er and Murong Yandi. Guo Fu and Pu&#x2019;er had been carried off by Wudang disciples led by Wu Jin, who had lost handily to the big lad but was impressed to the point of wanting to recruit him as a fellow brother. The Grand Taoist had mysteriously vanished before Wu Jin could obtain permission from him, but in the end he had managed to get confirmation from a senior Wudang disciple on the committee. Guo Fu promised that he would drop by later, however. Yifang had been summoned by the Abbess &#x2013; according to Cao&#x2019;er, she was to spend the night meditating in order to strengthen her mental discipline.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;these are expensive herbs, Jing,&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;&#x2026;golden fox leaves. They can heal physical wounds extremely quickly. You should be fully recovered by the time you fight with the white one if you use it. If not, by my skills alone I will only be able to restore some mobility to your arm in time for tomorrow&#x2019;s match... it will not be fully healed for another week.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t detect any traces of any poisons either,&#x201D; says Qilin as she lies belly-down on your bed, feeding one of those extremely expensive leaves to her toad. &#x201C;Of course, he might be using something I have no experience with, but I doubt such a poison exists. I never ingest anything of dubious source, though, so on the off chance I missed something - as unlikely as it may be - I do recommend you don&#x2019;t use his medicine. I don&#x2019;t trust that stuck-up prig.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I, for one, am still surprised that you are Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple,&#x201D; says Murong Yandi. &#x201C;It gave me the shock of my life.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201D; you chuckle. &#x201C;Did you cross paths with my master? I hope he didn&#x2019;t kill any of your family.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, no, of course not, but he has his&#x2026; reputation. My master fought yours before. According to him, Zhang Jue was one of the few pugilists who could make him draw his sword in battle.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not surprising. By the way, I have not met your master before. Do you think you could introduce us?&#x201D; Yandi shakes his head sadly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid not. My master is a bit of a recluse. He doesn&#x2019;t like talking with people, which is why he wants me to turn out differently.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Tomorrow will be the finals. You will be facing Nameless, the Persian fighter. Then, the day after, Bai Jiutian has scheduled a duel with you. He seems rather confident of winning. You <i>could </i>skip his challenge, of course.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You spend time studying ways to defeat Nameless, based of Qilin&#x2019;s first hand experience and Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s observations. You should focus on what is immediately ahead of you for now.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You spend time getting a headstart on preparing for the match against Bai Jiutian by consulting Murong Yandi. Since he came here to face the man, he should know something of his techniques.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You don&#x2019;t care about the fights at all. You hit the streets, attempting to lure out the people-in-black now that you have revealed your identity as Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You use the medicine that Bai Jiutian gave you.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do not use the medicine that Bai Jiutian gave you.

            <h3>二十三 · Tournament Finals: Nameless</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tournament Finals: Nameless</span></b><br>
<br>
In front of you stands your opponent, the masked fighter known as Nameless. The audience is excited and louder than ever. Two mysterious masked contestants &#x2013; one of which has admitted to be Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple and has received a challenge from the previous champion, while the other has exhibited a style of martial arts no one has ever seen in near flawless victories all through the tournament &#x2013; it is no surprise that the final match would draw a larger crowd than usual.<br>
<br>
After the both of you bow to each other, you spot the Abbot of Shaolin observing the match from his seat. You should <i>probably </i>try to win this one. Right before the match, Master Qi had made his customary appearance and happily informed you that both he and Abbot Fangzhang had decided to pool their money and bet on you for the grand finale. Something about showing those foreign devils what for, he&#x2019;d said.<br>
<br>
As the fight begins, you try to recall everything you know about your opponent.<br>
<br>
The fighter is a she, under that disguise. She is likely affiliated with the other two masked fighters in the tournament, Faceless and Shapeless. Qilin has told you that her moves hail from a form of martial arts practised by a Zoroastrian fire cult &#x2013; it is likely they all belong to the same organization. She is highly skilled, almost as good as Yifang. Both Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er think Nameless is at least as fast as you are, though not nearly as strong.<br>
<br>
She makes the first move, darting in to deliver a blow to your solar plexus. You parry her attack and throw your foot upwards in a kick that she dodges gracefully. Nameless steps back, her expression inscrutable behind that tiger mask. With a slight, mocking shrug, as if that exchange disappointed her, she dives back in again with a flurry of punches and kicks. You retaliate with the same, the both of you moving around the stage in a flowing dance of attack and counter-attack. She matches your speed with ease, finding more than enough time to give a reply for whatever you can throw at her. Your superior strength will be of no use if you cannot find a way to pin her down.<br>
<br>
As the exchange of moves continues, you realize that she is steadily increasing her focus on your left side, where your defense is poorer thanks to your injured arm. A quick feint to your left causes you to overextend yourself, compensating too much for your injury. Nameless is quick to capitalize on the chance that she has created. Two solid blows land in the middle of your chest, forcing you back.<br>
<br>
Instead of pursuing you, your masked opponent puts her hands on her hips and shakes her head wordlessly. The crowd cheers at this reversal; Man Tiger Pig is getting a taste of his own medicine and they are enjoying the show.<br>
<br>
You scratch your head and nod vigorously in response, acknowledging that you have to do better. Taking a stance, this time you go on the attack. Cao&#x2019;er had told you about a little quirk that Nameless seems to exhibit. She will always favour evading to her right, attempting to keep to her opponent&#x2019;s left. Taking careful, measured strikes, you wait for your chance.<br>
<br>
Even as Nameless takes a quick step to her right, narrowly dodging your straight kick, you have already predicted her course and begun your follow-up. A single elbow strike is all you can manage with your left arm, but it is enough to force her to block. Your attack crashes against her forearms, causing her to give out a single yelp of pain. Being the scoundrel that you are, you ignore a damsel&#x2019;s cry of distress and act to compound said distress by lashing out with the back of your fist. Your blow breaks her guard, forcing Nameless to back off in a hurry.<br>
<br>
This time, it is your turn to play to the audience. You wag a finger at her, sending the crowd wild.<br>
<br>
Nameless raises her hands and claps it thrice slowly and sarcastically in response. Then, she rushes in to continue the fight.<br>
<br>
After a series of blows, again you lure her into dodging right. As you launch your counter, you realize that you have been tricked. She is ready for you this time. Her leg snaps up swiftly in a powerful crescent kick. Cursing your carelessness, you redirect your efforts into defense just in time to grab her foot, stopping it from landing right in your flank.<br>
<br>
You pull at the foot, trying to drag her towards you, but with a quick wiggle she frees her foot from the boot and hops away, leaving you with a piece of empty footwear in your hand. Before you can drop it, however, her other boot comes sailing towards you, smacking you right in the pig&#x2019;s snout.<br>
<br>
The crowd seems to <i>really </i>like that one, judging by their guffaws.<br>
<br>
Nameless skips from bare foot to bare foot before settling into a stance and beckoning at you, daring you to make the next move.<br>
<br>
You oblige.<br>
<br>
The dance continues, as both of you circle around the stage without managing to get a firm upper hand on the other. Nameless is quick enough to evade your blows and skilled enough to prevent you from drawing your sword. On the other hand, her attacks aren&#x2019;t powerful enough that you are unable to block them, unlike Guo Fu&#x2019;s hammer-like punches. She is using her <i>neigong </i>to augment her strikes &#x2013; with every hit you can feel a mild burning sensation where her fists and kicks land, but your own <i>qi </i>swallows up the effect quickly enough for it not to matter.<br>
<br>
More worryingly, she seems to be getting faster and faster with every exchange, as if she is testing her own speed against yours. You are not sure if you will be able to keep up at this rate; Nameless could very likely end up being quicker than you are. It looks like she has been holding back throughout the competition... You have no choice.<br>
<br>
Taking a deep breath, you exert your <i>qinggong</i>. Your steps become lighter and faster; your sudden burst of speed catches your masked opponent off guard as you manage to get behind her.<br>
<br>
At this range and angle, even a lightly executed Chuzhan Fist should be enough to hit her. You drive a straight punch right towards her back.<br>
<br>
She turns, surprised.<br>
<br>
Then, she &#x2013; somehow &#x2013; somersaults backwards from her disadvantageous position before your fist hits home. As she lands, she immediately runs at you, faster than she has ever moved before.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;ll be a feint. If you throw an attack at her right now, she will evade it and counter &#x2013; she is ready for it. You settle backwards into a defensive stance.<br>
<br>
It does you no good.<br>
<br>
Nameless&#x2019;s visage blurs as she darts to the side right before she gets into range, faster than your eyes can follow. This is a speed you cannot match. You try to turn your head to track her, something about her technique seeming extremely familiar to you.<br>
<br>
That&#x2019;s right.<br>
<br>
There&apos;s no mistaking it.<br>
<br>
Yinglang Step.<br>
<br>
You know enough of the technique to prepare a counter attack, but the masked fighter has already flanked you with incredible speed, her palm hitting just under your ribcage. She unleashes her <i>qi </i>with that strike. The burning is intense. It is as if the churning, murky sea of oil that is your own <i>qi</i> was just lit up by a match. A searing conflagration scorches your body from within for just a brief second before your internal energy swallows it up, smothering it in darkness.<br>
<br>
It looks like Nameless was expecting you to fall with that attack&#x2026; her follow-up comes a split second too slow, as does your counter, from the unexpected strength of her <i>neigong</i>. The both of you evade the mutual attacks by a hair&#x2019;s breadth.<br>
<br>
Her uppercut catches the chin of the pig, tearing it off.<br>
<br>
Your Shouwang Claws hooks the cheek of the tiger, ripping it off.<br>
<br>
The paper-and-cloth masks flutter to the ground of the stage as the crowd holds their breath.<br>
<br>
Your first thought is that you <i>should </i>have thought of that. A mask underneath a mask. Nameless is wearing an ornate, white porcelain mask that covers the top of her face, her straight black hair having come untied thanks to the force of your attack. Stylized fire is painted across the surface of the mask. Even with her face covered, however, you can tell that she is likely a peerless beauty.<br>
<br>
A beauty that is decidedly not Persian, whose people you have seen before during your time in the court. Instead&#x2026;<br>
<br>
The corners of her lips twist upwards in a taunting smile full of mockery as she hops backwards, putting some more distance between the both of you. The match is still on, even if the both of you are now unmasked. Well, you more so than she is&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You have no hope of matching her speed &#x2013; and having a chance of winning &#x2013; without going all out and using Yuanshi Hundun in combination with the Kuanglang Step. If that is what you need to do to achieve victory, so be it.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You hold back on using your <i>neigong</i>; Nameless is not Guo Fu, and you could just as easily kill her or injure her too severely if you lose control at an inopportune moment. You will try to win without it.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>If she is who you think she is&#x2026; you attempt to engage Nameless in conversation. Perhaps it will distract her. Or perhaps it will distract you. Still, you need to know for sure.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You would rather focus on the fight instead. You can always talk to her afterwards, right?

            <h3>二十四 · Amesha Spenta</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Amesha Spenta</span></b><br>
<br>
Still too fast.<br>
<br>
She is still too fast for you to handle, even with your inner strength in play. The faster and wilder your attacks are, the more elusive she becomes, slipping away from your grasp and retaliating with a series of burning strikes.<br>
<br>
Her heel lands square on your temple, jarring your head. The girl packs quite a powerful punch in that lithe frame, but you have no time to be amazed by her strength. You turn your fall into a tumble, rolling away from her to regain some distance. You take a defensive stance, keeping your guard up. Your head is still spinning from her kick. Your knees are beginning to feel weak. You don&#x2019;t think you can take another hit from her and still stay on your feet. She paces around you like a hunter stalking her prey. Her smile still remains, her attitude confident. Still, you did not come here to lose. This is not a fight you can win by attempting to outdo her in the swiftness of your movements.  You remember one of Master Zhang&#x2019;s suggestions  &#x2013; he had plenty of those to give, though in context if you did not heed his suggestions you had a good chance of ending up heavily injured or dead.<br>
<br>
You wait, keeping yourself perfectly still. Your calm exterior strikes a contrast with the muddled mess of <i>qi</i> that surges within you; it is a difficult posture to hold. Your very nature yearns to leap back into the fight and strike out at random, but you suppress that itching urge and hold your stance.<br>
<br>
No wasted movements, said your master. Allow your <i>qi </i>to guide your movements, but do not give yourself over to it. Nudge it along your desired path&#x2026; then throw all your power behind that strike.<br>
<br>
Honestly&#x2026; easier said than done.<br>
<br>
It is a skill you have yet to master, but you attempt it anyway. You focus, watching Nameless make another run at you.<br>
<br>
Will she feint to the left? Attack from the right? Or will she attempt a direct assault?<br>
<br>
She&#x2019;s too fast for your eyes to track &#x2013; as she closes in you give up on attempting to predict her. Enough thinking. You spring into action, following your instinct. A frontal attack. That has to be it. Her arm whips around in a blur; her fingers clip your ear, drawing blood. Your sudden, forward movement has thrown off her timing. She will try to pull back and escape, but at this distance&#x2026; Channeling Yuanshi Hundun, your internal energy surges up through your arms, lashing out at your opponent.<br>
<br>
A nudge, to focus it where you want it to go. Then, you summon all your might.<br>
<br>
The effect is not unlike that of forcing a wide river to flow through a narrow channel.<br>
<br>
Your <i>qi</i> does not react well to being constrained and controlled this way, responding with an explosion of power that tears through your own body painfully. Your palm strikes her right in the center of her chest. You exert enough control to pull back at the last second, but the resulting force is still enough to propel Nameless across the stage and out of the ring.<br>
<br>
Wincing as your muscles and tendons start the long and arduous process to self-recovery, you vow never to take up one of Master Zhang&#x2019;s suggestions again unless it is absolutely a matter of life or death.<br>
<br>
To your relief, while the crowd cheers your victory you see that Nameless has pushed herself up into a sitting position, though a trickle of blood runs down from her lips. She has definitely been injured by your strike. Strangely, you do not feel as happy about winning the tournament as you thought you would. You begin to walk over to the masked girl. If she is who you think she is&#x2026; You begin to call out, &#x201C;Yu-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
Your words die in your throat. Your feet stop.<br>
<br>
A crippling fear washes over you. There is a strong killing intent aimed at you. Your instincts scream as you whirl to receive an attack coming from your side. Palm meets palm &#x2013; your assailant is an older man, with most of his features hidden under a peasant&#x2019;s conical straw hat. His cloak billows about him, revealing an ornate garment underneath not of Han origin.<br>
<br>
In a split second, a raging conflagration invades your body.<br>
<br>
Despite the nature of your <i>qi</i>, it is insufficient to fight back internal energy of this magnitude. You are blasted away from the man, in the same way as what you did to Nameless just a while ago. Though you land on your feet, the strength of his attack forces you to drop to your knees soon after.<br>
<br>
This man is strong. He might even be the equal of Master Zhang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not touch the Holy Maiden,&#x201D; growls the mysterious man in a low voice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t know if she&#x2019;s holy if you don&#x2019;t even let me talk to her,&#x201D; you respond. &#x201C;Besides, I was touching her all through the fight-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
You regret your flippant words quickly enough as the man charges at you. Before he reaches you, however, a bright yellow-and-red cassock obscures your view. Fangzhang, the Abbot of Shaolin, stands between you and the intruder, looking every bit as impassable as a mountain despite his old frame. Your assailant does not pull back even so.  He attacks Fangzhang head-on, striking out with his fist.<br>
<br>
The Abbot meets his opponent&#x2019;s fist with his head, pitting his bare wrinkled dome against hardened knuckles. There is a clear ringing sound, like the tolling of a great bell, as the mysterious intruder is thrown back. He gazes at the Abbot impassively, shaking his hand.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The famed Northern Monk of Shaolin. This will be exciting,&#x201D; he grins.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop.&#x201D; The order comes not from Fangzhang, but from Nameless. Surprisingly, the man acquiesces quickly, bending his knee. Two more behatted persons have emerged on the stage, the tournament officials and committee helpless to stop them. They offer a helping hand to Nameless, but she shrugs it off haughtily and stands straight up, staring at me. Then, she turns to one of her acquaintances and whispers something. The man nods. He removes his hat, and the rest follow suit. They don&#x2019;t appear to be Persian, but neither are they Han; their looks are exotic and you cannot place their ethnicity. Turning to the Abbot and the audience, he introduces himself in perfect Han.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am called Vahista, Amesha of the great Fire Temple of Gushnasp. I have come to the Central Plains of the Tang as servant of my lord of the flame, to witness our Holy Maiden challenge your youths in battle. We have found you lacking.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She lost,&#x201D; I point out loudly, to the laughs of the crowd. Behind him, the Holy Maiden&#x2019;s eyes flash in irritation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not to one of the Eight Sects&#x2019;, who dominate the pugilistic world,&#x201D; responds Vahista calmly. &#x201C;Indeed, our Holy Maiden bested any of the Eight Sects&#x2019; disciples that stood in her way with ease. This shows us that your teachings are weak, and ours are strong. After all, students are only as good as their teachers.&#x201D; He looks at the Abbot as he says that last word; it is clearly a taunt.<br>
<br>
Fangzhang, however, remains unfazed and silent. You might have to revise your opinion of the old man now.<br>
<br>
After getting no response from the Abbot, Vahista continues to address his audience. &quot;We do not believe the Eight Sects are capable of protecting the people. If this is what their younger generation is capable of, there is no future for this country in ten years&apos; time. The Eight Sects take and give little in return. They only maintain the status quo, never seeking improvement. How many villages have fallen because the inhabitants were unable to protect themselves in the absence of orthodox pugilists to defend them? On my way here I have seen dozens of small communities plundered by bandits in their moment of weakness. None of you can be everywhere at once despite all your good intentions. We aim to change the world for the better, that such tragedies will not happen again. The Fire of Gushnasp will show that it is a better protector for the people than the Eight Sects. We declare a challenge. Heed our words. Six months from now, the strongest fighters of Gushnasp, including our temple&apos;s lord, will be present at Heihu Valley. There, we will demonstrate our superiority over the pugilists of the Central Plains once and for all. We will do this after the manner of the Central Plains. I believe it is customary to arrange for a duel between disciples and masters of differing sects. That is how it will be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
You curse inwardly. You had come with the intention of issuing a public challenge to the Eight Sects should you win, but doing that <i>now</i>, after the fire cult has issued <i>theirs</i>... that&apos;s only going to look silly. You are forced to abandon the notion now.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the crowd is silent, not knowing how to respond to this sudden turn of events. Even the eloquent Bai Jiutian seems surprised by the challenge of the cultists. The eyes of everyone present, commoner and pugilist alike, turn to Abbot Fangzhang. As the most senior and respected pugilist present, he is their de facto leader. His response will be representative for them all.<br>
<br>
After what seems like a long time, he grins, and gives a single, wordless nod. Vahista returns a slight bow, seemingly satisfied. Then, he focuses his attention on you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Young man, you are not a member of the Eight Sects&apos;, are you?&quot; he calls out to you as you recuperate behind Fangzhang.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do I look like one?&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiles thinly. &quot;No, you do not. I am sorry for asking such a silly question. You have a great power, and are unbound to any of the orthodox sects; if you are interested in finding out how you can use it to serve a better cause, we would gladly educate you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I&apos;ve never been one to sit still and take in lessons,&quot; you reply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pity,&quot; sighs Vahista. &quot;We will be leaving the city now, but should you change your mind later today you may catch up to us at Wufushan. We will be there for a brief while before continuing to head west. Do consider our invitation.&quot; With that, the cultists leave, two of them supporting the injured Holy Maiden as they bound up a nearby building with their qinggong and vanish.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm, I thought you would be brooding on the rooftop,&#x201D; says Qilin, peeking into your room.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why would I be doing that?&#x201D; you mutter, rolling your eyes. With the treatment Cao&#x2019;er gave you right after the tournament, your wounds inflicted from the last fight should recover rather quickly, but there are still some niggling pains left in your limbs. Of course, your left arm remains rather stubborn &#x2013; exerting yourself today has not helped its recovery.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, you just look the sort to sit dramatically on the roof, watching the people mill about their business below as you loom over them brooding about all the bad things that happen to you all the time,&#x201D; says Qilin airily as she lets herself in without asking your permission.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s- do I really give off that sort of impression?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You do,&#x201D; she replies solemnly. Then, giving you a grin that you don&#x2019;t like the look of, she continues, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the story between you and the fire cult&#x2019;s Holy Maiden, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-what&#x2019;s what?&#x201D; you sputter. &#x201C;What are you talking about?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, an adult woman can smell out this sort of thing. I could tell, by the way you were acting. You know her, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe,&#x201D; you mumble, &#x201C;maybe not. It&#x2019;s not any of your business.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She giggles, leaning closer to you until you can smell her subtle fragrance. &#x201C;Is it <i>that </i>sort of relationship, then? Star-crossed lovers?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nothing like that. There is <i>nothing </i>going on there, so you can stop your wild fancies now, Miss Chi,&#x201D; you say quickly, perhaps a bit more harshly than you intended. It has been a rather long day.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; She draws back, strangely surprised at your denial, yet with a weird smile on her face. You wonder if she&#x2019;s planning something. &#x201C;I suppose that is good too&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure you didn&#x2019;t come here just to ask about the Holy Maiden.&#x201D; You finish packing your things &#x2013; you will be leaving by tomorrow at the latest. Qilin shrugs. &#x201C;I thought I would come and offer Xiaoqing to keep you company &#x2013;&#x201C; &#x2013;her snake pokes its head out of her collar and hisses &#x2013; &#x201C;&#x2013;if you were feeling down or something. You seem fine, so I&#x2019;ll save Xiaoqing the trouble. What do you plan to do tomorrow, though? You have a fight with Bai Jiutian, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You do. It had slipped your mind, with what had happened during and after the final match. You had won the tournament, earning the crowd&#x2019;s applause. Your reputation had risen with some sects, but Vahista&#x2019;s parting words to you have sowed the seeds of suspicion in others. You had plenty of taels now, a gleeful monk and beggar having finally given you your fair share of the winnings. You even laid your hands on a Shaolin technique manual, though when you browsed through the Yingzhao Fist (&#x9DF9;&#x722A;&#x62F3;, Eagle Claw Fist) manual it ended up being surprisingly similar to the Shouwang Claws you already knew. As a basic technique there was not much you could learn from it, but you should be able to incorporate the Yingzhao moves into a third style of the Shouwang Claws.<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi had been dragged out of the city by his teacher right after the tournament &#x2013; you did not have the chance to say goodbye to him. The Abbot and Qi Liuwu had left too, now focused on preparing for the duel with the Fire Cult. Guo Fu would be returning with the Wudang disciples tomorrow, as will Cao&#x2019;er and Yifang with the Abbess and Emei. You are not sure where Qilin is going, but you doubt she will remain here.<br>
<br>
There is nothing left for you to do in Luoyang, now that the tournament is over. All that remains is to address Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s challenge.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will turn up tomorrow to accept Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s challenge. You aren&#x2019;t one to back down from a fight, and you doubt that you can&#x2019;t take him on.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You turn up tomorrow to reject his challenge publicly. There are words you would have with him now that you do not need to bother hiding your identity.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You do not return the golden fox leaves. They are valuable and you might have a use for them. Who cares what he says?<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You return the golden fox leaves. He will not be able to say that you stole his medication and dodged his challenge.<br>
<br>
<b>3. </b>You return the golden fox leaves. Qilin, however, has suggested a little something extra with it &#x2013; an itching powder she cooked up. Nothing lethal, but extremely irritating&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You do not turn up, opting to leave the city quietly.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>If you are to catch up with the fire cultists, you must leave tonight to get to Wufushan in time. You head there &#x2013; you are interested in what they have to say.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>West is not where you want to go. Your paths will cross again. In the meantime, you have business at Yuhua Hall that has been neglected far too long.

            <h3>二十五 · Leaving Luoyang</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leaving Luoyang</span></b><br>
<br>
There is a rather sizeable throng awaiting your match with Bai Jiutian. At the centre of the stage you see the man himself waiting patiently, the perfect picture of a refined gentleman. The duel had been scheduled a few hours past daybreak, but the sun was now approaching its zenith. Even the calm and composed Bai Jiutian is already sweating from standing in the heat.<br>
<br>
A twitch of irritation passes across his face. You decide to reveal yourself &#x2013; the crowd is getting restless. Standing up from your shaded vantage point on a nearby roof, you call out to your opponent. The crowd begins to murmur as all eyes are drawn to you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are late, Man Tiger Pig. What are the limits of your irresponsible ways?&#x201D; Bai Jiutian replies loudly, shading his eyes as he looks up at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My apologies for this late arrival, Young Master Bai, but my wounds from facing down the Fire Cult have yet to heal. I spent most of the morning unable to walk.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did the medicine I give you not help?&#x201D; he asks suspiciously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;About that&#x2026;&#x201D; You throw the pouch at him. Bai Jiutian catches it, turning it around before his eyes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not sure why you thought wormtail leaves would help my recovery,&#x201D; you continue. &#x201C;Those are useful for fevers and the like, but hardly suitable for injuries of the limbs.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wormtail leaves?&#x201D; Bai Jiutian is surprised and angered. &#x201C;I gave you golden fox leaves as a mark of my goodwill!&#x201D; Opening the pouch, he rummages within and picks out a shining leaf to prove it to the crowd. &#x201C;There!&#x201D; He seems to be slightly relieved to see the leaves he gave you for some reason.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I am truly sorry for my ineptitude, Young Master Bai,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I am not a well-studied person. Still, you cannot blame me. Wormtail and golden fox have a similar colour when dried, and I was <i>not </i>expecting to see something as valuable as golden fox leaves. I did not think a Huashan disciple could have afforded to walk around with such expensive medication, let alone give it away to someone he considers a foe. My presumptuous nature has caused me to behave in an unsightly manner, it seems.&#x201D; You lower your head in an apologetic manner.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; No matter,&#x201D; grimaces Bai Jiutian. &#x201C;It was not something I bought. It was a precious gift from a precious friend, and I would gladly use it to preserve the honour of Huashan, even if it would have been wasted on a scoundrel like you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is good thing that it was not wasted then,&#x201D; you shrug.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you going to come down and fight me, Man Tiger Pig? For that matter, why are you still appearing with that mask?&#x201D; he challenges, going straight to the point.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This?&#x201D; You tap the side of the mask &#x2013; tiger-striped pig&#x2019;s masks have become rather popular with the roadside stalls since yesterday. It was no trouble getting one. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s become a habit. The mask makes me feel safe.&#x201D; In truth, you only did it because you know it will irritate him further to look at that mask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It makes you look like a coward,&#x201D; taunts Bai. &#x201C;<i>Will </i>you come down and exchange moves with me now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would, but I won&#x2019;t.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Truly a coward,&#x201D; sneers the man. The crowd begins to jeer at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You misunderstand me, Young Master Bai. I do not wish to fight you simply because I do not wish to injure you. Everyone knows that Zhang Jue&#x2019;s techniques are cruel and lethal. Should I harm you by accident&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You will not lay even a finger on me,&#x201D; he replies confidently. &#x201C;The swordplay of Huashan is beyond your ability to defeat.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yet I laid my hands on your junior&#x2019;s sash.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Only because you, Man Tiger Pig, are no gentleman.&#x201D; But he pauses for a while, uncertain &#x2013; if you had a trick up your sleeve, there was still the chance that you could hit him. He is not so blind as to deny that possibility.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I fear only the <i>rare </i>probability that a misjudged attack might wound you, Young Master Bai. I would not tempt fate. It takes only one stroke of misfortune to ruin a man&#x2019;s life forever. Indeed, if you were injured, who would lead the ranks of our generation in the battle against the Fire Cult?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The crowd murmurs their approval. It seems like they already do see him as their leader. Bai Jiutian himself seems slightly thoughtful as he considers your words. His gaze falls downward, probably calculating the risks and honour at stake.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Even though I may be the disciple of Zhang Jue, neither of us are aligned with these cultists&#x2019; interests. They are an intruder into our way of life,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Under their rule the pugilistic world would be forever changed. Is it so hard to believe that I would not like to see their victory any more than you do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian looks up. &#x201C;There is no evidence that you are telling the truth-&#x201C; He finds himself talking to empty air, as you have slipped off while he was lost in thought. You have no time to debate him right now &#x2013; you suspect that his intentions in this are not pure, and he would force you into a fight regardless of what you said should you stay there for too long.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You board a barge down the Grand Canal after bidding goodbye to Cao&#x2019;er, Yifang and Guo Fu by the riverbank. You reminded Cao&#x2019;er of your promise to pick her up at Emei, but it seems that you had no need to do so &#x2013; she has been counting down the days till your probable arrival. Yifang reminds <i>you </i>that you owe her some time, but she says that she will not make good on that claim right now, though she does not give a reason why. Guo Fu and his wife thanked you profusely for all you have done for them &#x2013; thanks that you receive with some embarrassment. Now that he is a Wudang disciple, his livelihood should be assured. You told him to convey your regards if he should meet the Grand Taoist Wang Zhengchong, and to look after his wife even while training hard in martial arts.<br>
<br>
Qilin was not here, but that wasn&#x2019;t surprising. When you woke up this morning you found a small letter addressed to you lying by your pillow. In it, she said that she was returning south to her &#x2018;family business&#x2019; in order to get a better grasp on recent events. She also left you a sachet of Five Poisons Special Powder as a sample of her work, which she claimed to be her own modification of a bread-and-butter Wudu Cult product after doing some testing here. She describes it as a type of poison that causes the victim to go into seizures without inflicting permanent harm.<br>
<br>
Of course, she also took some taels from your pouch while you were sleeping as compensation. Apparently it wasn&#x2019;t a <i>free </i>sample.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You stop by Xuzhou on your way to Yangzhou &#x2013; the barge will hold here for a day or two while they take on and unload cargo. Giving Scholar Jiang&#x2019;s residence a wide berth, you head towards Luoying Manor.<br>
<br>
As always, Lady Ji is there, a constant, unaging presence. She invites you in kindly and has her maids bring you to the inner courtyard before mysteriously disappearing off somewhere. At this time of the year the Manor does not get many visitors, but still there are a few strange scholars and wandering fighters present. You should be able to find out some things from them.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Formulate two questions to ask, with each question addressing a single subject of interest. You can ask anything you want, from politics to techniques, but there is no guarantee you will get an answer useful to you, or even an answer at all, depending on what question you ask. For example, general questions get you general answers that could be too vague to be useful, while specific questions might get you more details, but with a greater risk of getting no useful information if no one here knows anything about the specific thing you are asking.

            <h3>二十六 · Yuhua in Yangzhou</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Yuhua in Yangzhou</span></b><br>
<br>
Despite popular belief, some people insist that General Yang Xue betrayed his country not because of lust for power, or greed for wealth, but for the love of a woman. No matter his reason, however, his name will go down in history as the traitor that allowed the Tujue to invade. By the time the Imperial Court finally realized the treachery of their greatest general, the horses of Guruldai Khagan had already swept past the mountains of Xiliang and were riding on Chang&#x2019;an.<br>
<br>
The invasion of the Tujue was swift, effective and brutal. Unlike his predecessors, Guruldai of the Ashina had ambitions to establish a permanent seat of power and crown himself Emperor of a new dynasty. Instead of sacking and looting cities, he conquered them. Emperor Gaosheng retreated from Chang&#x2019;an, fleeing south as the Tujue continued their onslaught. Though the Tang had a million men at arms, they were also focused on threats to the northeast and the south. It took time to redirect their armies at the nomadic horsemen &#x2013; horsemen that should have been kept in check by Yang Xue&#x2019;s forces.<br>
<br>
The bulk of the resistance in the early years of the war fell to the populace. It was during this time that the sects&#x2019; prominence began to wax. The skilled martial artists served as both leaders and spies, traversing the battlefront and risking their lives to defend the victims of war. Soon they had banded together under the leadership of the Taoist Wang Zhengchong, a disciple of Wudang, forming an irregular force that operated mainly behind enemy lines. They distracted and slowed down the Khagan&#x2019;s advance enough for the main Tang armies to launch a successful counter-offensive, recapturing city after city.<br>
<br>
It was then that General Yang Xue returned to the forefront of the war, his whereabouts prior to this unknown since the early days of the invasion. Taking command of the Tujue tribes, he directed a series of smashing victories against the Tang forces, before almost breaking them for good at Moyue Pass. Thanks to Yang Xue&#x2019;s abilities, it seems that Guruldai Khagan&#x2019;s ambitions would come to fruition. The Tang still had one card up their sleeves, however.<br>
<br>
Finally heeding the Emperor Gaosheng&#x2019;s desperate request, Wang Zhengchong and the monk Fangzhang embarked upon a suicidal mission, penetrating deep into the heart of the enemy camp by themselves. They reappeared the next morning with the heads of the  enemy Khagan and the traitor Yang Xue, bloodied and battered by their ordeal.<br>
<br>
This was more than enough to demoralize the Tujue. Under pressure from the regrouping Tang armies, they scattered, fleeing the Central Plains.<br>
<br>
The five year war had severe and long-lasting effects on the country. In the aftermath, the freed northern regions had relied heavily on the relatively untouched south to rebuild. Emperor Gaosheng raised taxes drastically to fund the reconstruction, creating even greater unease amongst the populace. Still, the vast riches and well-established bureaucracy of the government meant that this would not deal a fatal blow to the dynasty. Meanwhile, his sons, the royal princes that had played a part during the war, began to squabble amongst themselves, each seeing opportunity in the dynasty&#x2019;s weakness to gain more influence over the Imperial Court.<br>
<br>
As the country began the uneasy process of recovery, tensions seethed underneath the surface.<br>
<br>
This boiled over a mere three years after the Tujue had been driven off, when Emperor Gaosheng died suddenly of a mysterious illness. His designated heir, Crown Prince Li Xiude, did not survive to take the throne as he passed from a dagger in his back mere hours after receiving news of his father&#x2019;s death. From Gaosheng&#x2019;s twenty six surviving sons, three major factions emerged.<br>
<br>
The Second Prince Li Wang led the largest faction, with eight brothers at his back. After the Crown Prince, he was said to be the most excellent of the princes, with both strength and smarts.<br>
<br>
The Eleventh Prince Li Suguang, had influence over six other brothers. He was an ambitious and powerful man who had made his name in the Tujue war.<br>
<br>
The Sixth Prince Li Zhou, led five of his brothers in vying for the throne. Though his group was the smallest, he was said to be a charismatic speaker and kind leader.<br>
<br>
The various generals, military prefects, and martial arts sects threw their support behind each of the factions thanks to the work the various princes had done behind the scenes. This resulted in open war.<br>
<br>
As the conflict progressed, the Imperial princes began dying from blades that they saw coming, those that they did not see coming, and those that they should have seen coming. Surprisingly, the Eleventh Prince was one of the first, dying in an ambush with two of his brothers.<br>
<br>
In the end, however, the winner was an unexpected contender. The Twenty-Seventh Prince, Li Ming. In the midst of the conflict, he had managed to secure support from his siblings in all three factions. The rival princes had their feet swept out from under them. Li Ming was ruthless and quick in his actions. Cornering his siblings within a month from the time he made his move, he finally ended the civil war by capturing and beheading fifteen princes, including the Second and the Sixth, when they approached him to negotiate peace.<br>
<br>
The next day, he crowned himself Emperor Taisheng.<br>
<br>
The continuous battles taking place across the country had exacted a serious toll on the treasury. As a response, the government of the new Emperor began enacting policies to decentralize the bureaucracy, giving the prefects leeway to do what they will as long as taxes to the Imperial Court were paid on time.<br>
<br>
This, coupled with the concentration of military power in the Imperial Court&#x2019;s hands and the summary execution of the entire families of prefects that did not heed Emperor Taisheng&#x2019;s instructions upon the pretext of corruption, had the effect of galvanizing the prefectures to ensure the taxes were submitted duly in order to avoid the capital&#x2019;s gaze from falling upon them.<br>
<br>
Of course, this only meant that corruption began to take place in other ways&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The sleep-inducing history lesson you received at Luoying Manor was half-forgotten by the time you made your way to Yangzhou. The scholars had droned on for hours with plenty of details, but you only managed to remember part of it. It was definitely not something you could memorize that easily &#x2013; you are not some sort of brilliant scholar that could absorb in an hour the knowledge that took them decades to collect. What they said was insightful in its own way, but in the end you learnt nothing that would help you with your goals.<br>
<br>
As for the misfortune of your birth, the only thing they could determine was that the Taisha star shone upon you. You would bring about the downfall of the order of Heaven, sharing your misfortune with the entire country, but the scholars did not know enough to go into specifics. They said that they could be easily wrong about their readings; they were scholars after all, and not astrologers.<br>
<br>
Lady Ji had appeared to you shortly before you left and recommended in her mysterious manner that you seek out the All-Seeing Astrologer, Hua Jin, if you desired to know your destiny. She does not know where he is now; according to her, it would be fate if you found him, and fate if you didn&#x2019;t.<br>
<br>
No matter.<br>
<br>
You put all thoughts of fate and destiny away from your mind. After days of travel, during which you studied the manual Master Yao gave you, you have reached your destination. You are in Yangzhou now, the most prosperous city in the entire empire. It may not be as populous as Chang&#x2019;an, but the bustling, thriving activity in Yangzhou cannot be matched even by Xuzhou. More than anywhere else, Yangzhou was the economic center of the Tang Dynasty, where the largest merchant houses were located&#x2026; and also where the most renowned brothel operated.<br>
<br>
You find yourself outside Yuhua Hall soon enough; it was not hard to find. Now that you are finally here, the only thing you need to do is to enter and begin searching for information.<br>
<br>
From the looks of it, however, it would be rather hard &#x2013; or rather, expensive &#x2013; to gain entry. An elegantly written flyer near the brothel stated that entrance alone would require a deposit of easily a quarter of your finances. You have no idea how much more you would be expected to spend within. It is a good thing that you had your share of earnings from betting at the tournament.<br>
<br>
No matter what, you would probably have to make yourself more respectable &#x2013; that meant spending on clothes to replace your tattered and dirty ones.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You enter Yuhua Hall as a client, spending your winnings in order to obtain information.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You attempt to enter Yuhua Hall as a servant, finding a way to sell yourself into servitude.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You attempt to enter Yuhua Hall as a merchant, peddling Yao&#x2019;s Protective Sheath.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You attempt to sneak into Yuhua Hall like a thief, attempting to obtain information without revealing yourself.

            <h3>二十七 · The Drunken Scholar</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Drunken Scholar</span></b><br>
<br>
After declaring your identity as a itinerant purveyor of certain protective objects, you had been ushered in through a side entrance by the staff of the brothel. They guided you through a series of winding paths through an ornate garden, leading you to a simple pavilion some distance away from the main building. An attractive lady is there, playing chess with a distinguished-looking gentleman. Upon your arrival, she whispers something to the man. He gets up, scowling at you, before leaving the pavilion.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This had better be worth my time, peddler,&#x201D; says the elegantly-dressed woman disinterestedly as she gestures for you to sit. From her looks, she cannot be older than her mid-twenties. Her face is lightly made-up, after the fashion currently popular in the capital. &quot;I assure you it is, my lady,&quot; you say cheerfully, taking your place. &quot;I must say, it is remarkable that someone so young is the proprietor of such a successful establishment!&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman laughs dismissively, not even glancing at you. &quot;That would be my mother, Madame Xia. Unfortunately, the madame is away for business, so it falls to me to deal with the operations of Yuhua Hall in her absence. Now, let&apos;s get down to business quickly and skip the introductions. My time is rather valuable.&quot; You nod to acknowledge her wish to avoid small talk. It looks like you will have to show your product before you can even begin to ask about what you are really here for.<br>
<br>
When you reveal Yao&apos;s Protective Sheath, the woman&apos;s eyes narrow slightly, her nose wrinkling just a bit. Otherwise, she remains impressively unruffled. &quot;The scent is an issue I am still working on,&quot; you say apologetically, &quot;but I can assure you that the ointment only serves a protective purpose to complement the sheath itself. The specially sewn covering, on its own, is still superior to any sheath in use today.&quot;<br>
<br>
With no hesitation, the woman plucks the dripping sheath out of the jar and rolls it between her fingers. She nods her head - it looks like she is a connoisseur when it came to these items, able to recognise true quality when she sees it. &quot;This is truly great workmanship. Sensitivity issues should be a thing of the past with this. I already have some ideas in mind to handle the smell, so that should be a minor problem for us. However, it does not seem like you can supply us with enough stock. You are just a wandering merchant, are you not? I do not have the habit of purchasing just one sheath. That would be pointless for Yuhua Hall. How much stock can you supply us?&quot;<br>
<br>
She is correct, you would not have the time to devote to full-time manufacture of these protective sheaths. You do not intend to actually make this your main livelihood. However, you did not spend a year dealing with greedy merchants without learning a thing or two about business.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually...&quot;<br>
<br>
You reveal your plan to her. In return for a small fee to be paid whenever your sheaths are used in the brothel - and they would be the only ones available - you would provide her the recipe. On her part, the new coverings would likely increase Yuhua Hall&apos;s reputation further as the pioneer and leader of this trade. She seems rather taken with the idea. The two of you negotiate for a while on the exact percentage of your cut, before finally deciding on a rather miniscule amount. It would still be enough to support you for the rest of your life, however, unless Yuhua Hall were to burn to the ground.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem rather experienced for your age,&#x201D; smiles the woman thinly and reluctantly, though she is clearly getting the better deal out of this. &#x201C;Very well. I believe we have come to terms. Xiaojin, go and get me Xiaoyu,&#x201D; she orders. The girl bows and runs off. While awaiting her return, the woman turns her attentions back to you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, what is the name of this peddler?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am Xu Jing,&#x201D; you reply, &#x201C;and how should I address you, my lady?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My family name is Xia, and my first name is Xue. You may call me Miss Xia. I would not dare to be called a lady in my line of business,&#x201D; says the woman, a glimmer of good humour in her eyes. You bow your head in acknowledgement. &#x201C;Miss Xia it is, then.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, our good scholar is here,&#x201D; calls out Miss Xia as she looks past you. &#x201C;I have a contract for you to draft, Xiaoyu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The smell of alcohol reaches you before the person does &#x2013; as you turn around, you see a man tottering up on unsteady legs. You do not know whether he is suffering from a hangover or still drunk. Perhaps it is both. As he draws closer, you recognize his face. His grooming seems to have gone to the dogs, his eyes are badly bloodshot, and there are worry lines across his brow, but it seems to be Xiahou Yu, the young scholar you met at Luoying Manor. Gone is that elegant, quiet, and slightly snobbish demeanour that he possessed more than a year ago. Now he looks the part of a drunkard even more than Qi Liuwu does&#x2026; and that is saying something.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Huh. A contract,&#x201D; he grumbles, his eyes kept to the floor. &#x201C;Another one of those, I suppose. At least it&#x2019;s a change from the stupid flyers you make me draw every day. I, who would have come tops in the Imperial examination, drawing flyers for a brothel. Oh, fate plays with man in the cruellest of ways. Ink? Where is my ink and brush? And paper. Come on, get to it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Miss Xia laughs as she bids the servants to gather what he needs. As they prepare the writing materials, she recites the terms of the contract. Xiahou Yu doesn&#x2019;t seem to be listening, grasping his head and lamenting his luck, but once she is done, he sighs, grabs the brush and begins writing almost immediately. Surprisingly, his brushstrokes are strong and clear despite his current condition. The beauty of the scholar&#x2019;s calligraphy is unmarred by drink.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have other things to see to while Xiaoyu here is finishing up the contract,&#x201D; says Miss Xia as she gets up. &#x201C;I will be back shortly, so please do make yourself comfortable.&#x201D; She sweeps off, leaving you and the scholar behind.<br>
<br>
He finishes faster than you expected. The way he phrased the terms are clear and concise, with no mistake as to what it entails. As you read through the contract, Xiahou Yu speaks to you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of all the places to meet again, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m surprised you still recognize me,&#x201D; you say quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alcohol makes you remember the strangest things. It draws a haze down over certain hollows in your mind, and brings out other memories to the fore. I suppose you are here to &#x2013; no, it doesn&#x2019;t matter why you are here, does it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose it doesn&#x2019;t. How did you end up here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He heaves a long sigh. After a while, he reaches into his garments and brings out a roll of paper. Looking at it wistfully, he unties the string holding it, letting the paper fall open  by itself. It is a painting of a beautiful lady in the midst of blooming peach blossom trees, her back half-turned as she looks over her shoulder. Even with your amateur&#x2019;s grasp of art, you can understand that it is a very good painting. The artist must have put his entire heart and soul into it &#x2013; you can sense the passion and longing and frustration conveyed by the painting.<br>
<br>
The second thing you notice is the lady herself. There is a familiar red mark on the right side of her face, a single flaw on her cold, imperious beauty.<br>
<br>
This is the person you have been &#x2013; should have been &#x2013; hunting.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;To be honest,&#x201D; says Xiahou Yu longingly, oblivious to your expression, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t come here just because of my clan&#x2019;s massacre, but also because of her. She said her hometown was in Yangzhou, and I thought I could find her here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How did you meet her?&#x201D; you ask, wondering just how a scholar like him could have met a murderous assassin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I saved her life,&#x201D; he said, a sad expression on his face. &#x201C;I found her near death on the outskirts of my family manor, and so I hid her and kept her safe.&#x201D; His voice trails off, a wistful gaze in his eyes as he reminisces about what seems to be happier times to him. &#x201C;Anyway,&#x201D; he sighs, &#x201C;when the manor was attacked, she rescued me, when she could have run. She fought off six men at once to save my life. Then, she left me in the middle of a forest, in darkest night, without even a word of parting. I have been seeking her ever since&#x2026; Chanfeng. Liu Chanfeng.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You suppose that is her name. &#x201C;And so you came down to Yangzhou asking about her, I suppose. What did you find?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That she used to work here,&#x201D; he shrugs. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t mind. For me it is a meeting of minds, not so much the lusts of the body.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are truly a generous man,&#x201D; you chuckle. &#x201C;Why are you still here, then, instead of going to look for her? Do you not know where she is?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think I know where she may be right now,&#x201D; he says bitterly, &#x201C;but I am trapped here. I made the mistake of indulging slightly in drink. The entire occurrence remains hazy to me, but when I woke up they stuck me with a bill for sleeping with every girl they had on duty that night.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You wince. On the way in you had caught a glimpse of the prices. They were exorbitant, to say the least.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Twice,&#x201D; adds Xiahou Yu.<br>
<br>
You can&#x2019;t help but whistle. That <i>is </i>impressive. &#x201C;Poor Brother Yu. And you are stuck here working for&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Twenty more years,&#x201D; he sighs. Then, he grabs the liquor on the table and downs it with an angry, wild expression on his face. &#x201C;If only I could flee this place&#x2026; Ah, the cage of the body and the cage of the heart; I cannot decide which is a more cruel prison!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You wonder if you should try to secure his freedom &#x2013; if your aim is to find this woman in black, it seems like Xiahou Yu is your best bet.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Spend all your money in freeing Xiahou Yu by buying his freedom from Yuhua Hall, if necessary.<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> Sneak into Yuhua Hall later that night and extract him.<br>
<br>
<b>C.</b> Deal with this in an upfront manner; threaten to take Xiahou Yu whether they like it not not.<br>
<br>
<b>D.</b> You have other things to attend to. You will gather the information by yourself.

            <h3>二十八 · Yangzhou Tales</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Yangzhou Tales</span></b><br>
<br>
Miss Xia seems reluctant to part with her prized employee, but finally agrees. By the end of the negotiations for Yu&#x2019;s freedom, you are left with not a cent to your name and a very grateful scholar. You had forfeited all payments from the deal involving Yao&#x2019;s Protective Sheath for two years in order to afford his ransom. You hope it is worth it.<br>
<br>
You return the next day and find Xiahou Yu waiting for you at the gates of Yuhua Hall. It was just a day, but his transformation is dramatic, the alcohol-fueled haze in his eyes replaced by a bright determination. He bows sharply when he sees you. &#x201C;Thank you very much for freeing me from Yuhua Hall. I am not sure how I can ever make it up to you, but please let me try!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry about that. Money is where you find it,&#x201D; you say, recalling Qi Liuwu&#x2019;s quip. &#x201C;We <i>are </i>going to have to find some, though, unless you want to be eating wild rabbit for the rest of your days.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, about that&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiahou reaches into his clothes and pulls out a small pouch. &#x201C;It is not much, but the girls in Yuhua gathered some taels together for me. It should be enough for food, though not lodging.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are surprisingly popular, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;Not bad. Your drinking must have impressed the courtesans.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I will never drink again,&#x201D; he replies quickly, a wild look in his eyes as he gulps audibly. &#x201C;Ever.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are not sure how long his resolution will hold out. Nodding, you say, &#x201C;For now, we will be travelling together. You want to meet your Liu Chanfeng again, don&#x2019;t you? I may have business with her too, so we will stick together until then.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Forgive me for intruding,&#x201D; he asks suspiciously, &#x201C;but I have been wondering; just what business do you have with her?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not interested in her <i>that</i> way. To be more specific, it is probably her friends that I have business with. Well, the sun is high and I have not yet eaten. As a mark of your gratitude, I&#x2019;ll have you treat me to a good lunch, Brother Yu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She never told me this, but here I found out that she used to be a rather popular courtesan at Yuhua Hall,&#x201D; begins Xiahou Yu as he retells the story that he has pieced together over the past two years. &#x201C;When she was eighteen, she fell in love with one of her regular customers, an influential man&#x2019;s scion by the name of Zhang Manlou. He was scum of the worst sort.&#x201D; Xiahou grits his teeth angrily. &#x201C;His godfather is one of the Grand Eunuchs of the Imperial Court, Grand Eunuch Wang.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You remember Grand Eunuch Wang well; of the four old prickless bastards that stood at the top of the court, he was probably the worst nag and the pettiest fellow of the lot &#x2013; not a day went by without him complaining about one thing or another.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As such, that scum thought himself untouchable,&#x201D; continues Xiahou. &#x201C;He toyed with Chanfeng&#x2019;s feelings and made her think that he genuinely felt for her. Then, he got her pregnant.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I thought the girls at Yuhua Hall were supposed to use protection,&#x201D; you interject.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They do, but it is not perfect. On the off chance that they do conceive, the child is taken care of by the Hall,&#x201D; replies Xiahou.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, the child&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Poor Chanfeng thought that Zhang Manlou would take responsibility, and so instead of having it in Yuhua Hall she went seeking him in his mansion in Chang&#x2019;an.&#x201D; The scholar&#x2019;s hands ball into fists as he stares at the table angrily. &#x201C;He was married, yes, but what rich man cannot afford a wife or mistress? Still, the bastard disavowed any knowledge of her, in front of his entire household. Then, he attacked her. It was the one thing she did not believe he would do. Zhang Manlou practices a neigong called the Huangu Skill (&#x9084;&#x9AA8;&#x529F;,Returning Bone Skill). The unborn child was killed. She was left with that mark on her face. She returned to Yuhua Hall for only a month, before disappearing. That was six years ago, when she was eighteen.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a deep sigh, Xiahou downs the cup of tea, though by the expression on his face he clearly finds that it is a poor substitute for wine.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve found out that she was recently spotted together with members of the Black Dragon Society, which has its headquarters in the vicinity of Xiangyang. They are a vicious bunch of mercenaries and assassins for hire&#x2026; I am not sure why Chanfeng would be with them. I have also heard that there is a small, obscure school called the Wunan Sect hidden somewhere in Shennong Forest, a few days&apos; travel from Xiangyang. Apparently they are an all-female sect, taking in those who have been betrayed by men. I feel that that is probably where she is.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It looks like no matter what, your investigation would take you to Xiangyang next. Still, you are in no real hurry to leave Yangzhou at the moment. You wonder if you should see if there is anything else to do here. Keeping an ear out for news on the grapevine, you find that&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>The most influential martial arts establishment in Yangzhou, the Zhou Clan Manor, is gathering pugilists to conduct a campaign against a band of pirates that has been terrorizing the southern coast. Payment is what you can claim from the pirates&#x2019; plunder; most pugilists are participating to make a name for themselves, however.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b> The two largest merchant clans of Yangzhou, the Dao family and the Jian family, have been feuding for generations. It looks like they may be about to go to war; this <i>could</i> be a lucrative opportunity if you stick your nose in whether as a negotiator or to help one side over another.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Nothing more in Yangzhou interests you; you think you should hurry over to Xiangyang instead and continue pursuing your lead as fast as possible.

            <h3>二十九 · Anti-Pirate Alliance</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Anti-Pirate Alliance</span></b><br>
<br>
The main hall of the Zhou Clan&#x2019;s Manor is crowded with pugilists by the time you and Xiahou Yu arrive. The two of you blend into the crowd, not wanting to cause a stir. Given the different uniforms on display, you note at least six or seven minor schools present. The masters of those schools are seated at the front of the hall. One of them looks familiar, but you cannot place him at the moment. Only one of the Eight Sects has sent representatives; Kunlun, but you do not recognize their faces. They appear to be senior to you in age. Surprisingly, you spot Miss Xia there. Why would Yuhua Hall send a representative?<br>
<br>
After some time, a distinguished, middle-aged gentleman with an elegant beard steps out from behind the main hall. He is followed by two youngsters &#x2013; one male, one female, both rather pleasing to the eye. From the looks of it, they are probably his children. The gentleman clears his throat and calls for silence. It looks like he is the master of the manor, Zhou Dingqiu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Everyone, I am pleased to have you here today at the Zhou residence. I hope that you have been greeted with the greatest courtesy by the members of my household.&#x201D; The crowd nods and murmurs in agreement; it looks like you have missed out on a free lunch earlier today. You cluck your tongue in disappointment. Zhou Dingqiu begins addressing the leaders of the minor schools, thanking them for their attendance. As he rattles off the names, you find terribly bored; they are all fodder &#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t seem like there are any pugilists of interest here. You look around the hall. Xiahou Yu is actually listening intently, but you have better things to do with your time.<br>
<br>
Then, you recognize the master you had found familiar just as his name is called, Zhou Dingqiu thanking him for coming all the way out here to help. Rong Muben of Songfeng. He stands up and bows in acknowledgement, looking rather hale and hearthy. It looks like there are some Songfeng disciples standing in the crowd too, though they have yet to notice you. You look away from him, deciding to focus on the matter in front of you first. Zhou and the various masters, as well as the Eight Sects&#x2019; representatives, finally finish their greetings and start discussing the main issue.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We are all gathered here because of the problem plaguing this prefecture&#x2019;s coastline. Wo pirates. They have been pillaging coastal villages for many months now, and no one has stood up against them.&#x201D; begins Zhou Dingqiu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, that is interesting,&#x201D; whispers Xiahou Yu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is?&#x201D; you whisper in return.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You know the Wo are the people of Nippon, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Even I know that. What is so interesting about them being pirates?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A treaty was signed sixty years ago to prevent this very thing from happening. It is a matter of foreign policy if the Wo are pirating on our shores.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, did they?&#x201D; It must have been taught to you in your studies. In fact, you recall hearing something like this, now that Yu has jogged your memory, but the details do not come to you. &#x201C;If that is the case, the prefect should be dealing with it, or should have submitted a report to the Court for action. Why is he not here, with a Tang fleet to subjugate a single band of pirates? We <i>do </i>have a navy and it has not seen any action in&#x2026; what, a century?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t know about that. It could be that he is in league with the pirates somehow,&#x201D; conjectures Xiahou Yu. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a wild guess, but the other alternatives don&#x2019;t make him look much better.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod. &#x201C;Incompetence. Why he isn&#x2019;t helping isn&#x2019;t that important right now anyway, since the sects are taking matters into their own hands.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now,&#x201D; says Zhou more loudly, apparently distracted by your whispers with Yu. &#x201C;The government will not aid us in this venture. The prefect has sent a letter detailing his approval of our actions and his gratitude, but there will be no money or ships forthcoming.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you expect us to swim there?&#x201D; shouts a rotund master. &#x201C;Sure, <i>you </i>can walk on water, but the rest of us aren&#x2019;t so capable.&#x201D; The crowd laughs as Zhou tries to calm them down. &#x201C;Master Ji, this is why Lady Xia of Yuhua Hall has kindly agreed to sponsor our campaign.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Taking money from a brothel?&#x201D; shouts a skinny master. &#x201C;Why, I would never! This is a disgrace!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; murmurs Xiahou Yu, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen him <i>give </i>money to Yuhua Hall, not take it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well then, he&#x2019;ll be a good customer for my product,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;Remind me to keep him alive so that he can continue whoring.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now now, Master Gong, we really have no choice. For the sake of the people,&#x201D; pleads Zhou Dingqiu. &#x201C;This is not a time for our pride to stand in our way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is right, Master Gong,&#x201D; says Rong Muben, joining in on Zhou Dingqiu&#x2019;s side. &#x201C;When the people are in trouble, we must help them. They are the livelihood of the country; we cannot let pride force us to reject help.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is a merely a matter of community service,&#x201D; Miss Xia speaks up. &#x201C;Yuhua Hall continues to prosper because the people <i>give </i>to it.&#x201D; She gives Master Gong a wink, sending him falling back into his chair with a red face. &#x201C;It is only natural that we give back. If you will not work with us for your sake, at least for the sake of your <i>wife</i>?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-well,&#x201D; splutters Master Gong, &#x201C;Fine. Do as you please. I have no objections.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zhou gives a sigh of relief. &#x201C;Now, I will let my son, Zhou Zhideng, explain the plan.&#x201D; The young man comes to the fore and begins talking. It is a rather basic plan that is hard to mess up &#x2013; now that they have identified the hideout of the Wo pirates, they will sneak in under cover of darkness, burn the pirate ships, and begin exterminating the scum. One on one, every pugilist should be a match for any pirate, and it seems that they outnumber the enemy at that.<br>
<br>
You notice the girl, Zhou Zhideng&#x2019;s sister, looking moody and displeased. You sigh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201D; asks Xiahou Yu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;See that girl? Zhou Dingqiu&#x2019;s daughter?&#x201D; you whisper.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, what of her?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to be trouble. I <i>know</i> how this is going to go,&#x201D; you grumble. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s going to try to sneak on board the ship and tag along for some reason or another.&#x201D; Xiahou Yu chuckles. &#x201C;Surely that cannot be true. She looks too meek to do such a thing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Trust me, brother Yu. You&#x2019;ll see.&#x201D; You sigh again.<br>
<br>
Then, the whispers begin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, wait, that boy&#x2026; Man Tiger Pig&#x2026; that&#x2019;s the Man Tiger Pig, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple!? What is he doing here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2026; can&#x2019;t be right, can it? I had heard Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple was a mountain of a boy, not a scruffy young man who looks like he has just started shaving!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, that is him! I saw him at the tournament! It&#x2019;s Man Tiger Pig!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You find yourself and Xiahou Yu in an ever-widening circle of space as the crowd backs away from you. You suppose it would be too good to be true to hope that no one would ever recognize you, but you had no intention of hiding your identity anyway. Looking confidently at Zhou Dingqiu, you bow politely in greeting, giving him your best smile.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The disciple of Zhang Jue pays his obeisance to the master of Zhou Manor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xiahou Yu follows suit quickly, calling himself a humble scholar.<br>
<br>
The entire hall is frozen, with not a soul moving an inch; none of them know what to make of your sudden appearance in their midst. Zhou Dingqiu looks at you with suspicion. Rong Muben, on the other hand, has an expression of anger, but he does not move from his seat. The Songfeng disciples jerk into action, as they finally recognize your face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is Xu Jing! Master, that&#x2019;s the murderer of our young master! Let&#x2019;s-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; roars Rong Muben. His disciples&#x2019; swords are half-drawn as they shrink back at their master&#x2019;s voice. &#x201C;I have no idea why this&#x2026; cur&#x2026; is here, but I have vowed that the Songfeng Sword School would not take vengeance for Zhiyu&#x2019;s untimely demise. I will not break that vow as long as I live! Sheathe your swords!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Heeding their master&#x2019;s orders, the disciples step back, glaring daggers at you.<br>
<br>
Up in front, Miss Xia arches an elegantly painted eyebrows at the revelation of your identity. You give her a brief shrug &#x2013; it is what it is.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now, ah, Young Master Xu,&#x201D; begins Zhou Dingqiu awkwardly, not entirely sure how to handle this mess, &#x201C;Why are you here? I hope it is not to challenge us to battle. As you can see, we are rather occupied at the moment.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh, waving your hands in denial. &#x201C;Oh, of course not. I merely heard of your manor&#x2019;s call to arms against the pirates, and decided to participate.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why would you do such a thing?&#x201D; He seems genuinely puzzled.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why can&#x2019;t I?&#x201D; you reply simply, looking straight into his eyes.<br>
<br>
Zhou does not answer, knowing that the only way to reply would be to drag your master&#x2019;s reputation into it. Then, he shakes his head, a little sad smile crossing his lips. &#x201C;Very well. I will judge you on what you do, not what your master does. It is not my position to question help, if indeed you are offering it. I have heard of your victory at the recent tournament &#x2013; you will be a strong addition to our task force. I cannot turn that away.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The hall erupts in protest at his words. It seems like no one here trusts you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They really hate you,&#x201D; whispers Xiahou Yu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They can go die in a fire,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s rather poetic. Maybe I should write it down.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Rong Muben stands up from his chair.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Rong,&#x201D; begins Zhou Dingqiu, &#x201C;where are you going?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I may not seek vengeance against that boy, but I cannot work together with him,&#x201D; he grimaces. &#x201C;I cannot even stand to see his face.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is done, Master Zhou. Songfeng will not be participating in this assault. It would sully my integrity if I cooperated with my son&#x2019;s killer.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that pride I hear speaking?&#x201D; you call out. Rong Muben turns around, glowering at you wordlessly. You continue, &#x201C;Is the suffering of the people less important than your integrity, Master Rong?&#x201D; One of the Songfeng disciples steps up. &#x201C;I hate to say this, but if we leave now, Master, we are only going to let this bastard win. Perhaps that is what he wants, to drive this alliance apart. Maybe we should&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You only laugh, looking around you casually. All of the pugilists seem to be on guard, ready to fight at a moment&#x2019;s notice. &#x201C;What is this? Are all of you going to pile on me? Who will make the first move? I do not think this is a good start to your anti-pirate alliance if you start losing people even before you set foot on the island.&#x201D; They back away nervously as your gaze meets theirs; no matter what, your reputation <i>does</i> precede you, and these are merely a bunch of fodder schools compared to the Eight Sects. Of course, being a major sect doesn&#x2019;t seem to stop the Kunlun representatives from looking worried as you grin at them.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Look,&#x201D; says Zhou Zhideng, trying to help his father salvage the situation. &#x201C;Can everyone just calm down? I have seen Man Tiger Pig in battle. I do not think he is here to cause trouble, and I think he will be of great help.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You already have,&#x201D; whispers Xiahou Yu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That I have,&#x201D; you nod knowingly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Please, listen to my father,&#x201D; says the young master of Zhou Manor. &#x201C;We must not underestimate the pirates even if everything appears to be going right for us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If&#x2026;&#x201D; says Zhou Dingqiu heavily, &#x201C;if Young Master Xu is willing to promise his good behaviour, will you all accept his participation?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The old man is trying to speak for you. Your first instinct is to interrupt him, but Xiahou Yu tugs at your arm. &#x201C;Wait,&#x201D; he hisses.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Or perhaps he can take us on in a <i>friendly </i>match. No grudges,&#x201D; says one of the Songfeng disciples heatedly. &#x201C;If he wins, he gets to participate. If he loses, he gets out of here immediately.&#x201D; Zhou Dingqiu looks taken aback at the idea of having a fight right now, but does not say anything for now. Master Gong speaks up suddenly, deciding to get involved. &#x201C;How about we have a competition for the head of the Wo leader? We can settle the grudge that way, instead of fighting in Zhou Manor. If Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple wins, it&#x2019;s all good. If we win, it&#x2019;s all good too!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The hall seems to like Master Gong&#x2019;s idea &#x2013; Songfeng aside, none of them seem overly keen to fight you. Still, to be chased out by them now - to retreat - is an idea that irks you too much to even consider...<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You decide to take on the Songfeng disciples in a &#x2018;friendly&#x2019; match. It will not please Zhou Dingqiu, but backing down from their direct challenge will make you look like a coward in front of everyone. Besides, it&#x2019;s about time you settled things with them.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You take the challenge of being the first to claim the head of the Wo leader. This should be able to satisfy everyone except Songfeng; some of them may start to say that you backed down out of fear of them.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You back down and promise your good behaviour to avoid any further trouble. This will only satisfy the Zhou Clan. You are not going to be taunted into any challenge &#x2013; you are here to check out the pirate activity and perhaps subdue it, nothing more. You do not care whether a bunch of minnows think you soft.

            <h3>三十 · A Maiden&#039;s Request</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">A Maiden&#x2019;s Request</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Gong&#x2019;s proposition sounds interesting,&#x201D; you say, directing your words at the Songfeng disciples. &#x201C;Rather than fighting each other, turning Zhou Manor into the site of a bloodbath, and risking the success of the mission, why don&#x2019;t we make this into a challenge? Reach the pirate leader before I do, and take his head, and you can say that you have bested me. I will agree to that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As the other pugilists quietly pressure the Songfeng disciples to agree, Rong Muben speaks up. &#x201C;That will be an acceptable condition. Still, I am sorry, Master Zhou, but I cannot participate in this personally. However, I will instruct my disciples to give you their utmost cooperation.&#x201D; Having said his piece, he steps back and returns to his seat, a sour look on his face. His students, similarly irate, mumble their agreement, though they mutter accusations of cowardice under their breath. You smile at them and give the customary salute of an open palm over closed fist. They do not return it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good,&#x201D; sighs Zhou Dingqiu in relief. &#x201C;That is settled, then. The preparations are well underway, and we will depart in a day&#x2019;s time. If any of you have any further questions, you will always be welcome at my manor.&#x201D; With that, the gathering disperses. Many are still uneasy at your participation, throwing suspicious glances at you as they leave. It does not really matter to you one way or another though &#x2013; once the mission commences, acting in concert with the orthodox pugilists would only serve to slow you down.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Making your way through the streets of Yangzhou, you begin heading back towards the ramshackle hut that now serves as your temporary lodgings. Reaching a narrow street corner, you turn into the narrow alley suddenly, pulling Yu along with you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201D; he asks.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s happening sooner than I expected.&#x201D; You gesture at him to move further in. Then, you wait.<br>
<br>
You hear footsteps approaching your position, their pace picking up now that they are  After a few seconds, the owner of the footsteps appears. She gives a gasp when she sees you waiting for her in the alley, taking an involuntary step backwards.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Miss Zhou.&#x201D; You give her a curt greeting. &#x201C;A rather bold thing for a young maiden to do, running after two men in broad daylight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She shakes her head and frowns at you. &#x201C;I was going to call out to you when we reached a more appropriate place to discuss matters. I suppose this place is appropriate enough.&#x201D; Without any hint of worry, she steps into the alley, giving you a stare as if daring you to do your worst.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, to come after me alone you have more balls than any of the Songfeng disciples at least,&#x201D; you murmur. &#x201C;What is it that you want to discuss?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Miss Zhou nods and begins. &#x201C;I have a request-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re asking why? You haven&#x2019;t even heard my request yet!&#x201D; she says, looking puzzled.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You want me to take you to the pirates&#x2019; island?&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How did you know that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You sigh. &#x201C;A lucky guess.&#x201D; You are probably the only person she could ask, after all, and her intentions were rather transparent from her expressions during the meeting. &#x201C;Why do you want to go there, and how do you think I can help you? Keep your replies to four words.&#x201D; Xiahou Yu laughs in approval.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;To rescue a friend,&#x201D; she replies quickly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who is this friend?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Childhood friend, merchant&#x2019;s daughter,&#x201D; says the girl again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Captured by the pirates?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, she went willingly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why did she go?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She married a pirate.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait, what?&#x201D; This does not seem to be going the way you expected it to go. You had thought that the young mistress of Zhou Manor was going along to prove her skills, sick of being cloistered in the manor, or some such similar story.  &#x201C;That means <i>she&#x2019;s</i> also a pirate now, right? More or less.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, so I want to rescue her from the attack tomorrow.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Which means&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can have a boat prepared within the hour. If you are willing to assist me, we will set sail for Tielou Island tonight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re basically asking me to warn the pirates that an attack is coming,&#x201D; you say in disbelief. &#x201C;An attack planned by your own father, because you want to save the life of your friend.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that wrong? From what I&apos;ve heard, the pirates are only pillaging to survive. At any rate, what is important to me is getting my friend away from the island.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, ethically and legally, yes,&#x201D; interjects Xiahou Yu. &#x201C;In so far as deeds are accomplished, they should be accomplished for the greater good. The pirates plunder what is not rightfully theirs and inflict suffering upon the populace. The needs of the many outweigh the life of one person.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Miss Zhou peers at him, before saying, &#x201C;Hey, didn&#x2019;t I see you walking the streets one time in nothing but a sackcloth?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do not remember,&#x201D; he says flatly. It must have been one of his episodes &#x2013; you probably do not want to give him any more access to alcohol any time soon, even if he has vowed to never drink it again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I don&#x2019;t see why you need us along,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She may be my friend, but that does not mean that I would like to walk into their den alone. Even if I can protect myself, I would feel safer with more fighters on my side,&#x201D; she explains.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right. Does your friend speak their language?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not as far as I know.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do any of them speak <i>our </i>language?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; she says, shaking her head. If her friend had married one of them <i>surely </i>they could communicate somehow&#x2026; right?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know a bit of the Nippon language that the Wo speak,&#x201D; says Xiahou Yu. &#x201C;I studied it for a few weeks as part of my self-education on foreign policy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My friend, the brilliant scholar. Whatever would I do without you?&#x201D; you say with a strained chuckle. &#x201C;What will you do if we refuse, Miss Zhou?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What can I do? I may have to take matters into my own hands, but that will be no concern of yours,&#x201D; she says politely. You are not exactly sure what she <i>will </i>do; perhaps she might chance going it alone, perhaps she might not. That is no concern of yours, is it?<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You agree and go along with her to meet the pirates before the mission begins. It will be extremely risky, but it will give you the chance to turn adversity into opportunity. You can decide what to do with the pirates after you set foot on the island &#x2013; this will give you a headstart on the other pugilists anyway.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You attempt to convince her that you can save her friend on the day of the attack itself. She will definitely still insist on coming along, which means that you will have to find a way to sneak her onboard the ship underneath her father&#x2019;s nose. If he finds out... well, you think you might be swimming back to the mainland.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You report her plans to her father so that he keeps an eye on her. This is far too risky a plan for any maiden to conduct. By having Zhou Dingqiu place her under lock and key, she should be kept safe and out of harm&#x2019;s way during the mission. You might still keep an eye out for her friend, but that won&apos;t be your priority.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You reject her proposal, but do not do anything else. There is no need to undertake extra measures for this particular mission &#x2013; what will be will be.

            <h3>三十一 · The Pirate in Black</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<span style="color: #000000">Ninja update.<br>
</span><br>
<b>***<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Pirate in Black</span></b><br>
<br>
Xiahou Yu had done a bit of digging into the merchant&#x2019;s daughter before the both of you boarded the boat; he found out that the girl had actually been saved from a pirate attack before this, and claimed that her current husband was the one that did so. It seems that this particular band has both been raiding and also establishing their dominance in the area by driving out other pirates. Unfortunately most of the stories told of their raids were full of embellishment; the scholar and you just did not have the time to dig out the truth of their capabilities. You would just have to go in and adapt on the fly.<br>
<br>
The boat had turned out to be a rather old junk that belonged to the Zhou family &#x2013; before departure you had feared that it would capsize and send you all to the bottom of the ocean, but the servant handling it was an experienced and elderly sailor that managed to bring you through the rough seas with no loss of anything other than Yu&#x2019;s dinner. He comes up to you, still pale from the ride.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, why are we doing this again?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Because it&#x2019;s more fun this way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You pull on the pig&#x2019;s mask and head out.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Travelling through the forest, you find some freshly made traps scattered along the forest floor. After nearly falling into a pitfall, you decide to take to the treetops.<br>
<br>
It does not take you long to find signs of the pirates. Perched from your vantage point atop the trees, you spot a large collection of sturdy huts. Torches burn around the perimeter, forming a circle against the darkness. It does not look like the hideout you had been expecting &#x2013; in fact, it appears to be a village, judging from the tools lined up neatly here and there. From the furrows dug some way out, they seem to have been attempting to farm here. You wonder if this village was here before the pirates came, and if they merely appropriated it.<br>
<br>
A pinprick of light catches your eye in the distance. It is soon followed by other lights, forming a line &#x2013; from the colour of the light, those are probably torches, carried by hand. You head towards them, leaping from tree to tree amidst the chirping of the crickets.<br>
<br>
You see a line of women and children heading deeper into the woods, with large bundles bound to their back. There are perhaps sixty, maybe seventy of them. Prisoners? Upon a second look, you decide that is not the case. They are unguarded, though you note some of the women are carrying bows and have positioned themselves in a protective formation around the line. From their manner of clothing they are not Han; they could be the pirates&#x2019; family members. It seems that they are carrying their possessions with them - an evacuation, perhaps? Faint fragments of their conversation floats to your ear, carried by the wind, but you do not understand a single word.<br>
<br>
Thus far you have not seen an actual pirate here. As you are wondering what you should do next, you feel something off.<br>
<br>
For just an instant, the cricket chirps faded&#x2026; behind you.<br>
<br>
You whirl around just in time to block a chop aimed at the back of your neck. You raise your other arm to retaliate, but your assailant is already gone, your fingers clawing at shadows. Your hackles rise as your instinct warns you that it is dangerous to stay still. You move.<br>
<br>
Pushing off from the branches, you leap towards another tree. The moon is dark tonight; there will be no light to help you. Luckily, you have your ears.<br>
<br>
Crickets cease their chirping when they sense something moving towards them. From  your experience spending nights in the jungle, you know that they are extremely sensitive &#x2013; it was by listening to the crickets that you managed to stalk the beasts successfully. As an aside, you tried to stalk Master Zhang with this tactic &#x2013; it was not successful, simply because his mere presence terrorized every single cricket in the area into silence.<br>
<br>
Of course, it works both ways; your own movement will invariably betray you to those who know how to listen.<br>
<br>
You spot a blur of darkness, blacker than its surroundings, but before that the song of the crickets have already changed. You dodge your assailant easily enough, but yet again, before you are able to retaliate he has already melted into the shadows. There is no doubt that he is also listening &#x2013; in the dark forest men&#x2019;s eyes are more hindrance than help, eager to be tricked by the faint light.<br>
<br>
Again, an exchange of blows, none hitting their mark. You continue to listen to the crickets, attempting to locate your target. As he moves, so do you &#x2013; climbing up trees, hanging from branches, crouching behind rocks and roots; it is becoming a battle of prediction as the both of you manoeuvre to gain a position where you can lay in wait to strike at your moving opponent. The hunter, however, refuses to become the hunted &#x2013; all of your tricks fail one by one. The decoy, the misstep, the bait; none of them seem to work on your opponent. It irks you to admit it, but he seems to be better at the silent game than you are.<br>
<br>
You&#x2019;ll just have to change the nature of the game. If you can&#x2019;t beat him in stealth, you&#x2019;ll just have to lure him out via other means.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m impressed,&#x201D; you call out. &#x201C;Perhaps we can exchange pointers about crickets?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nothing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you one of the pirates?&#x201D; Perhaps it would be better to confirm the identity of your assailant.<br>
<br>
Still nothing. You laugh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m standing  right here, but you aren&#x2019;t going to do anything?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No,&#x201D; whispers a man&#x2019;s voice next to your ear hoarsely, his tone deep and serious. He doesn&#x2019;t sound young; perhaps middle-aged. You freeze up in shock, unable to keep your composure; <i>when did he get behind you</i>? Before you can react, a strong arm wraps around your throat and pulls up, forcing your head into a chokehold. You had been listening all the while, even when you were talking. There had been no change in the volume of the crickets at all. He shouldn&#x2019;t have been able to sneak up on you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You focus too much on the crickets,&#x201D; he says, as if reading your thoughts. His Han is heavily accented,  &#x201C;Rookie mistake. There are ways of moving that even the crickets cannot feel.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, well,&#x201D; you choke out, &#x201C;it worked out for me in the end, didn&#x2019;t it? Got you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You act before he can respond, reaching behind you and grasping his shoulders. From this position you should be able to hurl him. Bracing your feet against the ground, you tug with all your might, summoning your internal strength to assist you. The man shifts his posture.<br>
<br>
It is like pulling a mountain. He does not budge.<br>
<br>
His chokehold on you loosens, however, and you immediately take that advantage to slip out of it. As you draw away, you are pulled to a halt by his hand, locked around your elbow in a grip that you cannot escape. You grin. Perfect. You return the favour by grabbing his forearm. For the first time, you get a good look at your assailant. He is clad from head to toe in black just like you are, with only his eyes exposed. The man is definitely a master of some sort &#x2013;he does not flinch as your fingers fail to dig into his flesh. For just a brief instant you wonder if you may have overreached, but doubting yourself is just too boring when you could instead start trading blows with your masked assailant.<br>
<br>
However, he does not seem to have any intent of the sort. With an intricate movement, he frees himself from your grasp like a snake shedding its skin. Within moments he has vanished again. This time, however, he doesn&#x2019;t continue the attack.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are a fighter from the Central Plains, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, now you want to talk? That&#x2019;s fine by me,&#x201D; you say, though you can&#x2019;t help but shift your eyes around you warily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We do not want any trouble with you. Would you be willing to leave?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sure.&#x201D; You will have to think of a way to overcome this sentry, but it should be doable, one way or another.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You do not mean it,&#x201D; comes the reply, though you cannot tell where it is coming from.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course I do,&#x201D; you chuckle.<br>
<br>
You feel the point of a blade against the hollow of your throat almost instantly. Again, you were entirely unable to detect him. There is no killing intent emanating from the black figure in front of you, but you have no doubt that if push comes to shove that blade is going to go through your throat if you even twitch the wrong way.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are very skilled for your age, but overly playful. No more games, boy. This is a bad time for us, and I am in no mood for tricks. Answer my question. You are a fighter from the mainland, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod slowly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;For me, there are two options which my lord has entrusted me with. The first is for you to leave the island. Departing on a boat, alive, or floating away as a corpse, it does not matter to me which. The second is to bring you to meet with him.  Having tested your skills I am not too willing to take that risk, but I believe that is what my lord really wishes. I am undecided, boy. What do you think?&#x201D; whispers the man, his eyes cold and deadly.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You ask to depart the island safely. This is not a foe you can defeat right now. It may be better for you to wait until the pugilists arrive. You can just wait on the boat, a good distance away, for their arrival. Safety in numbers; once they are here they can serve as a decoy for you. It will definitely be easier to take the head of the pirate leader that way.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You ask to meet with the leader. It may be a trap of some sort, or the pirate leader may have something planned, but something about all this doesn&#x2019;t seem right to you, and you think you need more understanding of the situation. Given this man&#x2019;s skills, you don&#x2019;t think it will be easy for you to escape should you travel right into their den, however.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You attack him out of the blue, banking on your agility to evade his point-blank thrust. If it doesn&#x2019;t work you are definitely dead, but you would rather die than be sent off packing in humiliation, or be brought to meet his leader.

            <h3>三十二 · The Pirate Leader</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Pirate Leader</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll speak to your leader. Take me to him,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
The man is silent. &#x201C;Not a choice I would agree with,&#x201D; he says, finally. &#x201C;Very well. Try to keep up.&#x201D; In a blur, he vanishes, the bushes seemingly untouched in his wake. You follow, making a bit more noise in comparison as you run through the forest. He leads you back to where you had seen the line of women and children earlier on, though you are headed in a slightly different direction to where they had went. Further in, you come across a small cave entrance, guarded by two spearmen of military bearing. The man speaks a few quick sentences to them in their foreign tongue, and the guards bow before standing aside to allow you entry.<br>
<br>
You are forced to duck to enter the cave; it is a narrow squeeze, but a few steps in the space widens out more comfortably. You stumble, your hands grasping the wet rock to steady your feet. &#x201C;You cannot see?&#x201D; asks the man, somewhere in the darkness ahead of you. You wonder how he can make his way around in such total absence of light. There is the sound of shifting cloth, then a quiet scratch, and a slow glow appears in front of you. The man passes you a small torch. &#x201C;I am sorry,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Sometimes I forget. Come, now that you have light, move faster.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After a few more twists and turns through the narrow rock corridors, you finally see light in front of you, at the end of the tunnel. You follow the man out into a small, earthen room, well-lit by numerous torches. The air is damp; you can smell the sea. The room seems to have been decorated after the fashion of a war room of some sort &#x2013; there are long, white and blue banners strung down from the ceiling, while a map of the coast is pinned up across a wooden board at the end of the room. Men in scaled cuirasses sit cross-legged in a neat line on both sides of the room, their posture straight and firm. At the center of the room stands a young man, similarly protected in that foreign armour. A curved sword hangs by his side; you recognize it as a wodao, commonly used by his people. His bearing marks him as one used to command. A map of the island is rolled out across the floor and he is placing small wooden checkers across it in a simulation of what you can only think to be the coming battle.<br>
<br>
The man escorting you goes to his knees in front of the youth, confirming your suspicions about his identity. They exchange words in their tongue; the pirate leader&#x2019;s eyes flick towards you for a few seconds and back to his subordinate. Suddenly, one of his men begins shouting at you, getting up and gesticulating angrily. You do not understand a word, so unfortunately all you can do is look back at him and smile bemusedly. He takes a step forward, his manner threatening. His sword is halfway out from its sheath when your hand flashes forward and grips him by the throat. He chokes and sputters, his eyes shining with panic as he tries to breath. As one, the room reacts, men leaping to their feet and placing one hand on their swords. You note, however, that the man who had intercepted you in the forest, and the leader himself, remain rather unmoved.<br>
<br>
You grin under your mask, saying, &#x201C;Unfortunately I am not well-educated enough to speak the language of Nippon. Could anyone versed in Han convey this message? Find a better way to test me.&#x201D; The leader that barks out a command. They heed it instantly, returning to their positions on the floor. You release the man you are holding by the throat, allowing him to cough as he retreats.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was a misunderstanding,&#x201D; says the pirate leader in Han. Then, he speaks another sentence in his language, gesturing at his men to leave. Though the man in black does not move from his liege&#x2019;s side, all of the other pirates bow to their leader and file out of the room through a different entrance from the one you used.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now that we are alone here, will you take off your mask and give me your name, warrior?&#x201D; asks the leader. &#x201C;I find it disconcerting to have to talk to that&#x2026; visage.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh, pulling off the pig&#x2019;s mask. &#x201C;I suppose I could allow you that courtesy. You may call me Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The young man repeats your name, attempting to get the pronunciation right.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, so he was masked, my lord? I thought there was something wrong about his head,&#x201D; muses the man in black as he unravels his own mask, revealing an older man of about fifty. &#x201C;Was I correct about his age, however?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed, uncle Yoriwaka, on both accounts. It surprises me, that the pugilists would send someone so young as a scout.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You had not figured it out in the dark, but out here in the light, you realize that the man in black, Yoriwaka, is blind. He makes a good show of disguising it; he blinks and shifts his eyes around just like a seeing person would, but if anyone paid enough attention they could notice the subtle differences.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, you know about the pugilists? You are rather well-informed for a pirate leader.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your people were not hiding their advertisements for fighters to join a pirate hunt. I would be no leader if I did not keep an eye on the movements of those we have wronged and seek to do wrong upon us in return,&#x201D; sighs the young man. &#x201C;I am Yorimitsu of the Minamoto clan. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Xu Jing.&#x201D; You think you have heard of that clan before &#x2013; they were supposed to be some big shots in Japan, equivalent to nobility. If only the scholar were here right now; he&#x2019;d probably remember more than you do.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is a member of a famed clan doing all the way out here as a pirate? Is it at the behest of your government?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
Yorimitsu laughs. &#x201C;If you think Nippon is attempting to invade, you have thought wrong. We are exiles, cast away from the court due to brotherly strife. I, and fifty of my loyal retainers, as well as their family, were sent away from our homeland, never to return. We sought refuge at the Tang court, but all they granted us was this island, Tetsuhashi.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We had not heard of that,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;At least, everyone is certain that you are nothing more than low-born pirates.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The prefect of Yangzhou, at least, knows of us, and he exacts tribute in return for the navy turning a blind eye to our deeds. Furthermore, your eunuchs and ministers did not want to be seen as interfering with the internal affairs of other nations. It was not widely announced, and this island was of no value to anyone. A perfect place to dump some political exiles and forget about them. But we had to take what we could get. We were in no position to negotiate.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And so you resorted to piracy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not by choice, but necessity. I will apologize for the harm we have caused to your people, and I do not claim my actions are righteous or just, but I do not regret taking those measures. We have tried and failed to farm here time after time. My duty is to my retainers and their families. If that means I have to take from your people to feed my own, I will do so.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why not just settle on the mainland? If you managed to found a village on this island, it should not be too difficult to eke out a living on more fertile ground.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have considered that option, but there are two problems standing in the way. Firstly, after so many months we have yet to identify a suitable location nearby on the mainland. None of the villages will take us in &#x2013; we have tried, and failed, to even trade with them, before resorting to raids. I am afraid foreigners are not very welcomed here. The city&#x2019;s market is different, but no less useless to us &#x2013; there are powerful merchants linked to the prefect that have barred us from trading. Understandable, as some of them do business in my home country and they would not want to incur the displeasure of the Taira. Secondly, if we were to venture further inland, we would not have the supplies necessary to make the long march. I hear that bandits are rife upon the roads, and the total number of women, children and elderly I have to protect number nearly two hundred. Why would I risk the lives of my people when we have begun getting comfortable here?&#x201D; declares Yorimitsu.<br>
<br>
You scratch your head, sighing. &#x201C;Then why did you express a desire to meet me? What do you think I can do for you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was obvious that they would send a scout beforehand - it is only prudent to do so on the eve of an attack. If I were lucky, the scout that came would be a reasonable person. Given uncle Yoriwaka&#x2019;s account of your skills, you must be a highly respected pugilist despite your age, probably a warrior of some renown, if you were entrusted with the mission to scout the battleground by yourself. I hope that you will warn your fellows to leave the island. We are fully prepared for their attack; any battle will exact grievous casualties on both sides.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
If he thinks you are a highly respected pugilist, he must not have done enough research. He might be regretting that very soon. You laugh again. &#x201C;You sound like a bright leader. At least, you seem to have given all this more thought than I have,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Why, it almost sounds like if you are gone, your people will fall apart in very short order.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is a correct assessment,&#x201D; he says calmly in response to your veiled threat. &#x201C;If taking my head could solve this conflict, I would offer it gladly. However, I do not see any alternative that strikes me with enough confidence to leave my people to their own means. My task is not yet done. That is why I ask for your aid. You will be well compensated &#x2013; we have kept some treasures from the pirates that were here before us. I only require that you convince the pugilists to turn around and leave.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Even if you do so, there would still be the problem of their piracy to handle - as long as they were raiding, they would face the risk of reprisal. Chasing the pugilists away is not a long term solution. Of course, you could think about that after you talk to the pugilists for him... or you could settle the problem once and for all right now.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will side with the Minamoto and attempt to negotiate a deal for the pugilists to leave. Of course, given that your reputation is hardly that of &#x2018;highly respected&#x2019; in their eyes, as Yorimitsu seems to think it is... this will not be easy. In fact, you think your chances of negotiating are so low that you would probably fare better attempting to beat them all down by yourself, but if that is what Lord Yorimitsu wants...<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You ask about Miss Zhou&#x2019;s friend &#x2013; you will send her away with Miss Zhou and the boat. They will not cross paths with the pugilist fleet, but at least this way they will not be here if fighting does break out.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You ask to bring Miss Zhou here &#x2013; she will definitely be of use in &#x2018;negotiations&#x2019;. You do not think she will be able to convince her father by herself, but you have the added option of making a more persuasive argument of your own if you have her &apos;hostage&apos;.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Taking his head will solve matters; at least, it will solve matters for you. You may have been at a disadvantage in the dark, but in the light you are confident things will be different. You attack Yorimitsu. Once he is dead, his people should be scattered and unable to muster any reasonable resistance, leaving them easy pickings for the pugilists when they arrive.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You decide not to take sides for now. You ask for Miss Zhou&#x2019;s friend &#x2013; judging from his personality, Yorimitsu has no real reason to keep her here in an impending attack, and take her back to the ship. Then, you will wait and see how the battle plays out before deciding how you should act.

            <h3>三十三 · Cove Confrontation</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cove Confrontation</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is the meaning of this?&#x201D; asks Zhou Dingqiu, standing at the head of a hundred fighters. They had been forced to change their plans upon spotting you awaiting them at the cove where the pirate ships had been moored. Instead of coming onshore quietly to scuttle the ships, Zhou had decided that his element of surprise was likely lost. Of course, it was lost from the start. &#x201C;When you didn&#x2019;t showed up, I thought something like this would happen. Have you taken the pirate leader&#x2019;s head before us?&#x201D; asks Master Gong. You shake your head. &#x201C;Nothing so easy as that. I&#x2019;m here to warn you,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;It turns out that the pirates have <i>already </i>known of your coming from the start.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How could they have-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re going to advertise your recruitment publicly in the city, <i>anyone </i>would know about it,&#x201D; you interrupt. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid that pressing on right now is only going to result in pointless deaths. They are prepared for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter, does it? Unless you&#x2019;re a coward,&#x201D; taunts some nameless Songfeng disciple.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It matters because this fight appears to be rather pointless,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How so? You seem to know something we don&#x2019;t,&#x201D; remarks Zhou Zhideng, the scion of the Zhou clan. He seems worried that things are not going to plan. You nod and begin to explain what you have found out, carefully leaving out his daughter&#x2019;s plan so as not to incite any more unwarranted excitement, as well as Yorimitsu&#x2019;s offer of a reward. After you have finished, Zhou sighs deeply and says, &#x201C;A strange story indeed. I am not sure what to think, having sailed all the way out here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all a lie! He&#x2019;s failed to take their leader&#x2019;s head and now he seeks to scare us off doing the same so that he will not lose face!&#x201D; shouts one of the pugilists. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t fall for Man Tiger Pig&#x2019;s lies! He&#x2019;s only backpedalling now because he put his own reputation at stake!&#x201D; A chorus of agreement echoes amongst the crowd, such is your reputation for trickery that they are eager to believe you are not telling the truth.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you do not trust me, I can show you the village, and their people. I can arrange for an audience with their leader, too,&#x201D; you offer.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He&#x2019;s just going to lead us into a trap!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yeah, don&#x2019;t trust him! I say we go ahead and show him the power of the orthodox sects, doing what he has failed to do!&#x201D; As one the crowd surges forward, but when you fail to budge even an inch in the face of their advance, their steps falter. You grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will say this &#x2013; if you go forth, you will die, and I will not even have to move a finger.&#x201D; It is not a lie. The Minamoto had already set archers in position, having spotted the pugilists&#x2019; approach from far away. They would have been met by a hail of arrows had they proceeded with their original plan of setting fire to the ships. Thankfully the archers seem to be disciplined enough to refrain from a volley until you have exhausted your options &#x2013; but if you fail to turn them away here, you have no doubt they will fire.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Please, listen to him, father! Brother!&#x201D; The young lady of Zhou Manor, Zhou Zixia, runs out besides you. The scholar runs after her, helplessly asking her to wait. This <i>wasn&#x2019;t </i>the time for her to make her appearance. Zhou Dingqiu&#x2019;s face darkens when he sees his daughter. His son steps forward, surprised. &#x201C;Sister! What are you doing here? I thought-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
Zixia tries to support your story, but she is drowned out by a shout from her father. &#x201C;Enough! This is shameful behaviour indeed! Zixia, come over here. This is no way for a respectable lady to behave &#x2013; you promised me that you would stay obediently! And you, Xu Jing, I thought better of you. I suspected that she might try asking you for help with her foolish errand, but I did not think her actually silly enough to try, and you disreputable enough to accept!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father, perhaps it was nothing more than coincidence. We should reconsider-&#x201D; begins Zhideng, but Zhou Dingqiu shakes his head angrily. &#x201C;This has shamed our entire clan. I must apologise to all the brave fighters here for showing such an embarrassing side of our family. Dirty linen should not have been aired in public.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is alright, Master Zhou,&#x201D; says Master Ji awkwardly, &#x201C;but what do we do now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The pirates have broken the law, and caused suffering,&#x201D; he replies. &#x201C;That is the truth. For these foreigners to come to our land and pillage our property is inexcusable, no matter what reasons they may have. This is <i>not </i>their country.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Down with the foreign devils!&#x201D; shouts a Songfeng disciple that you mark and decide will go down first when the fighting starts.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Will matters be solved with just my life alone?&#x201D; To your surprise, Yorimitsu appears, stepping out of the darkness in full battle regalia. His uncle does not seem to be anywhere nearby, but you have no doubt that the man is watching and ready to strike. Unexpected things are happening faster than you can respond; this is not what you had in mind. &#x201C;I am Yorimitsu of the Minamoto, leader of my people on this island. The responsibility is mine to bear. If I fall here, will you judge justice served?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why would that be, young man?&#x201D; snorts Master Gong. &#x201C;We have no guarantee your people will not continue to pirate. Who would trust the word of a pirate?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not even if I lay down my life to bind an oath?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your oaths have no value to us, Wo,&#x201D; says Zhou Dingqiu. &#x201C;This problem must be solved, and solved decisively. When the grass is cut the roots must be plucked. The Imperial Court has expressed their desire to clean up the coast and free the people from the plague of piracy. Though they are not able or willing to do it directly, as loyal subjects the orthodox sects are more than willing to do it on the Emperor&#x2019;s behalf. I am afraid this can only end in one way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; murmurs Yorimitsu, his hand laid on his sword. The crowd tenses. You rather suspect arrows will begin flying at any moment.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you fight now, your daughter will be caught up in the fighting,&#x201D; you point out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You-&#x201C; grimaces Zhou Dinqiu, his expression full of anger. &#x201C;Are you threatening me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not! I would not dare, Master Zhou,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I am merely pointing out something to watch out for.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A daughter that would rebel against her father to such an extent is no daughter of mine,&#x201D; he scowls, though you can tell he does not mean his words. Still, he seems resolved to go on the attack. &#x201C;For that matter, Xu Jing, why are you siding with these Wo? Are you betraying your own country?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not siding with them,&#x201D; you reply, &#x201C;merely trying to prevent needless loss of life. Would you serve your country better by continuing to live, or by bleeding out here by the sea? What can you accomplish if you drive these people to extinction? Will there be no more raids? Of course not. There will always be pirates.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is right,&#x201D; Xiahou Yu speaks out, having found his courage from somewhere &#x2013; you stare at him as you catch a whiff of just <i>where </i>he had found his courage. Hopefully he had not partook of <i>too </i>much courage. &#x201C;Even if you stamp out these pirates, more will come. Can you hire boats every month, every year, trying to keep them under control? Piracy is a symptom of the greater disease that ails our empire, not a cause. It is not the pirates we must strive against! It is those who have strayed from the Will of Heaven!&#x201D; Ah, yes. He definitely took too much. You resist the urge to bury your head in the sand. Even though you agree with him, this is <i>not </i>the time and place to speak out against the government.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Treason! He speaks treason!&#x201D; screams the pugilists.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They have betrayed us to the foreign devils! Gut them all!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It looks like this will all spiral into a fight rather soon. Yorimitsu is on edge, as are the pugilists. &#x201C;I thank you for your efforts,&#x201D; mutters the young Minamoto leader, &#x201C;but it seems that it was a lost cause in the first place. You have my apologies for getting you involved in this &#x2013; my own judgment was lacking. You should leave now. I would not ask you to turn your sword on your own people. I will arrange for your payment, so do not worry about that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You accept Yorimitsu&#x2019;s offer and leave, returning Zixia to her father. You will have no part in what is to come. Best to retreat and let them sort it out themselves; you have no obligations to them. It seems that the idea for this campaign actually originated from within the Court; you are under no impressions that they are a monolithic bloc, but as you have no idea of just which factions are behind this and what games they are playing, you do not want to get involved any further.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You take Miss Zhou hostage to force all attention back to you. From there you can dictate your terms. It is unlikely that you can force unilateral retreat, but a challenge would be acceptable. You are still a member of the <i>jianghu</i> yourself, and they will find it hard to turn down. The best way would be to challenge all of them &#x2013; one at a time, all at once, they can come at you however they wish. If the pirates kill even a single pugilist, things will never be salvaged. Of course, if you mess up you are probably dead.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You decide to fight alongside the Minamoto pirates to repel the pugilists. It is probably safer and less risky this way for yourself, and it would result in less loss of life in comparison to letting them sort it out themselves. By ending the fight decisively at the cove and turning them away before they get deeper into the island, you can minimize the bloodshed.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You decide to fight alongside the pugilists, turning on Yorimitsu and taking his head. You are close enough to do so quickly, before any intervention can happen. This is for the best &#x2013; with a brutal show of force, if you are on the side of the pugilists, you could at least prevent an outright massacre from happening when they descend upon his womenfolk and children.

            <h3>三十四 · Hundred Man Battle</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hundred Man Battle</span></b><br>
<br>
You beckon at Zhou Zixia to come closer to you; she does so hurriedly, perhaps thinking that you have some plan to solve this little predicament. Well, she&#x2019;s not wrong. You seize her by the neck, putting her into a chokehold. &#x201C;Wh-what are you doing?&#x201D; she cries out. You hadn&#x2019;t rehearsed it with her beforehand, but her shock helps drive the point home. Zhou Dingqiu shouts out in concern for his daughter instantly as everyone&#x2019;s attention turns to you. You move into the torchlight, making sure everyone sees where you are.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alright, that&#x2019;s just about enough,&#x201D; you call out, holding the girl tight against her struggles to break free. &#x201C;You bore me, all of you. If you don&#x2019;t want this cute young maiden here to get hurt, listen carefully to what I have to say.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is &#x2013; this is preposterous!&#x201D; exclaims Zhou Dingqiu. &#x201C;How vile can you be!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This much, I would say.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you think you are going to force us to leave by taking my daughter hostage-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not, Master Zhou. That would be entirely too boring. No, I have in mind something much more entertaining.&#x201D; Yorimitsu stares at you for a second before bowing in gratitude and retreating. You push Zixia away, towards the scholar. He catches her &#x2013; knowing what you have in mind, he draws a dagger and holds it to her throat. &#x201C;Listen to Xu Jing or Miss Zhou here is going to bleed out all over the sand!&#x201D; he shouts, a bit too convincingly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, don&#x2019;t <i>actually</i> do it,&#x201D; you whisper.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, right. Of course,&#x201D; nods Yu seriously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You scoundrel!&#x201D; The pugilists seem to agree unanimously that this was not a very nice thing to do. You laugh, stepping closer to them. &#x201C;If you are not going to leave here without a fight, I will kindly oblige you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We did not come here to fight, we came to uphold justice!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose our interpretations of justice do not coincide,&#x201D; you say disinterestedly. &#x201C;No matter. I have my own path, and you have yours. Right now that means if you want to get to the pirates, you must first get past me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are truly just like your master,&#x201D; grimaces Zhou. &#x201C;I am disappointed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Better hope that is the only way I am like my master then, old man,&#x201D; you grin, crouching low into a Shouwang stance. &#x201C;Otherwise, the sea will run red with blood before I am done tonight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A burly pugilist steps in front of you, appearing to be confident in his strength. &#x201C;I will be the first and only one to meet your challenge. My name is Mo Mindian, of &#x2013;&#x201C; You cut his introduction short with a swift blow to his belly, felling him in a single blow. Blood trickles from his lips and his eyes have rolled up in his head, though the man still breathes. Drawing a deep breath, you shout your challenge cheerfully above the roar of the waves: &#x201C;Enough words! There are one hundred and twenty two&#x2026; twenty one of you, and if I am to listen to your long winded introductions it will be dawn before I have finished with you. Now, come at me!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There is a brief moment of hesitation, but their fear is soon wiped away by anger &#x2013; no matter their level of competence, they <i>are </i>still warriors. The first two to reach you fight unarmed. You have no idea of the school they belong to, nor do you care. They will serve for a quick warm-up. The two fighters approach from both sides, starting it off with a punch. Swaying away from their outstretched fists, you grip them at the elbow, your fingers digging into flesh. With a wet, ripping sound, you drag your fingers down their forearms, tearing away at their tendons. Your opponents collapse, screaming and clutching at their crippled arms, as you take another step closer towards the crowd.<br>
<br>
More of them leap into action.<br>
<br>
Evading their attacks, you roll away and dart between the enemy fighters with your <i>qinggong</i>, moving lightly across the sandy terrain. A few unskilled hands try to grab you, but you elude their grasp with ease, slipping away with deceptive movements. You lay into them with fist and claw, summoning your inner strength to augment your might. Every blow of yours cracks bone and rends flesh. The droplets of blood that spatter the sand are dark under the pale moonlight.<br>
<br>
You feel two strong arms hook under your shoulders and lift you up from behind. Your feet leave the ground. Before you can struggle free, a series of powerful kicks land right in your torso. Gritting your teeth against the pain, you swing your legs upwards. Your feet catch the jaw of the fighter in front of you, dislocating it and toppling him. With tremendous effort, you break your captor&#x2019;s grip, flipping around behind him and sending him to the ground with a knee to the back of his head. There is no time to rest, as more pugilists beset you from all sides. Whirling around, you dodge what you can and block what you cannot, striking out at your opponents when you see the opportunity.<br>
<br>
A spear takes you in the side, but you snap off the shaft before it penetrates further and reward your assailant with a blow to the side of his temple &#x2013; he is out like a light before he even hits the ground. Before long, you find yourself trapped: six swords surround you, all aimed for your neck. <i>Songfeng</i>. You crouch to the ground and and throw yourself against one of the swordsmen. You barrel into his knees, knocking him to the ground. Rolling to your feet, you recover before he can and put him down with a swift punch to the chest. Blood sprays from his mouth; you have no idea what you hit to make that happen, but it probably isn&#x2019;t good for him.<br>
<br>
With one fluid movement, you rise while plucking his sword from his motionless fingers, parrying the Songfeng blades. You know that their sword technique consists of fluid, continuous movements that pressure the opponent ceaselessly &#x2013; with a quick flick of your wrist, you press the attack, swinging your blade without giving them time to transition into their next move. A swift stab to the thigh brings down one disciple while the remaining four are still twirling into position. He falls on his behind, the sword still sunk into his leg. Grabbing the sword arm of the closest one, you twist it. There is a loud crack as his forearm bends unnaturally; the sword drops from his limp hand and you catch it before it hits the ground. Sweeping upwards with that same sword, you slice into the arm of another Songfeng disciple, leaving a deep cut just under his shoulder.<br>
<br>
You wince; you had attacked on your injured side, and that movement caused your spear injury to worsen. They do not hesitate to capitalize on your moment of weakness. A swift stab is sent flying towards your heart, but you manage to move away just in time for it to only strike your upper arm, the blade&#x2019;s point lodging in bone. Pivoting on your feet, you swing around and grasp the hand that wielded that sword, crushing it in your grip. Your opponent screams.<br>
<br>
More fighters surge to the aid of the Songfeng disciples, attempting to overwhelm you with sheer force. You cannot think of anything else but fighting right now. Punches. Kicks. Slashes and stabs. Some of them hit you, some do not. You hit back. Things become a blur as you allow your instinct to take over, focusing only on surviving the battle.<br>
<br>
You hurl someone over your shoulder. As he lands on the backs of his fallen comrades, you end it by driving your fist into his stomach. You spit out the blood that has welled up in your mouth, wiping your lips on your arm. Your knuckles are bleeding and swollen, and a gash of your head has been dripping blood into your right eye for the last dozen minutes. Your vision is blurry, your breath disordered. Your chest feels like it is on fire. You have no idea how many cuts and scrapes you have suffered, and how many times you have nearly avoided dying, but it looks like there is now a lull in the storm.<br>
<br>
Chuckling, you turn your gaze towards the remaining fighters. &#x201C;Ha&#x2026;&#x201D; you pant heavily, rising up to your full height, &#x201C;&#x2026;are you taking a break? I suppose&#x2026; you need a rest&#x2026; don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Whimpering men litter the beach, their groans growing louder as the stinging seawater rolls over their bodies with the rising of the tide.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So&#x2026; who&#x2019;s next?&#x201D; You raise a finger, pointing at the remaining pugilists in a challenging manner; none of the masters have joined the fray, instead opting to watch with ever increasing horror as you dismantled their strike force on your own. It looks like there are less than thirty of them left. To your surprise, your arm seems to have turned a strange shade of purple &#x2013; you had not noticed it during the fight. You peer at it more closely. It might be broken.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Looks like it&#x2019;s broken!&#x201D; calls out Xiahou Yu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s not. It just turns this colour when I get serious!&#x201D; you shout back. &#x201C;Now, do we continue the fun, or do the games end here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zhou Dingqiu, Master Ji, and Master Gong step forward; the latter two rather nervously. &#x201C;Why are you going to such lengths for a band of pirates?&#x201D; asks Zhou, perplexed. &#x201C;Is it the treasure they promised? I do not understand, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then I&apos;ll hit you until you do.&quot; Cracking your neck to work out the kinks, you beckon with your fingers, urging him to continue the fight.<br>
<br>
The masters are more of a challenge than their disciples. Despite their age they are faster and stronger than their students, and in your current condition you are hard pressed to defend yourself against all three. Their relentless blows drive you back &#x2013; Zhou&#x2019;s sword, Ji&#x2019;s palms and Gong&#x2019;s fists show no mercy, pummeling you from all sides. Your defense fails. Your knees buckle under the force of their assault. Master Gong blindsides you from the right, driving both his fists into your ribcage. You are flung away a good distance, tumbling across the wet sand before skidding to a halt. Righting yourself, you regain your stance. The surf laps at your feet as the three masters approach.<br>
<br>
Master Ji leaps at you, his palm outstretched. Summoning your strength in the stance of the Xianglong Palms, you meet his attack, palm-to-palm. It is a clash of internal energy &#x2013; Ji is stunned when your <i>neigong </i>proves sufficient to rise to his challenge. He is pushed back across the beach, his palm still glued to yours as the struggle continues both externally and internally. Master Gong runs to his aid;  planting both his hands on Master Ji&#x2019;s back, he channels his <i>qi </i>into his ally. Your advance slows; the both of them dig in their heels, beginning to form some semblance of resistance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2026; what is this feeling?&#x201D; gasps Master Ji as his arm trembles. If he knows one thing, it is that if he wavers for even a second you will overpower him and strike a deciding blow, such is the strange and dangerous nature of your <i>qi</i>. You force your legs to take an step towards them. Then another. And another. Their feet slip, backpedalling into a retreat. Drawing upon reserves you never knew you had, you push forth in an inexorable advance, allowing your primordial energy to surge forward without restraint.<br>
<br>
Then, Master Zhou arrives to their aid. Squaring his stance and steadying his footing, he slams his palms into Master Gong&#x2019;s back with a shout, lending his energy to theirs. Their combined strength is sufficient to finally force you back. Your arm shivers as they attempt to break your guard &#x2013; it feels as if your arm is about to snap like a twig under pressure. You grip your wrist with your other hand, gasping at the effort and the pain it causes you. There is no other choice.<br>
<br>
You forcibly bring your rampaging <i>qi </i>under control, constraining it. Compacting it.<br>
<br>
As expected, it reacts in as volatile a manner as it had during the tournament finals. Perhaps more. There is a loud bang, the sound of air being forced outwards sharply. The force of the internal energy channeled through your palm explodes, as you lose all control over it. An invisible pressure hurls the three masters away from you. Sand and surf flies up into the air.<br>
<br>
Your legs give way. Sinking to your knees, you try to gulp for air. Every breath you take seems to burn your lungs. You look at your opponents. Master Ji seems to have taken the brunt of your attack &#x2013; he is face down, unmoving on the ground. Master Gong is hunched over in pain, while Zhou Dingqiu gets to his feet unsteadily, his breathing heavy. You force yourself back up, grinning. Every nerve and muscle and bone in your body protests in excruciating pain, almost sending you back down, but you persist.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026; that was&#x2026; exciting,&#x201D; you say, haltingly. &#x201C;How many of you&#x2026; left?&#x201D; You do a quick count with your eyes, wiping away the blood that is smearing your vision. &#x201C;Including you, Master Zhou&#x2026; twenty two, it seems. Not a big number.&#x201D; You exhale, balling your hands into fists and raising them. &#x201C;Do you want to give it another try? Perhaps this time you&#x2019;ll get lucky.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zhou Dingqiu scowls, raising his sword again. &#x201C;Your head is made of stone. I do not think even the gods themselves can beat any sense into you, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; Unexpectedly, his son places himself between the two of you. &#x201C;I think this is getting pointless, father. Just look around you!&#x201D; The beach is filled with groaning and moving bodies, some half-dead, some unconscious. It is not certain whether any of them are dead, but in the chaos of the melee that is always a possibility. Zhideng continues, &#x201C;It is our loss. We cannot take on the pirates with just twenty two men. Besides, our fellow pugilists will need care and aid. We cannot leave them here like this. Any further fighting will not  serve our cause.&#x201D; With a disgruntled look, the elder Zhou sheathes his sword, nodding in agreement. &#x201C;Very well, my son. I suppose you are correct.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are still fresh, Young Master Zhou,&#x201D; you chuckle, swaying on your feet even so. &#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you going to test yourself?&#x201D; He gives you a sad smile and shakes his head. &#x201C;As I have said before, I watched your fights in the tournament. I know when I am outclassed. It is your victory.&#x201D; You aren&#x2019;t so sure. A light breeze would knock you down right now, and it must be utterly obvious that you are in no more condition to fight while they still have twenty fresh fighters to throw at you. You grin wearily. &#x201C;If you insist that I have won, then I suppose I have.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We have medicines,&#x201D; says Yorimitsu carefully, as he steps back to the fore. He keeps his gaze trained on the Zhou father and son, giving them a slight bow. &#x201C;If you promise to retreat immediately afterwards, and never step foot on this island again, I can have my healers tend to your wounded.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The younger Zhou seems to be considering his proposal, but Zhou Dingqiu immediately shakes his head. &#x201C;No. I thank you for your offer, pirate, but firstly, I do not trust you, and secondly, it would shame me even more to receive aid from an enemy. We will take care of our own. We do not need the Wo to spare us any charity.&#x201D; Casting a withering glance at you, he turns and begins ordering the remaining fighters to start helping the fallen pugilists.<br>
<br>
You laugh loudly before falling flat on your face, your limbs finally deciding that they have had enough of this abuse and that a vacation is in order.<br>
<br>
Xiahou Yu and Zhou Zixia run to your side, turning you over.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think I might need some of those healers he talked about,&#x201D; you groan, tasting the sand in your mouth.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Minamoto clan is eternally in your debt, Xu Jing.&#x201D; Yorimitsu and his uncle bow to you on their knees, demonstrating their utmost respect. You had successfully chased away more than a hundred pugilists by yourself, sparing hundreds of lives from a terrible battle. In the aftermath, Zixia had returned with her family, promising that she would find a way to convey a reward to you for your help in the near future. She had managed to convince her friend to leave - Yorimitsu had allowed her husband to depart the clan, and hopefully the two of them will find a place to belong.<br>
<br>
You cough, pulling yourself upright amidst the swaddle of bandages you find yourself tightly bound in. Your body is a sack full of pain at the moment, but you can still manage to move about, albeit slowly. &#x201C;Does that mean you will listen to whatever I say?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My honour demands that you can have my life if you should require it,&#x201D; says Yorimitsu seriously. &#x201C;You went above and beyond for the likes of us even when you had no obligation to do so. I would entrust my life to you without hesitation.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If that is the case&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You should solve the issue of their piracy, but what are the measures you can take?<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You ask them to stay on the island but refrain from any further piracy from the time being. They should have stockpiled enough supplies to last for a brief while &#x2013; you will arrange for aid when you return to the mainland. Hopefully the pugilists will not have sufficient strength to retaliate&#x2026; and you hope that the Court doesn&#x2019;t take notice and respond by bringing in the navy.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Yinhu Island is but a couple weeks&#x2019; sail away from here. It is a much larger island, and from experience you know that there are some patches of fertile soil around &#x2013; it should be a suitable place for them to settle on, and they will likely be safe from any reprisals if they hide there. You give them directions to Maniac Island, and a letter to show to Zhang.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You ask them for all of their treasure &#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t amount to much, but you will use it to negotiate with Yuhua Hall. Being an influential establishment, they might be able to conjure up some aid, especially for the women and children. You are unsure if this is the best choice in the long term, but it is probably the safest way to get help to them, if it succeeds.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You go straight to the governor, trying to convince him with a mixture of blandishments and threats, as well as bribery with the pirates&#x2019; treasure. A single word from him would make the Minamoto clan&#x2019;s lives much easier, and it is the quickest way to help them. Every man has his price, and he may be more amenable to reason after the defeat of the pugilists.<br>
<br>
<b>3. </b>You attempt to get into contact with the Crown Prince. You know for a fact that he does not spend all of his time in Chang&#x2019;an; the time of the year seems right for him to embark on one of the Imperial Southern Inspections. You have little chance of crossing paths with him, but you could bribe a beggar to convey a message in your mutual code &#x2013; Shun is smart enough to handle the rest on his own. He will be keen on recruiting the Minamoto, but you are also certain that he will not want any other organizations getting a whiff of this; that means that you will not be able to seek help for the Minamoto from any other group.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The pirates do not have much treasure they can offer; their money would be better spent on attempting to establish relations for their long-term prospects. To that end, they have decided to present to you a gift of a beautifully forged wodao &#x2013; a slim and slender sabre similar to the ones in use by the Tang, but with a gentle curve to its back. You find that the balance of the masterwork blade is impeccable for both stabbing and slashing; it is balanced enough that you could handle it as if it were a regular sword. You cannot conceal it as with the Yuchang Sword, but if you have no use for it and times are hard, you could likely pawn it for some money.<br>
<br>
Besides that, Yoriwaka, the stealth master of the clan, has offered to impart to you one of the techniques that he has mastered in his travels over the years.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Reikan. (&#x970A;&#x52D8;, Spiritual Instinct) A technique that involves the use of <i>qi </i>in such a way that it augments the five senses of the practitioner. It is analogous to multiple similar techniques known by martial arts practitioners in the Central Plains. It requires a calm inner state to be used effectively, with the greatest effects being seen during meditation. (+2 Perception)<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Kagemi. (&#x5F71;&#x8EAB;, Shadow Body). A method of silent moving that melds well with your Kuanglang Step &#x2013; Kuanglang Step will increase to a higher level, allowing you to be undetectable to all but an elite few. (Additional +2 Stealth to Kuanglang Step).<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Your convalescence means that you will be unable to practice any martial arts for a while, at least until you can exert yourself again without vomiting blood all over the place. You decide to spend your time practicing other skills with Xiahou Yu. Of course, drinking is out.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You play with dice with him, using your cunning to figure out how to cheat at it. (+2 Sleight-of-Hand)<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You practice art, getting pointers and tips on how to best hold a brush, and the most interesting way of cobbling together couplets. (+2 Artistic Skill)<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You study history and the classics, absorbing knowledge from the learned scholar. (+2 Scholarly Knowledge)<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>The both of you have little knowledge of traps, but you work together to think up various theoretical ways to set up traps. (+2 Traps)

            <h3>三十五 · Meeting at a Shrine</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Meeting at a Shrine</span></b><br>
<br>
The pigeon flies off, leaving the letter behind in your hand. You think you should learn how to train one of those from Master Zhang when you have the chance. Unfurling the letter, you take care not to touch the suspicious-looking stains. It looks like the pigeon has relieved itself repeatedly in a rather awkward fashion during its flight here. The letter is simple and to the point:<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My apprentice, the plight of these people that you have sent me is rather interesting, as are their skills. I will have set sail for Nippon by the time you read this letter, bringing along some of the Minamoto as my guides. I will check on your progress after I have completed my tour of their country.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Crumpling up the paper, you toss it into the meagre fire you have going. As expected of your master; hopefully he won&#x2019;t become a diplomatic incident. The sky has turned dark some time ago. There is a rumble of thunder. Looking up, you glimpse a brief flash of lightning through the holes in the ramshackle roof. With a sigh, Xiahou Yu finishes his records and begins packs up his writing utensils.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I still do not see why you feel the need to write down every happening that has occurred each day,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;It is not like we are doing anything important that needs to be immortalized in literature. We aren&#x2019;t exactly Xuanzang on his journey to the west.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Habit,&#x201D; replies Yu. &#x201C;Besides, you never know when it might come in handy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You snort. &#x201C;I am not so old that I need to write down everything I have experienced.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, there will come a day when we are old men. I will gladly share my journals with you then.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh, but a thunderous bang drowns out your intended reply. The rain begins to fall hard, spattering noisily against the rooftop. The roof of the old shrine keeps out most of the rain, just barely, but enough water begins to leak in to make the place uncomfortably wet. Xiahou Yu hurriedly puts away his tools before they get wet. You are about two days away from Xiangyang &#x2013; there you should be able to find better shelter. For now, you have to make do with what you find on the road.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t there supposed to be a village near here?&#x201D; wonders Yu aloud, looking at his map.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Beats me,&#x201D; you shrug. &#x201C;At any rate, we couldn&#x2019;t have progressed any further for today... wait.&#x201D; You gesture at the scholar to stay still. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s someone coming,&#x201D; you say. He looks puzzled. &#x201C;Is there?&#x201D; You can faintly hear footsteps splashing through the mud and rain &#x2013; there seems to be only one person. Even in your weakened state you should still be able to take a single bandit, but if luck did not go your way it could be some martial arts master after your head. You did not leave Yangzhou on good terms with the orthodox schools there after all &#x2013; it would be no surprise if they sent someone after you. Your hand drifts to the wodao at your side, ready to draw it if necessary.<br>
<br>
The doors to the shrine are thrown open. You see a stocky man standing in the pouring rain. A flash of lightning throws his features under an ominous silhouette &#x2013; his beard is wild and unruly, and his eyes bulge out like that of a fish. His thick lips part and widen into a sneer. &#x201C;Ah, fellow travellers,&#x201D; says the newcomer in a polite fashion unbefitting his looks. His voice is deep and gravelly. &#x201C;I wonder if you would let me stay a while until the storm has passed.&#x201D; You nod cautiously &#x2013; though there is a sword by his side, he is dressed in the robes and accessories of an itinerant Taoist priest. He does not seem like a pugilist of the <i>jianghu</i>.<br>
<br>
The man&#x2019;s ugly grin grows bigger as he steps over the threshold, closing the doors behind him. His strange, large eyes roll over the view in front of him, finally resting upon your sword-hand. &#x201C;I suppose these are dangerous times, but I assure you that you have nothing to fear from me.&#x201D; You nod again, releasing your grip on your sword. Then, you put on a smile. &#x201C;That is very reassuring indeed. Come, make yourself comfortable by the fire. It is not much, but every little bit helps when we are far from home.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Taoist does so, grinning all the way. He opens up his backpack and pulls out a large gourd of wine, taking a long swig from it. With a grunt, the man holds out the gourd and shakes it, offering it to the two of you. Xiahou Yu shakes his head quickly and retreats with a nervous smile, nibbling his thumb. &#x201C;You must pardon my friend,&#x201D; you explain, &#x201C;he has had some bad encounters with alcohol. I will gladly drink with you.&#x201D; You sip the wine politely, not wanting to imbibe too much. As you return the gourd to the Taoist, he nods approvingly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, Master priest, what brings you all the way out here?&#x201D; You had chosen a rather remote route to Xiangyang; you were certainly off the beaten track. It was a quick route, all things considered, but the terrain was more difficult to traverse.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Matters of the Tao, of course,&#x201D; smiles your guest. &#x201C;My name is Zhong Hai, exorcist of spirits and demons, hailing from a long line of esteemed ghost-catchers. I have been called to investigate some incidents of meddlesome ghosts in a nearby village. Who might you two young gentlemen be?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, pardon our manners,&#x201D; you reply, bowing. &#x201C;I am Xu Jing and this is Xiahou Yu. We are two travelling scholars on our way to Xiangyang-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ghosts?&#x201D; interrupts Xiahou Yu. &#x201C;Did you say ghosts?&#x201D; He is trembling, but not out of fear &#x2013; out of excitement. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know that you liked supernatural occurrences,&#x201D; you quip, &#x201C;with all your focus on arts and books.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I have <i>always </i>wanted to meet one! The first stories I learnt to read were a collection of ghostly tales. Sadly the real thing seems to be far rarer than people claim they are; I have never seen one. Master Zhong, you must have a lot of experiences subduing these spirits, right?&#x201D; says Yu excitedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That I have. I have wandered the land for over thirty years in my line of work,&#x201D;replies the exorcist. &#x201C;Why, lad, do you wish to see one?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is one of my life&#x2019;s goals,&#x201D; replies the scholar proudly. Zhong Hai smiles thinly. &#x201C;I would advise against it &#x2013; the living and the dead are best kept apart&#x2026; but I will not lie; it can also be one of the most strange and enchanting sights for mortal eyes. If you are that eager I would not mind some company on my next job.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How about it, Jing?&#x201D; grins Xiahou Yu as he turns to you. &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t we check this out? Don&#x2019;t tell me you aren&#x2019;t interested in supernatural incidents?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You go along with Xiahou Yu and Zhong Hai to investigate this allegedly haunted village. You believe in the existence of spirits and deities, like every other person in the world, but you have never seen one yourself. It should be an enlightening and educational experience, no matter what happens.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You prefer to forge ahead to Xiangyang. You allow Xiahou Yu to go off with Zhong Hai if that is what he wants &#x2013; you have no interest in bossing him around &#x2013; you can always meet up with him back at the city after he has had his little adventure. On your part, you have no interest in hunting for ghosts and demons.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You remind Xiahou Yu that he has a debt to you, forbidding him from going off with the priest. None of you are going to go gallivanting about after ethereal entities &#x2013; you have real things to investigate in Xiangyang, and this will likely only become a waste of time.

            <h3>三十六 · Night at the Mansion</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Night at the Mansion</span></b><br>
<br>
A plain, gloomy ceiling makes itself the first thing your eyes see when they open. Your mind feels fuzzy, as if a dozen drunken martial artists had danced upon it with their tramping feet. It looks like you are in someone&#x2019;s bedroom. A single candle is the only thing that shines in this place. There are windows, but it appears to be dark outside. The air is deathly still; there is no breeze to speak of, nor are there any insects singing their nocturnal song. Suddenly, a great flash of light illuminates the entire room. The thunder arrives just a beat behind, loud enough to rattle the wooden frames of the windows. Then, the silence of the night is abruptly disturbed by a torrent of rain, pouring down from the heavens without end as if Yu Shi desired to flood the world.<br>
<br>
How did you get here? Your memories are still faint, but you vaguely recall meeting the Taoist Zhong Hai while sheltering from another thunderstorm with Xiahou Yu. The both of you had opted to follow him on an exorcism. After that, you had reached a village &#x2013; you do not recall how long it took you to get there &#x2013; where the elder had provided Zhong Hai with more details about his mission. It seems that ghosts had been kidnapping their young men, swooping down in the middle of the night and spiriting them away. The elder claimed that these men had been taken to an abandoned mansion up in the hills. You remember little after that, only that you had reached the mansion without any obstacles. There had been something off about the courtyard as you marched towards the entrance&#x2026; horses? You recall seeing four horses, and wondering why there would be any. Then, you had stepped across the threshold of the main doors.<br>
<br>
The next thing you knew, you were in this room.<br>
<br>
You sit up on the admittedly comfortable bed and close your eyes. As you focus, the sound of the raindrops become sharper, each patter a distinct note to your ears. You breathe in, sensing the humid air and the slight breeze that has sprung up. The room is very dusty, rewarding you with an irritated nose. You sneeze. The temperature is cold &#x2013; any colder and your breath would create puffs. You do not, however, hear any living thing.<br>
<br>
Opening your eyes again, you get up from the bed. There is no other furniture here besides the bed and the table upon which the candle is set. From the dust, it does not seem like anyone has been in here for quite some time. You check your possessions; the talismans that Zhong Hai gave you are still there, folded up safely in your clothes. Plucking the candle from the table, you hold it out in front of you to light your way. You fumble for the door, pushing at it. It is locked, barred from within. You look around you again &#x2013; there is no place for anyone to hide, not even under the small bed. The windows too are barred from the inside. How strange. It would be spooky, if not for the fact that Master Zhang once told you of a master assassin who could contort himself through the smallest spaces. Sadly, he found himself in a box one day, having been tricked by his mark, and ended up in several boxes soon after. This is not anything you would need to resort to ghosts to explain&#x2026; you think.<br>
<br>
Shrugging, you unbar the door and let yourself out.<br>
<br>
The corridor outside is dimly lit, with little white lanterns lining the walls at far intervals. Here and there long strips of tattered cloth sway gently, hanging down from the ceiling to about the top of your head. They must have been decorations once, but they are too moth-eaten now for you to be sure. Some of the cloth strips are stained with rusty brown spatters, others tied into loops that you could probably fit a head through. A dyeing process gone wrong? The artistic tastes of the mansion&#x2019;s inhabitants? You will never know, you suppose.<br>
<br>
Looking to your left and right, the corridor seems to recede into infinite darkness. There seems to be no difference as to which way you pick. You decide to just step forward on a whim, your candle jutting out in front of you. The floorboards creak as you walk, almost in rhythm to the pouring rain and rumbling thunder. Here and there you try to see through the windows, but between the storm and the darkness you cannot make out a single thing outside of the mansion.<br>
<br>
A slight chill runs through you for no reason, and you stop.<br>
<br>
There appears to be a faint melody in the air &#x2013; someone is humming a tune. There appears to be a door to your left that you have not noticed before. The lanterns in front of you seem to have gone dark &#x2013; for some reason you do not quite understand, you feel goosebumps whenever you stare into the black void ahead. You turn around &#x2013; it looks like the path you came from has also been swallowed up by darkness. Perhaps the lanterns have been blown out by a sudden gust of wind? Turning your attention to the room, you see that it is well-lit; you can see the glow of light through the windows. The pleasant voice is coming from somewhere within. It seems to be that of a girl, and the tune is strangely familiar to you; though you do not remember where you have heard it before, it must have been before you left the palace.<br>
<br>
You hear the sound of water splashing unlike that of the rain outside. Whoever is inside is probably bathing&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You peek. You cannot call yourself a man if you don&#x2019;t. Besides, there are very legitimate reasons for this, such as&#x2026; reconnaissance. Yes, that is it. You need to find out who else is here besides you, Xiahou Yu and Zhong Hai. There were horses in the courtyard. There must be some living people here &#x2013; why would ghosts need horses? If you do not look, you will not find out. Ergo, you <i>must</i> p&#x2026; reconnoitre.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do not peek. You are a gentleman. Such actions are very impolite. <i>Of course </i>you aren&#x2019;t scared of possibly attracting the attention whatever is bathing within, it is just the rudeness of poking a hole through the paper and peering inside that you are against. Nothing to do with fear of the supernatural at all&#x2026; nothing at all. In fact, to prove your gentlemanly guts, you will knock on the door and attempt to engage the bather in conversation. Politely.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You ignore the bather, opting to tread forward into the darkness alone despite the faint warning of your instincts.

            <h3>三十七 · The Maiden in the Mansion</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Maiden in the Mansion</span></b><br>
<br>
Bandits and rival pugilists were one thing, but could you defeat a ghost with your fists? You are unsure&#x2026; but <i>surely </i>you have more guts than this? Drawing a deep breath and suppressing your trepidation, you summon all of your courage and knock on the door. The sound of splashing water stops. A voice calls out sharply: &#x201C;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201D; You are unsure how to answer. It sounds like a rather familiar voice, one you have heard recently. It also sounds nothing like how you think a ghost would sound, being full of warmth and life and very hostile suspicion.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I beg my pardons for intruding on your bath, but-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do not recall seeing any male attendants when I arrived. Who are you?&#x201D; the voice repeats, more menacingly this time. Water splashes onto the floor of the room as the person inside gets up from their bath in a hurry. You can hear the ruffling of clothes. Well, it is only good manners to allow her to get dressed, you supposed. While waiting, you continue to explain yourself.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am but a humble traveller, lost in this storm. Could I-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think so!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The door bursts open suddenly. There is a loud crack &#x2013; the tail end of a whip wraps itself around your wrist. You would never have been caught this easily were you prepared, or had you been in top condition, but right now&#x2026; With a sudden jerk you are brought down, falling painfully against the wooden floor. A foot lands on your neck before you can move an inch.<br>
<br>
The girl calls out in an imperious voice. &#x201C;You are an orthodox pugilist sent to pursue me, aren&#x2019;t you? You&#x2026; wait, you? From the tournament?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You finally recognize that voice. Nameless. The Holy Maiden of the Fire Cult.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hello, princess,&#x201D; you say, twisting around and trying to get a glimpse of her. Her foot presses down even harder on your neck, telling you that it is a bad idea. You give up for now and slump loosely on the floor like a downtrodden worm. &#x201C;Fancy meeting you here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t give me that, Man Tiger Pig. What are you doing here? Did you come to peek, like the lecherous, perverted pig that you are?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I swear, the thought <i>never </i>crossed my mind,&#x201D; you say quickly. &#x201C;I am a gentleman of the highest order.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, of <i>course </i>I believe you,&#x201D; laughs the Holy Maiden sarcastically as she grinds her heel on the back of your neck. &#x201C;Answer my question. Why <i>are </i>you here? I did not think you were working with the orthodox sects.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was just coincidence, that&#x2019;s all,&#x201D; you reply. &#x201C;I had no idea you were here. I would have steered far away from this place if I knew. Your company is entirely unpleasant to me. Now, let me up or I&#x2019;ll have to get serious. I&#x2019;m not here to fight with you.&#x201D; She is a tough opponent for you even at your best, but if she found out that you had been severely injured, any negotiations from now on would be severely lopsided in her favour. Besides, you aren&#x2019;t lying: you <i>would </i>have to get serious. A quick grab at her sensitive spots should do it, though you might get an arm broken for your efforts. You feel the pressure on your neck lessen as she lifts her foot. Massaging your sore neck, you sit up, groaning all the while.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think that was a bit uncalled for,&#x201D; you say, looking up at the beautiful girl standing warily in front of you. She shrugs. &#x201C;You just have that sort of lecherous look that deserves a beating. Now, can you tell me <i>why </i>you are here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will, but I want to know why <i>you </i>are here after I finish,&#x201D; you say. She nods once, keeping her eyes pinned on your hands even as she does so. It looks like she still doesn&#x2019;t trust you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m here ghost-hunting.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Her face pales visibly, but she keeps her self-assured tone. &#x201C;Ha ha. A good joke, Man Tiger Pig. What do you mean, ghost-hunting? There aren&#x2019;t any ghosts here. I was received by the lady of the mansion just yesterday, and treated kindly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you blind? Look around you.&#x201D; You gesture at the ominous strips of cloth, at the darkened hallways, and at the dusty floor. &#x201C;No matter how you look at it, it&#x2019;s clearly not normal.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well,&#x201D; she replies, a nervous tone creeping into her voice. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t see anything out of the usual. Everything is norm&#x2026; is&#x2026; is&#x2026;&#x201D; Her eyes widen, as if seeing the place revealed in truth for the first time. &#x201C;What is&#x2026;&#x201D; She is frozen, stock still for a moment. The lights in the room behind her flicker. For a brief instance you see two rooms overlaid upon each other &#x2013; one bright and cosy, the other dark and creepy.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Here&#x2019;s my chance!&#x201D; You whip out a talisman from your clothes and plant it right on the middle of her forehead, keeping it pressed there with your fingers. &#x201C;Begone, evil spirit!&#x201D; She stares back at you, having regained her composure. &#x201C;What do you think you are doing?&#x201D; she asks sweetly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Uh&#x2026; exorcising a ghost?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m not a ghost!&#x201D; she yells, striking out at you. You barely evade her attack in time, leaping back. The talisman flutters to the floor between the both of you. Either it is a useless fake, or she is not a ghost at all. You are not sure which is the correct answer. Suddenly, the flickering lights are blown out, leaving your candle as the only source of light in the darkened hallway. The Holy Maiden gives a short, girlish shriek, rooted to the spot. You hear a light, haunting laughter of a woman surrounding you, murmured words that you cannot make out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Talismans!&#x201D; shouts the girl. &#x201C;You have them, right? Use your talismans!&#x201D; You draw out another talisman, waving it around in the air helplessly. How <i>were </i>you supposed to use one of these things? Suddenly, the talisman catches fire. You drop it before the flames reach your fingers. As it burns to ashes on the floor, the darkness seems to retreat. The lanterns come back to life with their steady glow, though the gloomy, dusty demeanour of your surroundings remain. You suppose those talismans <i>do </i>work after all.<br>
<br>
The girl breathes heavily, having sunken to her knees in fright. &#x201C;What, is the Holy Maiden scared of ghosts?&#x201D; you say, though your heart is gripped by a small chill too. &#x201C;Shouldn&#x2019;t you have some sort of holy light to chase away spirits?&#x201D; She stares at you angrily, but you wonder if she <i>didn&#x2019;t </i>have some sort of innate protection &#x2013; after all, things only started getting really strange after you mentioned ghosts to her, shaking her composure. Well, what&#x2019;s done is done.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, you still haven&#x2019;t told me why you are here,&#x201D; you say cheerily, peering into the room she was bathing in; there is still a rusted tub inside, but the water is brackish. You probably shouldn&#x2019;t tell her to look at the room again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The machinations of the so-called upstanding orthodox sects,&#x201D; she says with a look of disgust. &#x201C;Vahista insisted on stopping a while at Wufushan for you, thinking that there was a chance you might come. I have no idea why he would invite such a lout, but it turned out badly. More than a hundred orthodox swordsmen attacked us there, separating us. My handmaidens then acted as a decoy so that I could escape alone, while they led the enemy on a merry chase.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alone? You mean you came here alone?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. I was caught in a sudden storm and needed shelter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You vaguely recall seeing four horses out in the courtyard; it was likely that one of it was hers, but who did the other three horses belong to? You are certain they were not the Taoist&#x2019;s.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Anyway,&#x201D; you sigh, moving forward. &#x201C;What do you know about this mansion? You said that a lady invited you in.&#x201D; She follows you, a reluctant look on her face. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Lady Mi, who is living here with her maids. That is why I said I did not see any men around. You were acting suspiciously from the start &#x2013; no, you have <i>always </i>been a suspicious fellow, so it was only natural that my keen senses picked up on your perverted desires.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not, not at all. You are just a paranoid girl. Did you inhale too much smoke from worshipping that fire of yours?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You dance away from the crack of her whip, keeping your candle steady. &#x201C;Watch it!&#x201D; you shout. &#x201C;I wonder just <i>who </i>taught you to be so rude,&#x201D; she says, an angry grin on her face. &#x201C;You aren&#x2019;t any less rude yourself,&#x201D; you retort.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Only to lowly, insolent dogs like you, who don&#x2019;t deserve mercy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, yes, lowly insolent dogs like me who so happen to have the talismans that can chase away <i>ghosts</i>.&#x201D; You flash a talisman at her, grinning as you step out of range of her whip. A look of fear passes over her face as she hurries to catch up to you. &#x201C;R-right,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;I suppose I can tolerate your presence for now. Not because of ghosts or anything like that, but because you would be too scared to proceed without my companionship. I will do you a favour, Man Tiger Pig.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course you will,&#x201D; you sneer, glad at having gotten one over her this time. You should probably lord it over this arrogant girl while you can. &#x201C;By the way, you have been here longer than I have, with those <i>ghosts</i>,&#x201D; you say, enjoying the look of discomfort on her face. &#x201C;Can you tell where we are?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She looks around her. &#x201C;This place seems a bit bigger than I remember, but the layout appears to not have changed too much. I suppose we are in the west wing. If that is the case&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
There are a few interesting rooms that you can reach quickly from here. You decide to visit:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>The library chambers. There might be some things of interest that you can find in the library. Perhaps the scholar will be there, too.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>The kitchen. You are feeling rather hungry. Sure, you might not be able to find any food here, but no harm looking. Besides, you have heard before that a kitchen is the least haunted of any place&#x2026; you think.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>The main foyer. You are heading straight for the main exit. Best to make sure you can escape first. It is too bad about Xiahou Yu and Zhong Hai, but you can come back for them after looking around outside.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;All right, that&#x2019;s decided then,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s head there.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The two of you walk slowly and quietly along the hallways. The storm is still going strong outside, with frequent flashes of lightning illuminating your path harshly. The candle has melted down to about half of its original length &#x2013; it probably will not last another hour, but at least the corridors are lit dimly by the lanterns. Suddenly, the girl behind you speaks up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Say&#x2026; what is your name?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, that is rather sudden,&#x201D; you say, not looking back. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you just call me by Man Tiger Pig? Why do you need to know my name?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was just wondering,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;since there was this&#x2026; boy that I once knew. You remind me of him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh? A childhood sweetheart?&#x201D; you laugh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not,&#x201D; she snaps. &#x201C;He was just as vile and crude as you are. I swore that if I ever saw him again I would cut him into eighteen pieces and feed him to the wolves.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, that gives me no incentive to admit that I was the boy even if I actually <i>were</i> him. What are you, stupid?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You prepare to duck a blow from the violent girl, but she doesn&#x2019;t respond to your taunt.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You give her your name.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&#x2019;t give her your name.

            <h3>三十八 · Man in Black in the Library</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Man in Black in the Library</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing&#x2026; You wouldn&#x2019;t be&#x2026; No, it doesn&#x2019;t matter now, does it?&#x201D; She shakes her head, a slightly melancholic look on her face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are rather strange, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; you ask with a laugh. &#x201C;First you ask my name, then you say it doesn&#x2019;t matter? Make up your mind.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I didn&#x2019;t mean that-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You interrupt her. &#x201C;So, now that you know my name, am I expected to keep calling you Holy Maiden in return?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;very well,&#x201D; she replies reluctantly. &#x201C;Yunzi&#x2026; that name should do, for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yunzi, huh? I have no problems calling you that &#x2013; it&#x2019;s less of a sting to my pride than praising the oh-so-Holy Maiden at any rate. It is my unfortunate pleasure to meet you, Miss Yunzi. Shall we be off?&#x201D; You give her a mocking bow, eliciting a rather nasty glare from the girl. You wonder if it wouldn&#x2019;t be easier on you to just ditch her somewhere.<br>
<br>
After some more walking, you spot something moving in the gloom ahead, near the library entrance. Stopping in your tracks, you reach for another talisman &#x2013; there are about eight left. &#x201C;W-what is it?&#x201D; asks Yunzi nervously. As your eyes focus, you see that it is a man clothed all in black, fiddling with the door. His movements seem unsteady and fatigued. &#x201C;Do you see? That man?&#x201D; you whisper. She squints, peering down the dimly lit corridor. &#x201C;I can barely make him out&#x2026; wait. That silhouette looks familiar. I think he is one of the leaders that attacked us at Wufushan.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you certain? I wouldn&#x2019;t be so sure about recognizing someone from just a silhouette.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shut up. I&#x2019;ll be certain after I&#x2019;ve brought him down and taken a good look at him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The man opens the door and enters the room. The both of you creep forward quietly. By the time you reach the door, you hear a girl giggling inside. &#x201C;Well, that can&#x2019;t be good,&#x201D; you sigh. &#x201C;We should go check out the other places, right?&#x201D; asks Yunzi hopefully. You shake your head. &#x201C;Of course not. This is perfect. Hold this.&#x201D; Passing the candle to her, you pull out a talisman. Then, you draw your sword and kick down the door, leaping inside with a shout.<br>
<br>
You see the man in the embrace of a pale, half-dressed girl, their lips locked together. Yunzi stifles a gasp behind you. As the ethereal girl draws back, you can see wispy tendrils of fog being drawn into her mouth from the man&#x2019;s gaping jaws. His eyes have rolled up into his head and his features seem shrivelled. The girl turns her attention to you, her eyes flat and dead. She seems rather solid for a ghost, but there is no fooling your eyes. She is not of the living, not anymore.<br>
<br>
The ghostly girl&#x2019;s nose wrinkles as she sniffs the air in your direction. &#x201C;The poisonous, foul-tasting boy? It looks like our illusions didn&#x2019;t cage you as well as we&#x2019;d hoped. What business do you have with me? You are interrupting my pleasure.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now isn&#x2019;t that funny?&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t recall asking to be knocked out and put into some lousy room. That should be my line. What business do <i>you </i>have with us?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The ghost sighs, cradling her meal gently. &#x201C;I suppose the priest you came with didn&#x2019;t explain it to you. Why should-&#x201C; You dart forward and wave a talisman in her face. With an ugly shriek, she drops the man and shrinks back, backing away from the piece of paper. &#x201C;I would appreciate some answers,&#x201D; you ask sweetly. &#x201C;Fine! Fine!&#x201D; moans the ghost in a panic. She explains with a hurried shout, &#x201C;We abduct or seduce young men so that we can partake of their <i>yang </i>energy and transfer it to our mistress, Lady Mi!&#x201D; Suddenly, your talisman burns up, turning into ashes. It looks like they do not have a long shelf-life. Before you can draw another, the ghost turns incorporeal, fading away with a frightened look on her face and escaping your questioning.<br>
<br>
With some disappointment, you turn your attention to the man on the ground. He is breathing, but barely. A glint of metal catches your attention; reaching into his robes, you pull out a silver crest with the Imperial symbol. A high-ranking palace operative? With a start, you peer at his face again. Though the feeding has aged and shrunken him, his face still remains slightly familiar. You are unable to put a name to the face, but you think he might have been a lackey of Grand Eunuch Li. His eyes open, darting wildly around the room. Then, they focus on you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing, is the coast clear?&#x201D; asks Yunzi, as if expecting you to clear the room before her royal entry. &#x201C;C-can I come in?&#x201D; She seems about to panic. &#x201C;In a moment,&#x201D; you call back. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s something fishy about the room.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;&#x201D; exhales the man on the floor. His shriveled arm grabs yours &#x2013; in the dim light you can make out a circular tattoo of a black dragon on his wrist. Could he have some sort of connection with the Black Dragon Society? Even in his weakened state his grip is strong enough that you cannot break it easily. The man&#x2019;s gaze wanders all over your face, and a sudden light of recognition dawns in his glazed eyes. &#x201C;You&#x2026; are you&#x2026;&#x201D; he groans.<br>
<br>
You look at him impassively. &#x201C;Xu Jing! H-hurry up! I think there&#x2019;s a strange wind blowing outside here!&#x201D; It&#x2019;s probably just her imagination, but you should decide what to do quickly.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You can end his life quickly and bloodlessly &#x2013; Yunzi would likely be too nervous of her surroundings to check the corpse properly, and you can blame it on the ghost. An agent of the secret police and possible member of the Black Dragon Society that has recognized you and is likely working for Eunuch Li is a person you cannot allow to live.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>There are too many questions you need to ask him. You keep him alive for now so that you and Yunzi can interrogate him &#x2013; if he was truly part of the swordsmen that attacked her, this means things are a lot more complicated than you had been led to believe. You can always try to silence him later, though you are not certain you will get a better chance.

            <h3>三十九 · Lady Mi</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Lady Mi<br>
</span></b><br>
You reach out, preparing to kill him with a swift blow. Considering his current condition it would probably be swift mercy. Your hand pauses, hesitating as he stares at you. It is strange &#x2013; just a few years before you would probably have plunged a dagger in his neck without a second thought, but now, when you are able to take a life easily with your bare hands, you find yourself wondering if you should kill a helpless man. Your hesitation does not last long, however. This is for the sake of ridding Shun of his enemy&#x2019;s pawn. No matter what, the eunuchs are ultimately out to secure their own power, and if Shun is to wield and exercise influence on the throne that would go against their interests. The eunuchs and their lackeys can never be trusted.<br>
<br>
In the next second, the light in the man&#x2019;s eyes is snuffed out forever. You take the imperial crest from his clothes and tuck it into your own. It may come in handy in the future.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He&#x2019;s dead,&#x201D; you call out to Yunzi. &#x201C;It looks like the ghost drained him dry.&#x201D; As she steps tentatively into the room, you step aside to allow her a look at the corpse. With some trepidation, she creeps closer to the dead body and begins examining it. &#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;I need to find out exactly who is after me,&#x201D; she mutters, &#x201C;Perhaps he&#x2019;s got something on him as identification. Don&#x2019;t distract me.&#x201D; She spots the tattoo on his wrist and holds it up. &#x201C;What is this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A black dragon, it looks like,&#x201D; you shrug. &#x201C;Perhaps the Black Dragon Society? Have you heard of them?&#x201D; She shakes her head. You begin to explain. &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t call them orthodox. Far from it. Why were you convinced the people who attacked you were of the orthodox sects?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who else would attack us? I also recognized some of them using orthodox techniques, though not all,&#x201D; she replies, trying to recall details of the attack. &#x201C;Anyway, where would I find this Black Dragon Society? I would have words with them-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The entire mansion shakes, shuddering right down into its very foundations. You hear an unearthly scream from the direction of the main hall, and a fierce yell &#x2013; it sounds like the Taoist, Zhong Hai. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D; shouts Yunzi, looking anxiously down the corridor. You nod and take the lead, sprinting down the corridor. The lanterns flicker and go out as you pass them, but you allow your senses to lead the way. Your surroundings gradually grow colder. The sound of the rain and thunder fade away, leaving behind an eerie silence broken occasionally by faint sounds of battle ahead of you.<br>
<br>
A fierce duel greets your sight when you arrive at the main foyer. Though Xiahou Yu is nowhere to be seen, the Taoist is battling a beautiful middle-aged lady, his wooden sword making wide sweeping arcs that repel the woman&#x2019;s long, extending sleeves. &#x201C;I wonder how much cloth she&#x2019;s hiding in there,&#x201D; you mutter as Yunzi comes to a stop behind you. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s Lady Mi, the mistress of the mansion!&#x201D; she exclaims.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I suppose she&#x2019;s a ghost too. By the way, did they offer you anything to eat while you were their esteemed guest?&#x201D; Her face immediately turns green as she suppresses the urge to vomit. You chuckle, preparing to go to the Taoist&#x2019;s aid. &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re too scared, you can sit this one out.&#x201D; She gives you a painful punch in the back. &#x201C;Y-You forget who you are talking to. I won&#x2019;t lose to a pervert.&#x201D; You leap into the fray, Yunzi following soon after while muttering a foreign prayer. Instantly, two long strips of fabric shoot out from the woman&#x2019;s sleeves to intercept the both of you. You cut yours down easily, while Yunzi grabs the one sent after her in her hands. It begins to smoulder. Lady Mi arches her painted eyebrow, turning her gaze to the Holy Maiden.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is this? I give you shelter and you attack your hostess for the sake of a man? Come, child, he has poisoned your thoughts. This is not your fight.&#x201D; says the lady of the mansion, her voice reverberating throughout the hall though her mouth does not move.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This sounds strangely familiar-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Where have I heard this before-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
You speak at the same time as Yunzi does. Pausing, the two of you look at each other. You can&#x2019;t help but give a wry smile, just slightly, and she appears to do the same. &#x201C;Oh come now, pay attention to the enemy, boy!&#x201D; shouts Zhong Hai as he barrels past you, guzzling from his gourd of wine. He spits out the wine at Lady Mi, who leaps back with a look of deadly anger on her face. You dart to the right, Yunzi to the left. A spirit she might be, but she remains corporeal; perhaps the Taoist has pinned her down via some ritual. Though her sleeves are a weapon that you have not encountered before, you are able to grasp its movements rather easily &#x2013; even in your current condition you can manage to fend off her attacks.<br>
<br>
You slowly close the distance, slashing at the unending waves of cloth. There seems to be no limit to the amount of fabric she is shooting out, and it would probably be a bad idea to get caught by one of those strips. Suddenly, Lady Mi gives out a cry. Moving faster than you can, Yunzi had managed to weave her way through and deliver a powerful blow to the woman. As Lady Mi staggers backwards, the Taoist takes his chance and dives forward, driving his wooden sword straight at her chest. It hits her, causing green smoke to spew forth.<br>
<br>
There is a sudden change in the atmosphere. Opening her mouth so wide that her jaw appears to have come unhinged, the woman roars, a deep, guttural sound that rattles your bones. A sudden gust of strong wind knocks all of you back. You skid across the polished floorboards, coming to a painful halt against a nearby pillar.<br>
<br>
Lady Mi&#x2019;s form begins to distort. A dark miasma begins emanating from her person. Her throat balloons. Her skin turns a greenish gray, and her eyes go yellow, bulging outwards. The once painted lips split, growing wider and thicker. She lets out a single croak.<br>
<br>
Then, faster than your eyes can follow, a dark pink tongue unfurls itself from her gaping maw and lashes out at Zhong Hai. It catches him and retracts, pulling him towards the spirit. With a monstrous laugh, Lady Mi twirls her head around and smashes the Taoist through a wall. Before you or Yunzi can react, she crouches briefly before hopping forward, clearing the entire length of the hall in a single bound. A pair of palms strike you in the abdomen hard &#x2013; you find yourself soaring through the air, dazed. Yunzi is struck down easily before you have landed, unable to put up any resistance against the slimy monster.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Toad demoness,&#x201D; groans Zhong Hai, as he stumbles out of the hole in the wall. &#x201C;A powerful one, too. I came unprepared. Boy, when you see an opening, run.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Foolish humans,&#x201D; growls Lady Mi. &#x201C;I will have you all die here.&#x201D; She turns back to attack Zhong Hai again, perhaps correctly seeing him as the real threat, but before she can do so there is a loud keening in the air.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not if I can help it!&#x201D; Xiahou Yu runs into the foyer, a beautiful girl &#x2013; ghost &#x2013; by his side. A dozen other ghosts appear, swarming the toad demoness and pinning it down as it screams. &#x201C;There you are,&#x201D; you say irritably from your prone position on the ground. &#x201C;Could you please tell me what is going on?&#x201D; Yu nods, though he says &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll explain everything after we get out of here, Jing. First, we have a demon to subdue.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Brother Yu, my sisters and I will suppress the demon, but we cannot hold out forever. She is too powerful. Please, run!&#x201D; pleads the girl, holding onto Yu&#x2019;s hands.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will not abandon you here, Xiaoqing.&#x201D; The scholar shakes his head while grasping her hands firmly. &#x201C;It is okay, I have figured out a way to defeat the demoness. Remember what you told me about my friend being immune to ghostly <i>qi </i>draining because his <i>qi </i>was somehow poisonous to you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, Yu, I see where you are going and I do not like it!&#x201D; you shout out, sitting up suddenly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Jing, quickly! While the ghosts are holding down the toad demoness, kiss it! Kiss it deeply! I am quite certain that will destroy it!&#x201D; shouts Xiahou Yu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are out of your mind! Look at that mouth, it&#x2019;s big enough to <i>eat </i>my head!&#x201D; you shout back.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s our only chance!&#x201D; he replies.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If what he says is true, it might just work, boy! Do it! If it doesn&#x2019;t work <i>then </i>we can just run!&#x201D; Zhong Hai adds his support to the plan.<br>
<br>
Yunzi laughs as she comes over to you, stretching out a hand to help you up. &#x201C;Sounds like a plan that fits your perverted tendencies. Besides, that&#x2019;s the sort of thing you are only fit to kiss, with your filthy lips.&#x201D; You glare at her.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>She&#x2019;s crossed the line. If you are going to kiss a monster, you might as well kiss a beautiful girl too, to balance things out. It&#x2019;s too bad that she&#x2019;s the only living one around, but she&#x2019;ll have to do. You steal a kiss from her for that uppity remark before jumping in to kiss the toad demoness. Hopefully this works.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>They are right &#x2013; well, <i>if </i>they are right, this is the best thing you can do. You will bravely sacrifice your own lips for the sake of the greater good, and kiss the toad demoness. No matter what snide comments Yunzi makes, you are doing this for your comrades, not because you want to kiss those slimy big lips. You are not a pervert.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>There is no way you are going to do this. The ghosts are giving you an opening; it is time to make a run for it rather than put your lips to the task of pressing themselves up against glistening, drippy, fleshy toad demon mouths. <i>What if it tongues you? </i>Just thinking about it is enough to make you shudder. Running is the definitely right choice here. If you run, the others will be forced to follow.

            <h3>四十 · Road to Xiangyang, Again</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Road to Xiangyang, Again.</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you insist,&#x201D; you grumble, grasping her hand. You don&#x2019;t know why you did it, not one bit. As she pulls you up, you take the opportunity to dart forwards, tugging her against you. Your lips press up against hers gently and briefly. Her eyes widen in surprise as she freezes up. You let her go with a sly grin. &#x201C;Well, those filthy lips have now degraded your own, princess,&#x201D; you say mockingly, though your heart is thumping rather furiously underneath your blas&#xE9; exterior for reasons you do not quite understand. Leaving behind the stunned girl trying to get to grips with what has just happened, you turn towards the toad demon and break into a sprint.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, here goes nothing!&#x201D; As you approach, every fine detail of those wrinkled, slimy lips come into focus. You leap onto the monstrous Lady Mi. Gritting your teeth, you clamp your mouth over its maw. Nothing is happening. You feel the mushy flesh sliding around and the stank, fetid breath of the surprised monster. Nothing seems to be happening, except for a certain nasty catch in your throat that is about to cause you to empty your stomach. &#x201C;Blow! Blow into it!&#x201D; shouts Xiahou Yu. Cursing the day you stepped foot into this mansion, you blow as hard as you can. The demon shrieks. Plumes of foul green vapour begin shooting out from its skin as it scratches at you, attempting to pull you off, but you can sense it weakening. Still, it is not dead.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is not enough,&#x201D; shouts Zhong Hai. &#x201C;We need to take more conclusive action! Keep it occupied while I set up the talismans!&#x201D; You are unable to ask how long he needs, as the wild, sticky tongue of the toad demoness suddenly finds its way halfway down your throat. You gag, but your willpower keeps you clinging on as you continue to breath into your opponent, your lips closed firmly over its own. You wave your hand about in a panic, hoping that they&#x2019;ll hurry up &#x2013; you cannot hold on for much longer. After what seems like an eternity, there is a flash of lightning. You feel a round, smooth object, much like a large pearl, being pushed into your mouth. Stuck in the position that you are, you cannot help but swallow. The demon shrieks. The object of your long kiss evaporates, turning into a puff of pale smoke and scattering into thin air.<br>
<br>
Almost instantly, your surroundings seem to shift and change. Light begins to stream in through the small holes in the roof and the half open windows. For some reason, it is now day. You cough and sputter, groaning as you try to gulp in as much air as you can. Even the dusty atmosphere of the abandoned mansion is better than that stench you endured while kissing the demon.<br>
<br>
But for now, things seem to be over.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You find the other two men in black sucked dry of their vitality, leaving behind nothing but dried up corpses. A few of the young villagers were still alive, but it seems that most of them had expired by the time Zhong Hai found them. The mansion had not always been a site for such horrors; as it turns out, it had once belonged to Yang Xue, the greatest traitor to the country in recent history. Though his immediate family had not stayed here, it had served as a residence for some of his closer kin. Upon his betrayal, an Imperial edict had decreed the death of everyone in the mansion. They had not resisted, but their end was bloody anyway. Upon hearing the edict, the women hung themselves to prevent violation prior to their execution. Some years later, the toad demoness moved in, enslaving the resident spirits and demanding that they supply her with fresh <i>yang </i>energy by kidnapping and seducing any males they come across.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now we are free, thanks to you, Brother Yu,&#x201D; says the remaining ghost, Xiaoqing, primly &#x2013; the others had dissolved into the sunlight with peaceful smiles. She had been one of the maids of the mansion prior to her death; now she was seated under an umbrella, shielding her from the sun. Her voice is weak, as it seems daylight does not agree with ghosts. &#x201C;My sisters have moved on to join the cycle of reincarnation.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t I get any thanks?&#x201D; you mutter, though the scholar and the ghost do not seem to hear you. &#x201C;All&#x2019;s well that ends well, young one,&#x201D; smiles the bearded exorcist as he claps you on the back. &#x201C;By the way, did you find the toad&#x2019;s pearl when it was destroyed? I could not see it anywhere.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The toad&#x2019;s pearl?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, a portion of the culmination of its essence. For a demon that strong, it must have lived for more more than three hundred years. The pearl would be a crystallized form of the energy it cultivated&#x2026; not all of it, but perhaps at least hundred years&#x2019; worth. It is quite valuable, and useful in rituals,&#x201D; sighs the Taoist. &#x201C;It would be a waste if it went missing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2026; ah&#x2026;&#x201D; You recall the object that you swallowed. &#x201C;I appear to have eaten it, by accident.&#x201D; Zhong Hai&#x2019;s bushy eyebrows rise as he stares at you. Then, he shrugs. &#x201C;Is that so? Well, such is fate, I suppose. I will prescribe you some talismans &#x2013; burn it, mix the ashes into water, and drink it if one day you should find yourself exhibiting toad-like behaviour. Hopefully the demonic energy will not interfere too much with your <i>qi</i>, though your case is rather strange in the first place. I do not know what will happen, but I will pray for your well-being.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It would be much better if you turned into a toad and died off,&#x201D; mutters Yunzi as she passes by you, carrying a bundle of belongings that she retrieved from the mansion. &#x201C;It would at least stop you from violating maidens with&#x2026;&#x201D; She falters, her cheeks flushing as she bites her lips. Your eyes are drawn to her mouth as she does so. Unexpectedly, you find your face burning up in return. &#x201C;Y-you&#x2019;re acting strange,&#x201D; you retort awkwardly, trying to find something to say to banish this strange embarrassment over something you have done a thousand times before. &#x201C;Finish your sentences if you have the guts for it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A pervert doesn&#x2019;t deserve my words,&#x201D; she says hastily, before turning away to tie her belongings to the horse.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem to become just like a little kid when you&#x2019;re around her, Jing,&#x201D; says Xiahou Yu cheerfully as he walks towards you with an antique umbrella over his shoulder. You find yourself too tired to even respond to his good-natured taunt. Instead, you settle for asking about the umbrella. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s that? Loot from the mansion?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, Xiaoqing transferred into it,&#x201D; he says casually. &#x201C;She will be accompanying us on the journey. I tried to refuse but she insisted, saying that she owed me a debt.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is not unprecedented,&#x201D; muses Zhong Hai. &#x201C;Just be careful not to overdo it, young scholar. I know it might be pleasurable but it harms your vitality.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xiahou Yu blushes. &#x201C;No, it is not like that. We do not have that sort of relationship.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would be more worried about the perverted dog, Taoist,&#x201D; says Yunzi. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s likely to go at it until he dies of exhaustion.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh? Stop talking about things you have no experience in, you frigid girl,&#x201D; you say loudly. Her eyes flash angrily, glaring at you as if she&#x2019;d like nothing more than to tear your throat out and watch you bleed to death on the ground. &#x201C;Now, now, can&#x2019;t we all just get along?&#x201D; says Xiahou Yu, awkwardly attempting to defuse the situation. &#x201C;Jing, this really isn&#x2019;t like you. Is there something going on that I am unaware of?&#x201D; You look up at the sky for a while before sighing. &#x201C;No, not really,&#x201D; you say at last, scratching your head. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re right. I&#x2019;m sorry, Yunzi. Can we stop the fighting? That&#x2019;s not what I&#x2019;m here for.&#x201D; She looks at you disbelievingly, surprised at your apology.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-well,&#x201D; she begins, &#x201C;if you understand your position then I am satisfied. I shouldn&#x2019;t have been so quick to anger in the first place, so&#x2026; anyway, did you say that the man in black was part of the Black Dragon Society?&#x201D; Yunzi swiftly tries to change the subject away from strange apologies. You take that chance gratefully, as you had been starting to feel rather awkward about what you just said. &#x201C;I think he <i>may </i>be part of them, but I am not certain,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is enough to go on. Do you know where I can find them? I suppose I should investigate just what they are up to.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about your faithful followers?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;Do you not need to meet up with them?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is no need, Man Tiger Pig,&#x201D; says a quiet voice from behind you &#x2013; you sensed him just before he spoke. Whirling around, you see Vahista a fair distance away, imposing in his steady, patient stance. Zhong Hai and Xiahou Yu look at you, and then at the newcomer. &#x201C;We always have a watchful eye on our Holy Maiden.&#x201D; He pauses for a while, then continues with a self-effacing smile &#x201C;Though I must admit, I was stumped about gaining entry to the mansion.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Vahista.&#x201D; Yunzi&#x2019;s voice is now imperious and filled with command. &#x201C;What are you doing here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am here to escort you back, O Holy Maiden. It was unfortunate that you were separated from us during the ambush at Wufushan, but we did all we could to find you again. Our Lord of the Light was rather concerned. He would much rather you did not consort with strange men.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And I thank you for your efforts, Vahista. However, the date of betrothal is still three years away. He need not concern himself with my actions just yet,&#x201D; replies Yunzi steadily.<br>
<br>
Vahista laughs loudly. &#x201C;Oh, you misunderstand me. Our master knows that you will return to him in due time. It is just that he needs to understand the company you keep, and how it will affect his plans.&#x201D; There is a sudden wave of killing intent from him. Your brows furrow &#x2013; will it turn into a fight?<br>
<br>
Yunzi replies quickly, &#x201C;The company I keep-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
You interrupt Yunzi, getting slightly irked by the conversation. &#x201C;-is with a pervert. There, you&#x2019;re looking at him,&#x201D; you declare, finishing her sentence. &#x201C;There you have it,&#x201D; sighs Yunzi. &#x201C;This is the rude lout that somehow crosses my path, as if I am cursed.&#x201D; You glare at her before continuing &#x201C;I will spare no woman my attentions, but mark my words, there is one woman on this earth that I would not touch besides my mother, and that is this shrew over here. I would rather <i>die </i>than touch a single hair on this loathsome toad. How does that affect your great lord&#x2019;s plans now, Vahista?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Vahista just smiles. &#x201C;Not at all, if that is the case.&#x201D; He casts a glance at you, then at Yunzi. &#x201C;What do you plan to do now, Holy Maiden?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I plan to track down the conspirators that ambushed us at Wufushan and punish them for the glory of our temple. It is something that you need not concern yourself with &#x2013; busy yourself with preparing for the challenge against the Eight Sects.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The man nods, bowing low. &#x201C;Your will is the will of my Lord, Holy Maiden. I will obey your orders. Please return to us safely after your investigations are complete.&#x201D; He steps back, and with a nimble leap, vanishes into the trees. You do not sense his presence anymore &#x2013; likely he has retreated as he said.<br>
<br>
Yunzi sighs, apparently taxed by that conversation. &#x201C;Well, I cannot waste any more time on you, Xu Jing,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;We will part ways here. May we never meet again.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You offer to go with Xiangyang to help her. She does not need to know what you are really there for.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You explain that you too have business at the Black Dragon Society regarding Xiahou Yu&#x2019;s lady friend, though you keep your real motives a secret - you offer to go together.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You reveal the truth of why you will be going to the Black Dragon Society; you see no need to continue lying to them, and things may go more smoothly if you don&apos;t keep secrets.<br>
<b>1. </b>You reveal it to Yunzi only.<br>
<b>2. </b>You reveal it to Xiahou Yu only.<br>
<b>3. </b>You reveal it to both. <br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You let her go on her own way &#x2013; you will act separately from her for your own investigations when you arrive in Xiangyang.

            <h3>四十一 · Enter the Black Dragon</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Enter the Black Dragon</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;This Liu Chanfeng,&#x201D; says Yunzi, &#x201C;She&#x2019;s the one that attacked us a few years back, right?&#x201D; There is a slight gleam in her eyes; one more of excitement than vengeance &#x2013; you know that feeling. Having been beaten rather soundly by the woman before, you would be pleased to test your skills against her one more time&#x2026; though you might not be in the best condition to do so. She likely feels the same, though you cannot rule out that she would also be curious about the woman&apos;s role in the assault on the Ashina tribe. You nod. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I just need her to clarify a few things about that raid.&#x201D; Xiahou Yu sighs, resting his chin on his palms. &#x201C;I suppose it was too good to be true, that you would free me and accompany me on my quest with no strings attached.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry for not being upfront,&#x201D; you say.  He shakes his head thoughtfully. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s alright. I would probably have done the same had I been in your position, out of duty to my benefactor. I am glad that you told me now, though I would never have guessed that you hailed from such a prestigious background. Besides&#x2026; we have more pressing issues to worry about.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The scholar is right. Upon reaching Xiangyang, you had soon discovered that the situation had changed rather drastically from what you had expected to find. The streets were abuzz with rumours that the Black Dragon Society had wiped out the Wunan Sect in a surprise attack just a day ago. Many reasons were bandied about; some said that the Black Dragon Society had kidnapped the women to sell into slavery to the western regions, while others said that the leader of the Wunan Sect had a bounty put on her head, and that the Black Dragon Society had been encouraged to collect in excessive fashion. There were also those that whispered of an Imperial decree involved in this assault, that the Wunan Sect had somehow offended the palace.<br>
<br>
You are not sure whether any of those rumours have any truth to them, but there is one thing that you can be certain about: the Black Dragon Society currently has Liu Chanfeng captive. It took some digging on your part, but it seems that a few Black Dragon mercenaries have been bragging about how they took down that &#x2018;frigid scarred nutso bitch&#x2019; in the taverns. From their description it could not be anyone else. She was currently imprisoned in their headquarters, a small fortress about an hour&#x2019;s travel from the city that had been granted to them by the prefect of Xiangyang in return for their assistance with keeping order in the countryside.<br>
<br>
For now, you would have to decide what to do next:<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Investigate Shennong Forest and the Wunan Sect &#x2013; if truly an attack occurred, you might still be able to find clues in the aftermath, and perhaps survivors, to give you a clearer picture of what has happened. It will probably take you more than three days to find the place, however.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Attempt to sneak into the Black Dragon Society headquarters. You will go in under the cover of darkness and make your way to the prison. This is the quickest way for you to get in touch with your target.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Approach the Black Dragon Society as potential recruits. After some discussion, all three of you are fairly certain that they will not recognize Yunzi as long as she keeps a simple disguise, if they are even looking out for her in the first place.<br>
<b>1. </b>Approach with your true identity.<br>
<b>2. </b>Approach with a false identity.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>Walk in brazenly and request to see the prisoner. If it boils down to a trade of favours you are willing to negotiate, but you do not see the need to hide what you came for; Yu has a good enough excuse to meet her without needing to delve into your own motives.

            <h3>四十二 · The Two Masters of the Fort</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Two Masters of the Fort</span></b><br>
<br>
The fortress of the Black Dragon Society is an interesting construct. Built in the days of the Han dynasty, it was once a dilapidated fort on the outskirts of what would become Xiangyang. In the hands of the Society, however, they had built down, not up. Rather than turning the fortress into a more defensible location by strengthening its walls, they had instead chosen to tunnel deep into the earth. It was rumoured that there were a hundred and eight secret exits and entrances to the fortress, each filled with deadly traps against outsiders. Of course, as with every rumour that gets bandied about, it is most likely mere exaggeration.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is it true that there a hundred and eight secret tunnels leading out of this place?&#x201D; you ask one of the guards at the gate. He peers at you suspiciously, hefting his spear into a ready position. &#x201C;Who&#x2019;s asking?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My name is Xu Jing. I seek an audience with your leader,&#x201D; you say politely. Yunzi and Xiahou Yu stand quietly behind, having agreed &#x2013; Yunzi grudgingly so &#x2013; to leave the talking to you. The guard snorts at you. &#x201C;Who? Our leaders are not free today, so get out of here before I make you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I said,&#x201D; you repeat, stepping closer, &#x201C;I am Xu Jing of Maniac Island. I want to see your bosses <i>now</i>.&#x201D; The guard&#x2019;s spear lowers threateningly at your approach, but you merely stare contemptuously at the point of his weapon aimed at your throat. Then, you grin, baring your teeth. Your eyes meet his. The guard shrinks back slightly, not knowing whether to think you confident or foolhardy. &#x201C;H-hold on, Xu Jing, was it?&#x201D; interrupts his comrade. &#x201C;Maniac Island? Disciple of the Southern Maniac? Just wait here for a second!&#x201D; It takes many long minutes instead of a second, but during that time the guard never lowers his spear, nor do you take a step back. When the second guard returns, panting, he gives you the okay to proceed &#x2013; the masters of the Black Dragon Society have deigned to meet you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The leaders of the Black Dragon Society are two brothers &#x2013; Hei Zuolong and Hei Youlong. The former is the elder, and a weaselly looking man, while the latter is the younger, and built much like a bear with almost as much hair to match. You have not seen them in action, but they are renowned as martial artists. Hei Youlong is the first to speak as the three of you enter the audience hall.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple doing here?&#x201D; He does not seem too pleased at your presence, though there is a faint smile on his older brother&#x2019;s face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I found myself passing through Xiangyang and decided to come pay respect to my elders in the <i>jianghu</i>, in hopes that we may be bestowed a favour,&#x201D; you reply. &#x201C;That is what I am doing here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see. It is an agreeable trait in youngsters to be respectful.&#x201D; says Hei Zuolong, his voice thin and sharp. Hei Youlong, on the other hand, has a grim expression. &#x201C;A favour? What favour is it?&#x201D; he asks. You shrug. &#x201C;A simple favour, one that is entirely within your power to grant, I am sure. My friend here has an acquaintance that you are keeping under custody. A woman with a red mark on her face. He would like to speak with her for a personal reason.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The younger Hei brother frowns. &#x201C;<i>That </i>traitor? What makes you think you can just walk in here and ask for that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;If this favour is granted I will be in your debt.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Hei Zuolong laughs suddenly. &#x201C;A trade of favours?&#x201D; His eyes fix themselves upon you keenly &#x2013; you do not like his stare. &#x201C;Oh, I have heard of your exploits, Xu Jing. Winning the martial arts competition, defeating a hundred men. For someone whose name has just emerged in the pugilistic world you seem to be making some rather interesting waves. Very impressive.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I appreciate the compliment, Master Hei,&#x201D; you bow.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A trade of favours,&#x201D; he repeats to himself, before chuckling. &#x201C;You know that I cannot trust you to keep your word, right?&#x201D; You frown. &#x201C;What are you implying?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You do not exactly have a reputation for being&#x2026; reliable,&#x201D; says Hei Zuolong with relish. &#x201C;You are a free spirit &#x2013; you do what suits you at any given time. Any favour I trade with you will be only on your terms; you would break your oath with no qualms if you ever disliked the way I call in your debt. I think that is hardly fair. It would be rather <i>difficult </i>to deal with you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Judge not a man by idle gossip, Master Hei,&#x201D; you say.  &#x201C;I am not the sort to disregard a debt. We do not ask for much in the first place.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But you <i>do</i>,&#x201D; says Zuolong, leaning forward while his eyes gleam. &#x201C;Some very important people have taken an interest in our female guest here. If we let you see her, who knows what could happen? I could find myself dead over this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is a waste of time,&#x201D; growls Youlong. &#x201C;Brother, let me throw them out and be done with it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; muses Zuolong. &#x201C;Someone who knows her and wants to speak to her could also be a person of interest to our client, regardless of their reason...&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You hear Yunzi tapping her feet behind you. She is getting slightly impatient with the lack of progress; it looks like she would prefer to retreat and attempt another approach. Looking straight at Hei Zuolong, you say, &#x201C;If there is nothing I can say to change your mind, perhaps we will take our leave.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, don&#x2019;t be so hasty. I would not send an acquaintance of Liu Chanfeng&#x2019;s away without letting them meet &#x2013; in fact, I insist that you allow me to do so. I was just testing your sincerity,&#x201D; replies the weaselly man, grinning. He waves his hand. Though you do not see them, you hear the footsteps of a few dozen men shifting into position outside the hall. &#x201C;I also do not want to cross your master, so I will help you out, and you will owe me a little favour. It is your friend, the bookish fellow over there, that wants to speak with the woman, no? I will let him meet with her. Not alone, of course. One of you will go along with him. The other will stay here until their meeting is done. For security purposes, you see.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You glance back at your companions. Yunzi is glaring at you &#x2013; she knows full well what situation the three of you are in right now. Hei Zuolong has made the offer in a manner that you cannot refuse. It would be suicidal to attempt to escape the fortress at this point. You would not get ten steps from the hall before being cut down by the enemy - pugilists are one thing, but you have seen the mercenaries training with bows on your way in, and you are not confident in your ability to avoid a rain of arrows. You are not sure what is going through the Black Dragon master&#x2019;s mind to suddenly make this offer, but you do not trust him. Xiahou Yu, on the other hand, is looking at you calmly. He nods; he is signalling for you to accept the offer.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You accept the offer. You do not see any other choice for now; perhaps there will be an opening for you to take advantage of later.<br>
<b>1. </b>You select Yunzi to go with Xiahou Yu, while you stay in the hall. It may be better for you to deal directly with the masters and talk to them while they are here.<br>
<b>2. </b>You go along with Xiahou Yu so that you can oversee his conversation with Liu Chanfeng. Yunzi can take care of herself even if you leave her alone.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You reject the offer; if he is going to attack you, so be it. It could, as unlikely as it is, be a bluff&#x2026; or you could be lucky enough to escape from the midst of their fortress. Whatever it is, you will not be forced to go on the Black Dragon Society&#x2019;s terms.

            <h3>四十三 · The Hospitality of the Hei Brothers</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Hospitality of the Hei Brothers</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very well, I will remain here to enjoy your hospitality.&#x201D; You offer to stay behind while Xiahou Yu and Yunzi are escorted to meet Liu Chanfeng in the cells. Yunzi makes a noise of protest. &#x201C;I should be here-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know you cannot bear to be apart from me, my dear,&#x201D; you say quickly, interrupting her, &#x201C;but this is for the best. I am sure your uncle would agree &#x2013; he did leave you in my care at the mansion after we reunited. Trust me on this.&#x201D; To her credit, she understands  instantly; you are referring to Vahista, and implicitly telling her that you have not forgotten about the ambush on the Fire Cult at Wufushan. She will have to trust you to squeeze some details out about that incident on her behalf. &#x201C;Fine.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With an exasperated sigh, she turns away from you, her shoulders resigned. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t do anything stupid.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right back at you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The doors close behind them with a heavy bang as they leave with the guards, leaving you with Hei Zuolong and Youlong. The elder Hei has a sly grin on his face. &#x201C;Your wife?&#x201D; You can tell that he is trying to calculate how to use this to his benefit. &#x201C;It is a long story,&#x201D; you sigh, &#x201C;but we are not properly wedded. She is a real handful.&#x201D; He lets out a little chuckle in response. &#x201C;Yes, I can tell. A real fiery steed, that one. It won&#x2019;t be easy to break her. Perhaps I should teach you how?&#x201D; Hei Zuolong&#x2019;s eyes shine with amusement.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, thank you. I like her unbroken,&#x201D; you reply firmly, trying not to let his casual remarks shake your focus. In doing so, you mirror his arrogant grin, staring right back at the man. He raises his eyebrows and shrugs. &#x201C;Suit yourself. Now, what did I want to do next? Ah, that&#x2019;s right. Youlong.&#x201D; Zuolong waves his fingers lazily. The brawny younger brother nods, getting off his chair. Hei Youlong begins  to walk towards you, his stance growing in menace with every step.<br>
<br>
You remain still.<br>
<br>
A few more steps and he will be in range to strike.<br>
<br>
You try to keep your focus, suppressing the urge to take up a fighting stance.<br>
<br>
It is clear what he will attempt, but the question is: will it hit?<br>
<br>
Hei Youlong draws even closer, step by step.<br>
<br>
Then, he lashes out at you.<br>
<br>
His fist is fast. In your current condition there is no way you could evade it even if you see it coming. His attack skims the side of your face; it was never going to hit you. You look at the well-built man in front of you, a slightly quizzical expression on your face. &#x201C;Well?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Youlong grimaces. &#x201C;You are Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple, aren&#x2019;t you? But I sense no killing intent of any sort, even when I attacked.&#x201D; That is  because you know that you cannot hurt either of these men in a fight at the moment. Any killing intent is wasted, and would likely inflame Hei Youlong&apos;s desire for a fight. Besides, you saw through his attack, understanding that it was never meant to land &#x2013; they are merely testing you for now. What you say, however, is this: &#x201C;That is because I am a pacifist.&#x201D; You smile as kindly as you can manage.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A pacifist?&#x201D; rumbles Hei Youlong. &#x201C;What nonsense is that? <i>You</i>, a pacifist?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I am deadly serious. I am a pacifist following the path of non-violence. I truly believe in rendering my enemies pacified so that they will not commit violence against me.&#x201D; Your gaze sharpens, though your smile never leaves your face. Hei Zuolong shifts ever so slightly on his ornate chair, your words and confidence serving to wipe that grin away and put a thoughtful expression on his face. His younger brother only frowns and takes a cautious step back. You beam at them. &#x201C;You may put my pacifism to the test if you wish.&#x201D; Of course, you are running on pure bravado at this point. You know for certain that you will be unable to defeat even one of them, let alone both.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is no need. No more tests, you have proven yourself to be a worthy guest at the Black Dragon Society,&#x201D; replies Zuolong with his usual grin. &#x201C;Let us entertain you while you await the return of your friend.&#x201D; He snaps his fingers and barks out a quick order. A few female servants hurry in, setting up a table for drinking. You recognize the cowed heads, the familiar behaviour of slaves ruled by fear. A slight disquiet nestling in your chest, you sit down at the table with the two brothers. After you subtly make sure that the wine and cups are not poisoned, the drinking begins, the slave girls coming to refill your cups every now and then. You drink in little, occasional sips, taking care not to imbibe too much too fast. The conversation kicks off with talk of the tournament, as Youlong asks about your fights, and goes on to talk about the current state of the <i>jianghu</i>: from what you can tell, the brothers seem rather optimistic about the future for some reason.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If I may ask, Masters Hei,&#x201D; Taking an advantage in a lull in the conversation, you change the topic. &#x201C;I have heard that you deal with the transaction of bodies.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Dead and alive, yes,&#x201D; replies the younger Hei. &#x201C;Even the prefect of Xiangyang recognizes our contributions in this matter. There are some criminals that the law cannot touch.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Criminals that we can certainly <i>touch</i>,&#x201D; says his older brother, laughing as he pulls a slave girl onto his lap. She does not struggle but only looks at the floor meekly &#x2013; the girl cannot be older than fifteen. You wonder what crimes she had committed to become a legal slave; free commoners could not be enslaved by the law of the Tang. Zuolong continues, &#x201C;We will not claim to do Heaven&#x2019;s justice, but nonetheless when there is no other option for redress, we stain our hands for the betterment of all.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed, and nothing is bettered more than your purses,&#x201D; you say, giving them a knowing wink. The brothers laugh. &#x201C;You are correct, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Zuolong. &#x201C;Very much so.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indulge my further curiosity, please,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;I have heard rumours that you attacked the Wunan Sect and have made captives of its members for sale. Is that so? It sounds&#x2026; illegal.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are a strange one, Xu Jing. When did you start caring about the law?&#x201D; grins Youlong good-naturedly. &#x201C;What we do is illegal in the eyes of the world anyway.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Slavery of free Han has always been something the government has viewed harshly,&#x201D; you point out. &#x201C;Forgive me, but I think it a rather risky venture. Does the prefect know of this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As it turns out, it is <i>quite </i>acceptable if they are enemies of the state, and thus traitorous criminals.&#x201D; The grin on Zuolong&#x2019;s face turns cold and mocking. His eyes are fixed on you now. &#x201C;Which is why I was wondering&#x2026; are you an enemy of the court? Is your friend one? As I said, there would be some very important people interested in anyone who is acquainted with a traitor. After all, we were tasked with dismantling an entire sect as a lesson to her.&#x201D; A brag, you think: aimed at making you fear the supposed ease at which they destroyed an entire sect and also the power their backers wield in ordering such a thing over a single person&apos;s transgressions.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose these important people pay handsomely?&#x201D; you ask innocuously, swirling the wine in your cup.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is not merely money that we deal in, Xu Jing,&#x201D; replies Zuolong.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Rich <i>and </i>powerful important people, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is there any other sort?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You shake your head. &#x201C;No, I guess not. Well, if these <i>very important</i> people are interested in anyone with anything to do with her, she must have been <i>rather</i> traitorous. What did she do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She killed some agents of the court,&#x201D; shrugs Youlong. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a death sentence, usually, but this time they have other plans for her.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I am sure they are some very interesting plans,&#x201D; you say, pondering the information you have just received.<br>
<br>
The atmosphere at the table has changed, and not for the better. Hei Zuolong bares his teeth at you and asks, &#x201C;So, tell me, Xu Jing, why <i>are </i>you here? I cannot imagine the disciple of Zhang Jue involving himself with affairs of the Imperial Court, but here you are.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve already told you,&#x201D; you say calmly, &#x201C;I am here to help out my friend.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; sneers Zuolong, continuing to press his line of enquiry. &#x201C;In my line of work, I must always think the worst of people. I do not believe that is your real reason for coming&#x2026; no, if I were you, it would surely be an excuse for some other reason. The question is, what is it a cover for?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, the question is, why do you seem so enthralled with voicing out your own suspicions?&#x201D; you say, laughing. &#x201C;Do you think it makes you look smarter?&#x201D; His face, already slightly flushed from the wine, turns red. You smile at him; you are not going to make the mistake of thinking he is actually drunk, and underestimating him as a result. That he did not immediately lunge at you over your casual provocation shows as much; it is a risky thing to do, but it is also vital to keep up your act of apparent confidence in your strength. &#x201C;You think you are so clever,&#x201D; he says with fierce amusement. Hei Youlong tenses up, preparing to go to his brother&#x2019;s aid if necessary.<br>
<br>
You look at the wine in the cup, your mind working to figure out your next step. It is confirmed now that they are in cahoots with at least one faction in the Imperial Court. Further attempts at enquiry would be difficult, however, and you still don&#x2019;t know if there is a trap waiting to be sprung.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You reveal the silver crest, attempting to impersonate an Imperial agent. You should have enough knowledge of their organization to pass for one. This seems to be the only way you can get more information out of the two, and change the situation beyond what Hei Zuolong is expecting; if there<i> is</i> a trap, waiting passively will not help you much. You need to act.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You elect to keep things as they are, and continue drinking with the two masters until whatever happens next. Impersonating a member of the palace&#x2019;s secret police is too risky: if you slip up in the act, they will have no qualms about attempting to capture you on the spot, not to mention word may spread that you are in possession of said crest, rendering it useless in the future.

            <h3>四十四 · The Imperial Agent</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Imperial Agent</span></b><br>
<br>
Without a word, you place the silver crest on the table lightly, face down. &#x201C;What is that?&#x201D; asks Hei Zuolong suspiciously. You lean back, gesturing for him to flip it over. A scowl on his weaselly face, he does so &#x2013; and the master of the Black Dragon Society instantly goes pale as the crest makes a dull clink against the wooden table. &#x201C;T-this&#x2026; where did you&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good, it looks like you recognize it. Hei Zuolong, Hei Youlong, you are fully aware what this emblem means, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Brother,&#x201D; whispers Hei Youlong nervously. &#x201C;What should we do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Leave this to me. It could be a fake,&#x201D; mutters Zuolong.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We know that is nearly impossible. The design of the emblem is not known to many, and too difficult to forge. I grant you, there might be those who can illegally replicate the symbol of the Emperor&#x2019;s secret police, but I do not know of any. Do you?&#x201D; you declare, more confidently than you feel.<br>
<br>
He shakes his head slowly, beads of sweat slowly appearing on his forehead. &#x201C;You could have stole-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you accusing me of theft, Hei Zuolong?&#x201D; you ask sharply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No&#x2026; no, of course not,&#x201D; He shakes his head and backs down. His gaze is wary &#x2013; he does not seem entirely convinced that you are the real deal, but he is too cautious to assume that you are not what you claim to be. It seems that the Black Dragon Society is &#x2013; interestingly &#x2013; rather concerned with court opinion of them. Taking a few deep breath, he calms himself and begins to speak. &#x201C;This is a most curious turn of events, Xu Jing. I did not think the young disciple of Zhang Jue would be an agent of the court. You must have started your training at a very early age.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who knows, Master Hei?&#x201D; you grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who knows indeed,&#x201D; he sighs. &#x201C;Now, <i>why </i>do we have the pleasure of your presence here today? I am sure you revealed yourself  for a reason. What business do you really have with us?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I met a colleague of mine on his way back from Wufushan,&#x201D; you reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D; Hei Zuolong raises his eyebrows. &#x201C;Wufushan. We had little part in that&#x2026; only a dozen men or so were engaged for that mission.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It raised some questions amongst my superiors,&#x201D; you continue. &#x201C;They did not know it was going to happen.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was certain Mao Sanjiao would have informed them. He is their liaison within the Eight Sects after all, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201D; grumbles Hei Zuolong. You are about to ask who Mao Sanjiao is, but stop yourself. There is a sudden glint in the man&#x2019;s eye as he looks at you &#x2013; you are probably supposed to know who this man is, if you are involved in this clandestine business. You decide to file his name away for further investigation later; it could be a false lead meant to trick you into revealing yourself.<br>
<br>
You smile at Hei Zuolong. &#x201C;It is not my business what other people get up to &#x2013; all I know is what I am ordered to do. If that is the case, I will send news back to Taiye Hall that the Black Dragon Society had little involvement, and allow those smarter than me to decide their next course of action.&#x201D; Taiye Hall is the headquarters of the secret police, dug underneath a lake near the palace &#x2013; you have been there only twice, and found it damp and altogether unwelcoming.<br>
<br>
He nods sagely, seemingly satisfied with your answer. &#x201C;Yes, of course. That would be wise. I am curious, however&#x2026; why did you need to go about things in such a roundabout manner?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A force of habit. I was coached to never reveal myself unless necessary. Besides, my companions do not know I am an agent of the court,&#x201D; you say nonchalantly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see.&#x201D; Zuolong falls silent, looking at you. You can tell that deep down, he is still unconvinced &#x2013; the man does not seem to trust easily. &#x201C;Rest assured your secret is safe with me,&#x201D; he grins suddenly. &#x201C;So, you are not really here for Liu Chanfeng?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Watching his face, you sense that it would be a mistake to claim that you are; you have very little knowledge of the Liu Chanfeng issue, and pretending you are involved with this case would probably catch you out in a lie. Again, you decide to be vague &#x2013; it works to your benefit to keep Hei Zuolong unsure, since you do not have any actual facts to convince him with. &#x201C;My friend is. It is wise of Taiye Hall to have me keep an eye on him, no?&#x201D; you laugh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, very wise indeed,&#x201D; agrees Zuolong. &#x201C;Still, if that is the case, I am afraid you have stumbled into a situation you have no business being involved with.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is not a problem. I will have my companions away from here by tomorrow.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They can be away from here, but you&#x2026; you I cannot set free.&#x201D; His eyes are cold and his grin now frosty. In the end, it looks like your little gambit hasn&#x2019;t worked out as well as you hoped.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Hei, what do you mean?&#x201D; you ask calmly, taking another sip of the wine.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You may be an Imperial agent, but I do not answer to you, Xu Jing&#x2026; if that is indeed your real name. We have dealings here that are rather&#x2026; delicate. We cannot have you making the wrong sort of reports to Taiye Hall now, can we?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh, placing the cup down on the table gently. &#x201C;I will report as I see fit. Are you going to try and attack me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nothing of the sort, Xu Jing.&#x201D; Zuolong shakes his head, though Hei Youlong has already gotten up. You give him a dismissive glance, though you keep your guard up. &#x201C;You must understand&#x2026; we need to present a coherent narrative to Taiye Hall, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t say I disagree. What do you have in mind?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You see, it&#x2019;s not what <i>I </i>have in mind that matters. It is what <i>your </i>colleague thinks,&#x201D; he replies. &#x201C;It would be much better for everyone involved if you would be our guest until he arrives and clears things up.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And if I refuse?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You cannot.&#x201D; The reply comes from the younger Hei, now standing behind you &#x2013; low, like the rumbling of thunder. The older Hei continues, &#x201C;It could mean our heads if it was discovered we just let you walk out of here. If that is the case, I would rather take my chances with subduing you here and now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You make a good case,&#x201D; you sigh. &#x201C;How long is it until he arrives?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Tomorrow night.&#x201D; He does not seem to be lying about this, though it would be to your advantage if the real Imperial agent arrived even later.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And my companions?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They can stay here if they wish, or go back to the city. I am sure they will not be leaving Xiangyang soon, in any case,&#x201D; smiles Hei Zuolong thinly. You weigh your chances of escaping, and fighting your way out: it still does not seem any better than it was the last time you considered this issue; in fact, the odds are probably tilted against you even further now. It looks like you now have no choice but to stay and wait for an opening to escape.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But, dear, you can&#x2019;t expect me to leave you here,&#x201D; trills Yunzi falsely upon hearing your explanation. She leans in close to your ear and hisses, &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t be sent away just like that. I&#x2019;m not yours to order around.&#x201D; It looks like you won&#x2019;t be able to get rid of her right now. Xiahou Yu, on the other hand, only responds calmly and agrees to leave. &#x201C;Watch out for their people,&#x201D; you whisper. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. We&#x2019;ll see each other soon,&#x201D; replies the scholar. You notice that the umbrella is no longer with him; he may have something planned.<br>
<br>
After you bid the scholar farewell, you are led to a guest room, located on the upper floor of the main building. &#x201C;Are you not going to take my weapons?&#x201D; you ask Hei Youlong, towering over you as he plays the guide. &#x201C;What for?&#x201D; he laughs. &#x201C;You <i>are </i>a guest here, as my brother said. Besides, no amount of blades you carry will help you against the entire fortress.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D; You bow your head in gratitude.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait a minute,&#x201D; says Yunzi. &#x201C;We are sharing a room?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Youlong raises one bushy eyebrow. &#x201C;Is there a problem? I thought the two of you were-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;N-no, of course not!&#x201D; You jump in quickly to correct the misunderstanding. &#x201C;What my beloved means is that she couldn&#x2019;t believe that you are so kind as to keep us together instead of separating us!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. That is what I meant,&#x201D; says your apparent beloved awkwardly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, is that so?&#x201D; shrugs the large man. &#x201C;No thanks needed. Well, if you will excuse me, I must be off. I have drills to oversee.&#x201D; Without any exchanging any further pleasantries, he stalks off, his heavy footsteps resounding across the wooden floorboards.<br>
<br>
You enter the room with a disgruntled Yunzi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let me make this clear-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;-if you do anything stupid-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;-I&#x2019;ll throw you out of the window,&#x201D; the both of you say at the same time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;m glad we&#x2019;re in agreement on that part,&#x201D; you say, and she nods.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So the Eight Sects have something to do with the attack at Wufushan?&#x201D; murmurs Yunzi as she goes over what you have learnt. &#x201C;Some man called Mao Sanjiao appears to be involved. Have you heard of him?&#x201D; you ask, but she shakes her head. &#x201C;No. Actually, this is the first time I&#x2019;ve been in the Central Plains&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, you find yourself wondering just what happened after you left the Ashina. You are about to ask her when there is a knock on the door. A young slave girl introduces her presence; she is bringing dinner. You let her in, noticing that she looks Han. As the girl meekly sets the plates, you begin talking to her. &#x201C;So, where are you from?&#x201D; She looks down at the floor, answering in a quiet voice. &#x201C;Jiangku Village, m&#x2019;lord, by the sea to the south.&#x201D; You give her a reassuring nod. &#x201C;How did you end up here anyway?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; She gives a nervous look at the door, then at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; says Yunzi. &#x201C;This man may be a dangerous lecher, but he won&#x2019;t tell on you to your masters.&#x201D; The slave girl looks at her worriedly and takes a deep breath before responding. &#x201C;I was taken while out gathering herbs. They&#x2026;&#x201D; She does not seem able to finish, as tears well up in her eyes. Instinctively, you get up and wipe her tears away gently. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that,&#x201D; you say softly. &#x201C;But you have been a strong girl to make it through so far, haven&#x2019;t you? You&#x2019;ll be alright.&#x201D; She nods, her face turning red. &#x201C;T-thank you, m&#x2019;lord. You are too kind.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As the slave girl leaves, she casts you one last glance, smiling shyly as she closes the door behind her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Huh.&#x201D; Yunzi grunts. &#x201C;What was that all about? Ooh, you&#x2019;ve been a strong girl. Ooh, let me wipe away your tears. You are truly a pervert, through and through.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s called being kind,&#x201D; you retort. &#x201C;Besides, I was suspicious about the slaves they had. Slavery is only legal when it is done to foreigners, criminals and traitors.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a foreigner,&#x201D; she points out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, which means I&#x2019;m well within my rights to make you my slave,&#x201D; you reply casually.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ha, as if you could. We both know who&#x2019;s likely to be the slave here, <i>dog</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Anyway,&#x201D; you glare at her, attempting to get the conversation back on track before the two of you enter yet another lengthy derailment, &#x201C;it looks like they have been kidnapping Han commoners and enslaving them. That is <i>highly </i>illegal, and punishable by death.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why haven&#x2019;t they been caught then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;At first glance I would say that the prefect of Xiangyang is closing one eye to their activities,&#x201D; you explain, &#x201C;but perhaps there are more hands working behind the scenes. Still, if we publicize this, either the government or the sects would have no choice but to act. It is not something that can be done in the blink of an eye, though I wonder if there is anything I can do about this&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem rather concerned about the slaves,&#x201D; says Yunzi, glancing at you with a strange look in her eyes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I <i>was</i>, for all intents and purposes, a slave. Bought by the Emperor and placed in his son&#x2019;s hands, my life was no longer my own from that moment onwards. I do not regret it one bit, of course, but having Shun as my master made me realize that I had it lucky in comparison to the other slaves. Even a slave deserves a good master. These Black Dragons are not, and I doubt their clientele are any better.&#x201D; You sigh. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure where I&#x2019;m going with this. Forget it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi giggles lightly in response, her clear laughter suddenly reminding you of that rainy night in the Ashina camp. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t expect to hear those thoughtful sort of words from you. I <i>almost </i>see you in a new light.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There is another rap at the door. Is it the slave girl again?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Mistress? Mistress?&#x201D; calls out a nervous voice, repeating herself. &#x201C;Are you there? It&#x2019;s me, Xiaoqi.&#x201D; It is a girl, but not the slave that had brought your dinner. Yunzi narrows her eyes, suspicious. The both of you get up quietly and pad towards the door. With a sudden movement, she throws the door open and you pull the newcomer inside, holding her firmly by the wrist. Yunzi closes the door just as quickly as the girl stares at you in fright. She is young, perhaps of Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s age, and possessed of a wide-eyed innocence that induces strong feelings of protection in certain types of men.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re not my mistress,&#x201D; she murmurs. &#x201C;Wait, I know your face! You&#x2019;re-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He&#x2019;s the pervert Man Tiger Pig,&#x201D; explains Yunzi seriously. &#x201C;Be careful, girl. He&#x2019;s so perverted that if he touches you, you will become pregnant.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t work like that!&#x201D; you retort exasperatedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-I don&#x2019;t want to be impregnated!&#x201D; cries the girl as you let her go. She sinks to her knees, sobbing as she touches her belly. &#x201C;I-Is it too late?&#x201D; You grit your teeth &#x2013; you have an idea who she is. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve seen me before, right? Was it in Luoyang?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The girl stares at you defiantly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d rather die before being impregnated by a man!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You can <i>only </i>get impregnated by a man in the first place &#x2013; you almost shout out, but restrain yourself. Yunzi is looking away, feigning innocence. &#x201C;Come on, help me out here,&#x201D; you sigh. &#x201C;<i>Please</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, if you insist,&#x201D; she says smugly, and kneels down in front of the younger girl. &#x201C;Xiaoqi, was it? If you don&#x2019;t answer my questions, I&#x2019;ll get him to touch you all over. Aaaall over, from your pretty hair to your tiny toes. You&#x2019;ll be pregnant with twins, maybe <i>triplets</i>.&#x201D; She begins whimpering in terror. Yunzi smiles &#x2013; sadistically, you think &#x2013; before asking, &#x201C;Who is your Mistress? Is it Liu Chanfeng?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-yes, it is. Do you know her? I thought she would be here, some wandering scholar told me that she would be in the guest rooms.&#x201D; She must have met Xiahou Yu somehow. You do wonder what your friend is planning. &#x201C;If she isn&#x2019;t here&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiaoqi&#x2019;s face drops in despair. &#x201C;The dungeons, then? That&#x2019;s a bit hard to get to&#x2026; I knew I shouldn&apos;t have trusted a man! Oh, Mistress, I have failed your teachings!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Second question,&#x201D; continues Yunzi. &#x201C;Do you belong to the Wunan Sect? How did you get in here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xiaoqi nods her head. Before she can offer any further explanation, however, there is <i>yet </i>another knock at the door. &#x201C;Xu Jing, are you there?&#x201D; It&#x2019;s Hei Zuolong.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hide!&#x201D; you hiss. The frightened girl is shoved under the bed unceremoniously by Yunzi, who then swiftly drapes a blanket over the gap.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing?&#x201D; he asks again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just a minute!&#x201D; you shout out. You walk to the door and open it. The weasel-like man is standing there, grinning. &#x201C;I am sorry, but I heard the screams,&#x201D; he leers unapologetically. &#x201C;Far be it for me to intrude on your personal time with your wife, but I have to bring you some good news. Your colleague is already here. It was a surprise to me too, but he arrived early.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; you say. This might make things harder.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is so,&#x201D; says a smooth voice. A young, delicate looking man steps out of the darkness, dressed in dark blue finery. &#x201C;I will speak with this man alone, Zuolong.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The master of the Black Dragon Society lowers his head slightly in response. &#x201C;As you wish.&#x201D; Casting you a suspicious glance, he retreats without a further word, keen to get away from this agent of the court. The young man looks at you, then at the room. &#x201C;May I come in?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course,&#x201D; you reply. &#x201C;Go ahead.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He does so, stepping in elegantly with his hands folded behind his back. You get a whiff of a sweet perfume as he passes by you &#x2013; it smells familiar. In the well-lit room, you realize that the man is more of a boy; he looks about your age. He looks at Yunzi, then at you. &#x201C;Well well, this is interesting,&#x201D; he smiles. It is the smile of a viper, poisonous and threatening. &#x201C;The Holy Maiden of the Fire Cult is travelling with the disciple of Zhang Jue. This is unexpected.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi takes a stance, scowling at the Imperial agent. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; you warn, your hand stretching out. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t.&#x201D; There is something about the guy that makes your hair stand on end. Though his posture is casual, you get the feeling that he is always ready to strike. This man is a dangerous killer &#x2013; she would be putting herself at too much risk if she started a fight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A smart decision,&#x201D; he murmurs, still with that smile playing about his lips. His gaze is penetrating and deep; it makes you feel like a rat confronted with a hypnotic snake. &#x201C;Now, we all know that you aren&#x2019;t really a member of the secret police, Xu Jing, so do not waste our time with any attempts to claim otherwise.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t going to,&#x201D; you say, although you <i>were </i>going to try.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Where did you get that crest, I wonder?&#x201D; he muses, &#x201C;No matter. I will investigate that later. You probably waylaid one of our men and killed him before picking it up anyway. No, what really interests me is that you recognized it for what it is, when by all rights some uncouth fist-fighter wouldn&#x2019;t and would probably just pawn it off for money. In fact, you knew enough about it to impersonate a member of the secret police convincingly enough that Hei Zuolong was almost taken in&#x2026; Just <i>who </i>are you, Xu Jing?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;An unabashed man-lover,&#x201D; says Yunzi before you can reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I thought I was a pervert!&#x201D; you exclaim in surprise.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, so you admit that you are a pervert?&#x201D; she asks, cocking her head to one side in a mocking manner.<br>
<br>
The Imperial agent laughs. It looks like your exchange with Yunzi hasn&#x2019;t lowered his guard any. &#x201C;You two are <i>so</i> entertaining. Now, let&#x2019;s be serious. I will not be distracted. You know too much about us to be some normal pugilist, Xu Jing. I am certain you are not a member of the secret police, or any agent of the court.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How can you be so sure?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have my ways,&#x201D; he chuckles confidently. &#x201C;You know, your name <i>does</i> sound familiar. Perhaps-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Speaking of names,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;you haven&#x2019;t given me yours. Wait, it&#x2019;s alright. No need to tell me. I think I can guess.&#x201D; You sniff the air again, and look at his features. There&#x2019;s no mistake about it. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re called Ball-less, right?&#x201D; This agent is an eunuch. You&#x2019;ve spent enough time around them to tell.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is an apt description,&#x201D; he says, still calm and smiling despite your crude provocation, &#x201C;but that is not my name. I am Gao Ying.&#x201D; You have never heard of him before, though his age means that he is your peer. You have no doubt that he was trained to kill just as you were, though. Gao Ying shakes his head gently. &#x201C;Anyway, that does not matter. I have made my conclusion. You are a dangerous man, Xu Jing. Your prowess and cunning combined with your knowledge of the court&#x2019;s internal apparatus makes you a threat to the security of the empire.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is a pretty big conclusion to jump to, my friend without balls,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;For someone of your caliber, there are only two paths you can take,&#x201D; replies the eunuch. &#x201C;Friend or foe of the empire. Tonight I will decide which you are-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve had enough! I can&#x2019;t breathe!&#x201D; shouts Xiaoqi from under the bed, surprising everyone. A small round ball rolls out from her hiding place and begins spewing choking smoke everywhere &#x2013; the lass brought along a smoke bomb. Good for her. Gao Ying begins coughing, holding up his sleeve to his nose.<br>
<br>
There is a loud crash as the wooden window frame is shattered. You hear a loud commotion from outside &#x2013; it cannot be because of what just happened in the room as the noise appears to be coming from far away. Perhaps Yu has started something? A shadowy figure &#x2013; Xiaoqi &#x2013; darts past you in the smoke and leaps out the window. &#x201C;Come on, Jing!&#x201D; shouts Yunzi as she follows the girl. You begin to move, but the eunuch shouts out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait! A man of your talents is wasted wandering the land like this! The times are changing. With your strength and smarts you could play a vital role in renewing this country! I said that I wanted to determine whether you are friend or foe &#x2013; now I am asking you this: my prince has great need for talent like you. Will you join us?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You pause in your steps. You know you should be fleeing through the window right now, but you cannot help but ask. &#x201C;Which prince?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Through the smoke you can faintly see the silhouette of Gao Ying, but you have the feeling that he is staring right at you, seeing you clearly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, you know enough of the Imperial family that you would take an interest in which prince I serve. Another reason that I must decide your allegiance here,&#x201D; he says amusedly. &#x201C;Of course, I serve the only prince that matters, the only person that is worthy. The Crown Prince Li Shun.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Could he be lying? You do not know. You have been away from the palace for far too long, but when you left this Gao Ying had never been part of Shun&#x2019;s entourage. Of course, many things can change in three years&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You blow off his offer with a snarky response and leap out of the window. Best make your escape while the smoke still helps to obscure you.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You reject his offer and flee, but mention that you also serve the Crown Prince; you get the feeling that if this man regards you a foe, you will have made a terrible enemy.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You give in. This is a chance to get back into the palace circles and meet Shun again. And on the off-chance that he is lying for some reason, you might be able to turn this into an opportunity to spy on one of Shun&#x2019;s enemies and help him from within.

            <h3>四十五 · Icy Heart</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Icy Heart</span></b><br>
<br>
You decide to throw the eunuch a bone. &#x201C;What a coincidence. I&#x2019;m also here on Shun&#x2019;s orders.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is what I would expect you to say,&#x201D; replies Gao Ying confidently. &#x201C;If you think that can fool me-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My name is familiar, isn&#x2019;t it? Think. When did you start serving at the palace?&#x201D; You begin inching towards the window.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Eight years ago, but&#x2026; do you mean-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Exactly.&#x201D; With a grin, you leap through the window.  &#x201C;Wait!&#x201D; shouts Gao Ying. As you clear the sill, something small zips past your ear, vanishing into the darkness. You land clumsily &#x2013; the fall is not high, but you are in no condition to perform any acrobatics &#x2013; and spring to your feet quickly before the eunuch can give chase. Yunzi is in front of you waving agitatedly. &#x201C;What took you so long, you turtle?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Go, go!&#x201D; you shout, sprinting towards her. She stretches out her hand; you grab it, realizing that you can&#x2019;t make it over the wall alone. With her help, you clear the fortifications safely. You run for the protection of the trees the moment you land on the other side. With any luck, they will not find your trail.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Three years ago there was an attack on the Ashina tribe that you participated in. You were planning to assassinate the Crown Prince Li Shun. Who ordered it and why?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As expected, Xiahou Yu had successfully freed Liu Chanfeng and met up with you in the woods. The five of you, including Liu&#x2019;s apprentice, had put a fair amount of distance between yourselves and the fortress before being forced to stop and rest; the night was not getting any younger, and to continue moving would only worsen everyone&#x2019;s fatigued condition. You decided to take that chance to question the woman you had come here for.<br>
<br>
Liu Chanfeng glares at you while Xiahou Yu watches on, his face impassive. Though she seemed frail from her imprisonment, her cold and sharp demeanour was as intimidating as you remembered, and her beauty undiminished even by the mark on her face. Then, she lets out a mad laugh. &#x201C;You came all the way here and freed me to ask me this? Men are so foolish. I will tell you if you desire to know that much&#x2026; I certainly do not owe them anything but hatred. I received my mission from the Hei brothers of the Black Dragon Society&#x2026; that was back when I was still useful to them. Take it up with them if you want to know who gave them the orders, though it was probably either the Lady Wu or Grand Eunuch Li. The older one was there that night, gathering riders from another tribe. The mission was to take the Crown Prince into custody, not kill him. Why did we elect to do it all the way out in Tujue territory, involving the Ashina? I do not know. Figure it out yourself. There. That is all I have for you.&#x201D;  She says nothing more, turning her gaze up into the sky.<br>
<br>
Liu Chanfeng seems to be telling the truth. You turn away from her and stare frustratedly in the direction of the fortress. There is no way you will be able to approach the Hei brothers for a while &#x2013; it looks like you would have to pay them another visit at a later time. Perhaps if you had not shown your hand so early&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a hail of arrows flies out of the dark, without warning.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They&#x2019;ve found us!&#x201D; shouts Xiaoqi, jumping up in a panic. In your eagerness to interrogate Liu Chanfeng, you had failed to detect the approach of your pursuers. Xiaoqi hurls her round smoke pellets towards the direction of the arrows to cover your escape. Surprisingly, Xiahou Yu scoops up a protesting Liu Chanfeng in his arms in a decisive manner and bounds away at high speed. He might not be a good fighter, but you realize that his <i>qinggong </i>is at a superb level, probably a lot better than yours. As you turn to retreat, a stray projectile flies at you out from the smoke. You instinctively flinch away &#x2013; that is all that saves you from having an arrow through your head.<br>
<br>
Your left eye, however, is not so lucky.<br>
<br>
A blinding pain assails the left side of your head as the sharp tip of the arrow skims across your eyeball. You resist the urge to scream out, biting on your lip as you clutch your burning eye. Warm, sticky blood is oozing from between your fingers. Stumbling off, you wave away Yunzi, who seems alarmed at your injury. &#x201C;Run, go! We have to shake them off again!&#x201D; The Black Dragon Society appears to have some good trackers amongst their men &#x2013; just your luck.<br>
<br>
Making a clucking noise of dissatisfaction, she turns and flees. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t fall behind,&#x201D; she calls out.<br>
<br>
You run until you catch up to Xiaoqi, who yelps when you grab her by the collar. &#x201C;One of your smoke bombs. Quickly!&#x201D; She looks confused until you plunge your hand down her robes, searching around for what you want. Xiaoqi leaps back with a girlish yelp but you have already gotten what you need. You give her a gentle kick to the rear, urging her to catch up with the others.<br>
<br>
There is no way about it. If you are to stop their pursuit, you must find a way to turn the tables on them. Sighing, you run behind a large tree before quietly clambering up it. Though you cannot see out of your left eye right now, your other senses still work. Calming yourself, you keep your ears open.<br>
<br>
How many are there?<br>
<br>
Six? Nine? No, more than twelve men. Skilled fighters &#x2013; it would not be a good idea to confront them head-on. You listen to the sound of leaves and twigs being crunched underfoot.<br>
<br>
Two of the men walk with quieter steps.<br>
<br>
They are probably the trackers. You place the round, chemical-filled container between your teeth, holding it gently so that you don&#x2019;t break it. Then, you slowly draw your wodao and the Yuchang Sword, a weapon in each hand.<br>
<br>
They would be passing beneath you soon  - in this darkness, with your injured eye, your sight is almost useless. You would just have to rely on your other senses and your instinct.<br>
<br>
The trackers would be at the front of the pack. Keeping a low profile, your silhouette melds with the branches and the leaves. They would see you if they knew where to find you, but it seems that they are not thinking of looking up. They pause below the tree, looking at the obvious tracks you made on purpose.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Strange,&#x201D; you hear one of them say, &#x201C;one of these tracks leads away-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
You do not give him the chance to finish. Dropping down from the branches, you cut him down with the wodao &#x2013; the keen blade splits him from collarbone to his last rib. You attempt to stab at the other tracker, but he deflects the Yuchang Sword with a  lucky parry despite his panic. The mercenaries shout out at the sight of you.<br>
<br>
This is as far as you go; staying here would be the death of you. You would just have to satisfy yourself with the death of one tracker and scaring them. You laugh maniacally. &#x201C;Come after me and one of you will be next!&#x201D; Dropping the smoke bomb, you stamp on it, hard. It erupts into a large plume of obscuring smoke, and you flee without looking back.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Your gambit worked; their pursuit slowed down though it did not cease. You rejoin the others at a small cabin south of the fortress, near Shennong Forest; Xiahou Yu had pointed out the gathering location should any of you had gotten lost. Finally you could rest.<br>
<br>
With the dawn, however, came new problems. After bandaging your eye &#x2013; you step out into the cheerful, sunny open only to find Yu and Chanfeng arguing. Before he can react, she strikes at him with her fingers. The scholar freezes in position, and you start to move towards them, wondering if she is planning on harming your friend.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop right there,&#x201D; she snarls. &#x201C;Are you going to stop me from leaving too?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;Why? Yu has gone through so much to find you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is <i>his </i>business,&#x201D; replies Liu Chanfeng. &#x201C;I did not ask him to come find me. I am&#x2026; thankful that am I now free, but I cannot tarry here. I have to free my sect sisters&#x2026; Xiaoqi&#x2019;s friends, before they are sold into slavery.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are going back to the Black Dragon Society? That is insane,&#x201D; you exclaim. &#x201C;No wonder Yu did not want to let you go.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They do not sell the slaves here - they will drug them, disguise them as foreigners and transport them up north, to a place called Youxia City. I just have to strike there.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You shake your head. Though Yu is frozen, you can see the pleading look in his eyes. You have no doubt that once he is freed he will attempt to follow her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are you going to do? Make me submit by force, like the brutish male that you are?&#x201D; sneers Liu Chanfeng. You scratch gently at the bandage around your left eye &#x2013; it still hurts you terribly. From what you have heard, Liu Chanfeng is not in the best shape from her imprisonment, but right now neither are you.<br>
<br>
Yunzi and Xiaoqi exit the cabin. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on, mistress?&#x201D; asks Xiaoqi as she trots over to Chanfeng. &#x201C;We are leaving,&#x201D; replies her mistress curtly. &#x201C;Are your things packed?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;B-but Sister Yunzi promised to teach me some moves!&#x201D; complains the girl.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on, Jing?&#x201D; asks Yunzi as she comes to your side. You look at her, then at Xiahou Yu, and finally at Liu Chanfeng.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You ask Yunzi to help you subdue Liu Chanfeng. You are really in no condition for any duels right now, though you are only doing this for Xiahou Yu&#x2019;s sake.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You let her go on her way, and attempt to convince Xiahou Yu to not go after her once he is unfrozen. You are not sure if he will listen, though.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You offer to go with her. Youxia City sounds like a fun place, and if it&#x2019;s to free her sisters from slavery it is for a good cause.

            <h3>四十六 · Encounter on the Road</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Encounter on the Road</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Go get her!&#x201D; you say, pointing at Liu Chanfeng.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What?&#x201D; frowns Yunzi. She looks at you as if you are mad. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s trying to run off! No time to explain, just subdue her!&#x201D; you say. Yunzi gives you a pitying look, but runs towards Chanfeng anyway. Recognizing her hostile intent, Chanfeng immediately takes a stance and meets Yunzi head on. The two women begin their fight while you look on. Chanfeng&#x2019;s poor condition has her hard-pressed to find a response to Yunzi&#x2019;s swift attacks, but somehow she manages to dodge the strikes by the skin of her teeth. This would be a much more equal match if she had not just escaped from imprisonment. As they continue exchanging blows, you move towards Xiahou Yu to free him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xiaoqi, help us escape! Quickly!&#x201D; shouts Liu Chanfeng suddenly, realizing that she cannot hold out much longer.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-yes, Mistress!&#x201D; shouts her faithful disciple. The girl runs towards the fight and places one hand in her robes &#x2013; she must be looking for yet another of her trademark smoke bombs. If she pulls it off Liu Chanfeng will have the opportunity to escape. This takes priority. Turning away from Yu, you sprint towards Xiaoqi&#x2019;s back just as she passes you. Taking advantage while her guard is lowered, you scoop her up from behind and sling her slight body over your shoulder as she screams in fright.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let me down!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Haha, no!&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;Just sit quietly and watch. A lady shouldn&#x2019;t interfere in a proper duel.&#x201D; You carry the struggling girl away from the fight. &#x201C;No! I&#x2019;m going to be defiled!&#x201D; She doesn&#x2019;t seem to be listening to you. Crying out in panic, she slaps you on the back.<br>
<br>
It hurts more than you would expect. In fact, it feels exactly like she just used the Yuhua Duqing Palm on you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, sh-&#x201C; You feel the familiar thorny <i>qi</i> digging its excruciating way into your body. It looks like you underestimated her. You drop Xiaoqi as you sink to your knees, your internal wounds reopening painfully. Coughing up blood, you fall flat on your back, staring up at the sky. It is a very clear sky. You feel like you could get lost in that blue expanse&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Uh oh, did I kill him?&#x201D; mutters Xiaoqi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No,&#x201D; you manage to grunt out, fixing your eyes on her. She leaps back with a yelp. You try to get up, but find that you are unable to even twitch a finger. This might be bad. Xiaoqi looks at you warily and attempts to turn away, but she is stopped by a hand on her shoulder. It&#x2019;s Yunzi. Xiaoqi freezes up like a little herbivorous animal.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, did you get her?&#x201D; you ask, looking up at her from your comfortable spot on the ground.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t get her&#x2026; she fainted by herself,&#x201D; shrugs Yunzi as she gestures behind her. Craning your neck with tremendous effort, you can just about make out Liu Chanfeng collapsed on the ground, though with more elegance than your own posture. &#x201C;She overexerted herself trying to keep up with me,&#x201D; continues Yunzi. &#x201C;Not a very satisfying match, really. She wasn&#x2019;t in good condition. What&#x2019;s the matter with you anyway?&#x201D; She looks over you, turning her head to the side. Then, she looks at Xiaoqi. &#x201C;Wait, no, no need to tell me. You tried to molest Xiaoqi and she fought back? Was asking me to go after Liu Chanfeng just a ruse so that you could abduct an innocent girl?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s <i>exactly</i> right, big sister,&#x201D; says Xiaoqi with conviction, somehow having found her courage back. &#x201C;I managed to take down this beast in man&#x2019;s clothing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you keep saying that, one of these days I&#x2019;ll <i>really</i> do it. Look,&#x201D; you sigh, &#x201C;Just go undo Xiahou Yu&#x2019;s immobilization, then find something to bind Liu Chanfeng. We need to talk.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you again for stopping her,&#x201D; says Xiahou Yu gratefully. &#x201C;In her condition she should not be rushing anywhere, let alone after Black Dragon Society mercenaries.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not me you have to thank. Yunzi was the one that did most of the work.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be so modest, Jing. It was your idea.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How did you convince her anyway?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m shocked that she stayed after that.&#x201D; Attempting to reason it out with Chanfeng had been useless in the aftermath of the fight. Suddenly Yu had told everyone to leave him and Chanfeng alone for some time so that he could persuade her. He had gotten a small jar of wine from somewhere too. You wonder if that factored in the persuasion. Surprisingly, Liu Chanfeng had agreed to accompany your group as far as Emei the next morning. She seemed reluctant to do so, but whatever Yu said, it seemed to have convinced her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She&#x2019;s not an unreasonable woman,&#x201D; says Yu calmly, as if the argument had never happened.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Only you would think and say something like that about that woman,&#x201D; you reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ha, maybe,&#x201D; laughs Xiahou Yu cheerfully. &#x201C;Now, finish up the food.&#x201D; Yunzi had categorically refused to take care of you, Xiaoqi wouldn&#x2019;t come near you, and Liu Chanfeng would probably rather die than feed a man, and so the job of being your caretaker while you were paralyzed fell to him. He lifts the spoon to your mouth, but the sudden shaking of the wagon spills the thin gruel.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Riders in the distance!&#x201D; shouts Yunzi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Black Dragon Society might have caught up,&#x201D; says Xiahou Yu worriedly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll go take a look.&#x201D; Due to your unfortunate affliction they had been forced to procure a wagon to transport you. It was not surprising that the Black Dragon Society would be able to follow your trail like this, though you had hoped they would have given up once you exited the Xiangyang region.<br>
<br>
No such luck, you suppose.<br>
<br>
Resting on the bed, you keep your ears open and your breathing steady, listening to the happenings outside. You hear the hooves of horses striking the ground, though there are too many for you to keep an exact count. Perhaps twenty to thirty. They seem to be approaching from different directions&#x2026; there are two groups. There are shouts, and a brief scuffle with weapons drawn. Then, you hear one group breaking away, their sound of their horses receding further and further from you. Some muffled conversation begins to take place outside the wagon.<br>
<br>
After a while, Xiahou Yu climbs back in, followed by a cheery, cute girl with short hair.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good day,&#x201D; she grins, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry to interrupt while you are in your convalescence, but it would be remiss of me not to introduce myself to a fellow traveller on the road.&#x201D; Even though her words are formal and polite, she gives off an affable air.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is Miss Song Lingshu, the head of the Qingcheng Sect,&#x201D; introduces Xiahou Yu. &#x201C;She and a band of Qingcheng disciples scared off the bandits just now. I thought you would like to thank her personally, brother.&#x201D; You try not to let the surprise show on your face. This is not what you expected Song Lingshu to look like. &#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m grateful, Miss Song,&#x201D; you stammer. &#x201C;I have long heard of your name and the fame of your sect. To think we would be saved by such a great person&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, don&#x2019;t start with that,&#x201D; laughs Song Lingshu. &#x201C;I am not one for exaggerated talk. It was nothing, I was just following the principles of justice that my dear father taught me &#x2013; to help the people wherever I go.&#x201D; Strange, that is not what you know of him. Song Jiangke probably did not practice what he preached. &#x201C;Your father must be a truly admirable man then,&#x201D; you say. She does not seem to catch the hint of sarcasm in your voice; a look of sorrow crosses over the girl&#x2019;s face. &#x201C;Yes, he was&#x2026; but he is no longer with us now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; see,&#x201D; you say carefully. &#x201C;I am sorry to hear that. It must be a great loss to you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, it falls to me to uphold his legacy now, and continue the fight for justice. One cannot mourn forever,&#x201D; she replies, smiling brilliantly. It looks like her optimism and cheerfulness cannot be suppressed for long.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What brings you all the way out here anyway?&#x201D; you ask. She had not participated at the youth tournament, having had to stay in mourning over her father&#x2019;s death. The girl explains in a carefree manner, &#x201C;You see, I just took over as head of the sect. I thought I would travel to Wudang to pay my respects to the Grand Taoist Wang Zhengchong. He is the leader of the pugilistic world, and as a young leader it is my duty to pay obeisance to my elders. I was just coming back from there.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did you manage to meet him?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No,&#x201D; she sighs, her shoulders drooping. Here is a person that clearly wears her emotions on her sleeve. &#x201C;He is in seclusion. I did manage to speak to some other old guy &#x2013; &#x201C; Suddenly she turns red as she apologizes. &#x201C;Sorry, I misspoke! I mean, the acting head, Master Daoshi! I&#x2019;m sorry. My father used to try and teach me proper etiquette, but it has been quite difficult for me to keep to those lessons all the time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If he is old and a man, then you did not speak falsely,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I am sure Wudang&#x2019;s masters wouldn&#x2019;t go so far as to deny their own age and gender.&#x201D; Song Lingshu laughs brightly. &#x201C;You are an interesting person&#x2026; you remind me of Huashan&#x2019;s Young Master Bai.&#x201D; You try your hardest not to make a face of loathing at the sound of Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s name. How in the world do you remind her of that guy?<br>
<br>
The Qingcheng head continues, &#x201C;I have heard that you are headed to Chengdu. Would you like me and my fellow Qingcheng disciples to escort you there? I think it would be safer. The roads are rife with bandits nowadays.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, no, we couldn&#x2019;t possibly ask you to do that,&#x201D; you say humbly. &#x201C;As the leader of a great orthodox sect, I am sure you are busy enough that you would not want to be slowed down by us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We are headed in the same direction anyway. So, what do you think? Wait, I haven&#x2019;t got your name, have I?&#x201D; She gives you that cheerful grin again. You glance over her shoulder, at Xiahou Yu. He nods &#x2013; he is agreeable to it. The decision is yours to make, however.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You accept the escort offer. The roads are dangerous, that much is true, and in your current defenseless state any extra assistance, even from an orthodox sect, would be helpful.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You reject the escort offer. Though she may have good intentions now, you do not know if she will remain the same if she knows your true identity, or that of Chanfeng&apos;s, who has a bit of notoriety of her own.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You reveal your identity as Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple up front. You would prefer to be truthful rather than for her to find out later; you do not want to start off this acquaintanceship with a lie. It can be left up to her whether she wants to escort you or not then.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You do not reveal your identity. It is probably wiser to just pretend to be some sick boy seeking treatment; as Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple you <i>are </i>disliked by most of the orthodox fraternity. If she knows of your connection to Master Yao, things might be even worse.

            <h3>四十七 · Return to Emei</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Return to Emei</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I really do appreciate the offer, but before that there is something you must know.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is that?&#x201D; says Song Lingshu, smiling. Your demeanour changes, a cocky grin spreading across your face. &#x201C;Are you sure it is okay for the head of Qingcheng to be helping Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple?&#x201D; She laughs loudly and turns to Xiahou Yu. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a good joke! You didn&#x2019;t tell me your brother is such a prankster&#x2026; is he?&#x201D; Her expression becomes doubtful as she sees Xiahou Yu looking rather disgruntled.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wish it was. I am the Man Tiger Pig.&#x201D; You confess your identity, giving her a serious look. Song Lingshu&#x2019;s laugh fades as she glances awkwardly at you. &#x201C;Seriously? I mean, I don&#x2019;t really understand why anyone would lie about that, but&#x2026; oh, this is just weird.&#x201D; She scratches her head, frowning. You notice that her manner of speech has become decidedly more boyish and informal as she gets more perplexed. &#x201C;Are you really <i>that </i>guy?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The one and only, though as you can see I&#x2019;m in a bit of a tight spot at the moment.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you are really him, it would be bad for me to help you. I mean, you&#x2019;re the disciple of the Southern Maniac and everything! My reputation would be ruined! Ah, this is so confusing!&#x201D; she groans.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s so confusing?&#x201D; you ask, starting to get confused yourself.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, you&#x2019;re clearly injured, and in need of help. If I didn&#x2019;t help you I really couldn&#x2019;t live with myself, but if you are the Man Tiger Pig I shouldn&#x2019;t be helping you...&#x201D; Her voice trails off and you can almost see the gears working behind her head. &#x201C;Forget it,&#x201D; she says finally.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If that is how it is, I understand. &#x201D; You knew that there was a likely chance she would refuse to help if she knew your true identity. &#x201C;You would get into trouble with the other orthodox sects if they found out, after all.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, that&#x2019;s not it.&#x201D; Song Lingshu shakes her head. &#x201C;I mean, I&#x2019;m not going to think about it too much anymore. You&#x2019;re injured and I&#x2019;m going to escort you. There&#x2019;s no need to consider anything else. Whether you are really Man Tiger Pig or not doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure?&#x201D; You are mildly surprised at her decision.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course! I help because I want to do what is right, not because of what people are called. I promised to help you before I knew who you were, and that was because I sensed you are a good guy. Even if you are the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s disciple, nothing has changed from five minutes ago. I&#x2019;m pretty sure you&#x2019;re the sort of guy who&#x2019;s kind at heart,&#x201D; declares the girl confidently. Something about what she said sounds familiar&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm, if that&#x2019;s the case, I graciously accept your offer. I&#x2019;m in your debt,&#x201D; you say. If she&#x2019;s willing, you have nothing against it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No need for thanks,&#x201D; smiles Song Lingshu. &#x201C;Now, we should probably get going. I&#x2019;ll drop by later to chat. I know it&#x2019;s wrong of me to say this as head of Qingcheng, but you just won&#x2019;t believe how boring the disciples are sometimes. See you soon!&#x201D; She ducks out of the wagon as quickly as she came, leaving you and Xiahou Yu behind.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She&#x2019;s a chatty one, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201D; you remark. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe you actually told her your true identity,&#x201D; sighs Yu, his shoulders sagging. &#x201C;For that matter, I can&#x2019;t believe it worked!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was a gamble,&#x201D; you admit. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know how she would react, though I <i>was</i> hoping that she was one of those genuinely optimistic people that sees the good in everyone.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean like yourself? Knowing a kindred spirit, that sort of thing?&#x201D; Yu laughs for a while before he seems to realize something. His laughter stops and his face turns sombre. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not right, is it? You aren&#x2019;t a very optimistic person,&#x201D; he says suddenly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, I&#x2019;m always thinking positive,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why I can take so many gambles.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; Yu disagrees. &#x201C;It just seems more like you don&#x2019;t care what happens to you, rather than being optimistic. Anyway, I&#x2019;ll also be riding outside for a while. Get some rest while you can.&#x201D; As he leaves the wagon, it begins to move slowly. You are on the road again.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
True to her word, Song Lingshu returns to accompany you inside the wagon, and often. It seems that she finds your company preferable to that of her own sect members. By her account, they seem to be a rather bland bunch who can only see her as the leader of Qingcheng and not as her own person. On your part, you find her rather affable and easy to talk to.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You know, I always thought your master was just some murderous nutcase that lost control by practicing unorthodox martial arts. From your stories, that doesn&#x2019;t seem to be the case.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yeah, most people think that, and I don&#x2019;t blame them. It is rare for most people to meet someone that can kill a man as if they were crushing an ant, and Master Zhang is one of them.&#x201D; You had regaled her with tales of your experience as Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple, including the time when the two of you went after some hapless pirates that had decided to raid Maniac Island, not knowing who it belonged to. &#x201C;I suppose the world is very wide, and there are different forms of justice,&#x201D; she says thoughtfully, but adds excitedly, &#x201C;I still believe in my own path as the right one, though!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Just then, Yunzi climbs into the wagon, holding a bowl in her hand. &#x201C;Hey, dinner is ready...&#x201D; She stops upon seeing Song Lingshu there. &#x201C;Ah, am I interrupting?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, not at all!&#x201D; replies Lingshu cheerfully. &#x201C;Are you here to feed him?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not,&#x201D; says Yunzi coolly as she glances at you. &#x201C;I was just bringing the dinner. This man needs to learn how to feed himself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He still seems too weak to hold the spoon.&#x201D; Lingshu turns to look at you. &#x201C;Well, I will help out with the feeding then. I used to do it for my sick mother.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do as you wish. I&#x2019;ll just leave the bowl here then.&#x201D; Placing the bowl down on the floor of the wagon, Yunzi leaves before you can say anything. Lingshu picks it up. &#x201C;You know,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;your friend Xiahou Yu initially introduced her as your wife. That doesn&#x2019;t seem to be the case.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not,&#x201D; you say calmly. &#x201C;The heavens will rain blood before I marry that shrew.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is not a nice thing to say.&#x201D; She stuffs your mouth with a spoonful of hot gruel. &#x201C;I thought you had a reputation for chasing after every girl that crosses your path?&#x201D; You swallow before replying indignantly. &#x201C;That is not true, and even if it was, I definitely wouldn&#x2019;t go after <i>that </i>girl. How about you, then? Doesn&#x2019;t the fair maiden of Qingcheng have a man in her heart?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x201D; she replies tentatively, suddenly shy despite her usual boisterous behaviour. &#x201C;There is one guy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, do tell,&#x201D; you say, grinning. &#x201C;This should be good.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right, keep it a secret from my fellows in Qingcheng,&#x201D; she whispers theatrically. &#x201C;Bai Jiutian.&#x201D; You try to keep yourself from spitting the gruel all over her face at the mention of his name. &#x201C;Seriously?&#x201D; you choke.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; she continues, mistaking your tone, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a bit silly of me, I know, but I&#x2019;ve always liked him&#x2026; A-anyway, enough of that! Let&#x2019;s talk about something else.&#x201D; You do so, thankful that she wasn&#x2019;t going to start reminiscing about how dashing Bai was.<br>
<br>
The wagon continues to travel slowly but with little incident as the days go by &#x2013; if there was any pursuit, the sight of the Qingcheng contingent seems to have kept them away. It looks like the Black Dragon Society or the secret police might not be keen to engage in open conflict with the orthodox sects for now. By the time you reach the foot of Emei Mountain, you have regained enough strength to walk, though anything more strenuous would inflict excruciating pain. You sit on the outside of the wagon, watching the others prepare for the ascend.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Young mistress, we will depart for Qingcheng first,&#x201D; says a tall, bearded man, who appears to be her right-hand disciple. &#x201C;Please return as soon as you are able.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, yes, I know,&#x201D; says Song Lingshu. &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t been to see Yifang in a while, so I&#x2019;d like to catch up with her. I&#x2019;ll see you soon, Uncle Mao.&#x201D; The man nods and turns away, leading the rest of the disciples in the direction of Qingcheng. That&#x2019;s right; Song Lingshu is Yifang&#x2019;s childhood friend. There is something else you are interested in, however &#x2013; her Uncle Mao. You have a hunch about this, and approach her. &#x201C;Uncle Mao?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;He seems rather commanding. Is he related?&#x201D; She shakes her head. &#x201C;No, he&#x2019;s just my father&#x2019;s good friend. Mao Sanjiao is one of the best men in Qingcheng. He took care of me often while I was growing up. That&#x2019;s why I call him uncle.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You only smile and nod.<br>
<br>
You <i>definitely </i>have to talk to Yu and Chanfeng about this when you get the chance.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When Song Lingshu and Yifang meet, the Qingcheng girl immediately puts her hand on the Emei nun&#x2019;s shoulder and sweeps her off, talking about justice excitedly.<br>
<br>
So <i>that&#x2019;s </i>where she really got all her fanciful notions from.<br>
<br>
Next, Xiahou Yu went for his private audience with the Abbess, together with Liu Chanfeng and Xiaoqi. He wants to arrange for a safe haven for them here, though he has confessed to you that he is going to ask Chanfeng to skip the part where she becomes a celibate nun.<br>
<br>
It is just you and Yunzi left in the visitors&#x2019; hall, and she seems slightly glum for some reason. After a while, you ask, &#x201C;Are you okay?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course. There is no need for your concern,&#x201D; comes the reply. &#x201C;I am just counting the days until I need to return to the Fire Temple. I have been away too long.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you worried about them?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She doesn&#x2019;t respond. You are undecided whether to probe further when Cao&#x2019;er finally arrives. Surprisingly, she&#x2019;s followed by Chi Qilin &#x2013; you didn&#x2019;t know that she would be here. The two of them enter the hall with a spring in their step. Upon seeing you, Cao&#x2019;er runs forward and greets you by jumping into your arms. &#x201C;Jing!&#x201D; Qilin whistles approvingly. &#x201C;My my, it looks like <i>someone </i>was really missing you, Xu Jing. Oh, naturally, I missed you too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D; You muster up a greeting though Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s embrace is squeezing the life out of you. &#x201C;I-I can&#x2019;t breathe.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;oh, sorry.&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er lets go and steps away, looking at the floor. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t look good&#x2026; help?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yeah,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to need to rest here for a while.&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s face brightens up, happy that you&#x2019;ll be staying. &#x201C;&#x2026;good&#x2026; I have new things to try&#x2026;&#x201D; Something about that worries you a little, especially since Qilin is grinning widely like she knows what is going to happen.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see you haven&#x2019;t been idle in seducing helpless young girls,&#x201D; remarks Yunzi from the side. Before you can retort, Cao&#x2019;er walks up to her. &#x201C;&#x2026;so, you are number four&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Number four? What do you mean?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Um&#x2026; I&#x2019;m first&#x2026; then there is Qilin&#x2026; my sister&#x2026; then you are number four, right? &#x2026;or did you want to be the first wife? We can negotiate&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi turns beet-red upon hearing Cao&#x2019;er mutter those words innocently.<br>
<br>
You do not want to recall the fight that came after, especially after the devious Qilin slid herself into the mix and began adding oil to the fire.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er had said that your recovery would be painfully slow, but Miecao had appeared with a small satchel; it contained precious golden fox leaves. Song Lingshu had left them with the Abbess before she left, saying that she was not sure whether to give it to you directly, but would like the Abbess &#x2013; who she thought wiser than herself &#x2013; to decide whether or not you deserved the help. &#x201C;I suppose Qingcheng would be rich enough to afford it,&#x201D; says Miecao acidly. Being a strict nunnery, Emei wasn&#x2019;t exactly swimming in money.<br>
<br>
The leaves were definitely a tremendous help; though you had needed to use every last leaf, under Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s expert and tender, if slightly dubious, care, your physical recovery was complete within a month. Your <i>neigong</i>, however, was a different matter. It was out of her expertise to heal &#x2013; you suppose you would just have to wait for it to recover on its own. After consulting with Miecao about the toad demon incident, she had instructed one of the more spiritual nuns to write you some talismans just in case there were any problems with your body. They looked somewhat different from the one the exorcist Master Zhong had given you, but hopefully they would have the same effect if required.<br>
<br>
Then, with less than three months to the Fire Cult&#x2019;s challenge, things began moving. First you received news that Luoying Manor had been burnt to the ground by the Emperor&#x2019;s troops. Lady Ji was missing, and the land had been turned into a temporary base for Tang soldiers.<br>
<br>
Shortly afterwards, even worse news came.<br>
<br>
The Emperor had been poisoned and fallen into a coma. The blame was put on Tulu Huodu of the Wudu Cult, and an army of ten thousand had been dispatched to exterminate them. Leading the army was the Crown Prince Li Shun &#x2013; as the favoured heir it seems that the court had pressured him to take personal responsibility for the attack on his father.<br>
<br>
Qilin&#x2019;s face had paled when she received the news &#x2013; this was the first time you had seen such a scared expression from her. She ran off to her room to begin packing immediately. At the same time, Yunzi decided that she would also be returning to the Fire Cult &#x2013; it seems that with the fresh troubles going on in the Central Plains, she needs to go back and see what the temple has in mind.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will be staying here for a while until Chanfeng is more stable,&#x201D; says Xiahou Yu later that night. It seems that her ordeals have left Liu Chanfeng traumatized even though she tried not to show it, and it will take a while longer in a safe environment before Yu felt she was ready to travel. In the meantime, the two of you had been asking the nuns about Mao Sanjiao of Qingcheng &#x2013; there is little you can find out about him except that he had been sworn brothers with Song Jiangke and is one of the best fighters in the Qingcheng Sect. He did not seem to recognize Liu Chanfeng on your journey here, but you cannot be sure.<br>
<br>
The Fire Cult&#x2019;s challenge is not far away now, but there are a few urgent matters you need to follow up on.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You decide to follow Yunzi back to the Fire Temple. She had said, once, that if you were curious about that organization she could bring you in for a look. She had not elaborated much on it, but you think that she might actually be a bit pleased if you went.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will follow Qilin to the Wudu Cult. Qilin seems convinced that her uncle was framed. Besides, if the army attacks it will be an extremely dangerous situation for Shun. Tulu Huodu is not one of the Five Greats for nothing, and though he may not be able to defeat an army of ten thousand, if Shun is poisoned there&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You choose to stay in Emei to recuperate and practice your martial arts in preparation for the Fire Cult challenge; you are really behind on your training. Since Qingcheng is not far away, you could also pay them a visit and see if you could find out more about Mao Sanjiao.

            <h3>四十八 · March on Guizhou</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">March on Guizhou</span></b><br>
<br>
You sniff the air. The weather is becoming cooler &#x2013; autumn is here. It had been summer when you left Maniac Island. The Fire Cult&#x2019;s challenge would take place on the winter solstice, some months away. Strange, that a group that identified itself with fire would pick the coldest time of the year. You stoke the campfire slowly. &#x201C;You know, I thought you&#x2019;d have chosen to go with the Fire Cult girl,&#x201D; says Qilin suddenly, sitting opposite you. &#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er is busy preparing some medicines, her back to you, but you notice her movements slowing down. Though she does not say anything,  she is probably listening for your answer too.<br>
<br>
You had parted ways with Yunzi back at Emei, though not without her reminding you that you owed her a rematch at the Fire Cult&#x2019;s challenge, when you would hopefully be fully healed. It was a promise you hoped to keep &#x2013; this time you&#x2019;ll finally beat it into her head that you are the superior fighter, once and for all. Then, you had chased after Qilin. &#x201C;Is it so strange that I&#x2019;d want to come here?&#x201D; you ask with a disbelieving chuckle.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. I really didn&#x2019;t think you would actually offer to accompany me,&#x201D; says Qilin seriously. Then, a small, sly grin reveals itself, and she asks teasingly, &#x201C;Or did you actually come here for <i>my</i> sake? Oh dear, have you fallen for me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ha, you can keep on dreaming about that!&#x201D; you laugh. Though that is probably not too far from the truth &#x2013; you were also here because of Shun &#x2013; you would rather die than admit that you came to help her. She would probably be even more insufferable if you admitted to caring about her wellbeing. A fleeting emotion crosses Qilin&#x2019;s face for an instant before dissolving into her familiar, mischievous look. &#x201C;Well, I was just kidding. You wouldn&#x2019;t come for my sake, I know that. It must be the Crown Prince&#x2026; I can think of no other reason.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure what you are talking about.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, come on. Remember what Lady Ji said that night at Luoying Manor? I&#x2019;m not stupid, you know. I can make some pretty good guesses. You had a noble&#x2019;s education, you came from the palace, and you chose to came here once you heard about the Crown Prince. So, what&#x2019;s your relationship with the prince? Are you two&#x2026; you know&#x2026; like that?&#x201D; She makes a rather vulgar gesture for a girl, grinning cheekily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No! Nothing like that,&#x201D; you reply, suddenly flustered as the memories come back to you. The chambermaids had told you many tales of decadent royal princes and their male companions during your night training, and you <i>had </i>been prepared in body and mind to heed such a request if it was made, yet Shun had never asked.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay&#x2026;&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er speaks up suddenly. &#x201C;Even if Jing is&#x2026; like that&#x2026; I will accept it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I already said that it wasn&#x2019;t like that,&#x201D; you grumble. Qilin laughs at your discomfort, pleased at having found another way to assault your psyche. &#x201C;Anyway,&#x201D; you say quickly, trying to change the topic, &#x201C;I checked out the situation from a few of the nearby villages this morning. Here&#x2019;s how things stand at the moment&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The three of you had arrived before the army began their attack. Qilin had told you that the Wudu Cult headquarters were nestled within Wudu Gorge, which itself was hidden somewhere within a vast sea of bamboo trees. You are in that forest right now, following a path only Qilin knew. The closest settlement to the Wudu Cult was Chishui Town; that is very likely where the ten thousand soldiers would make camp, building a temporary fort on the outskirts of the town as their base of operations in this region. Shun is here, without a doubt, but he is also accompanied by General Lu Bu, an experienced military man who had been a decorated veteran of the Tujue war.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do we know when the attack is going to start?&#x201D; asks Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They&#x2019;re still scouting, but given their manpower it is only a matter of time until they find it. If I were your uncle, I would have used this time to evacuate. Do you think he has done that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; says Qilin, biting her lip. &#x201C;He can be a bit stubborn at times. Besides, where would we go? Not counting the families, the Wudu Sect has more than five hundred members.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You could scatter amongst the villages, hide yourselves there&#x2026; no, that might not work.&#x201D; You catch your mistake quickly. As far as you know, Shun had come here to exterminate the Wudu Cult.<br>
<br>
That meant only one thing &#x2013; if the Wudu members hid amongst the people, the Tang army would operate on the assumption that the villagers were harbouring enemies to the throne.<br>
<br>
They would launch a real campaign of extermination. Pulling back on your oft-forgotten knowledge of politics, you manage to remember some important facts, and realize that this would be easybecause it was Guizhou. The local population in this particular region of Guizhou was largely Miao, and there had always been proposals for settlement of the area with actual Han bandied about amongst the officials.<br>
<br>
You do not know if this was a factor in the decision to mobilize, but you cannot rule it out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are sure that the Wudu Cult would never do such a thing?&#x201D; you ask Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not!&#x201D; replies the girl indignantly as she puts her hands on her hips. &#x201C;Uncle Huodu said that there is not enough gold in the world to pay for the trouble we would get into for poisoning the current Emperor. I cannot believe he would do something so stupid, knowing <i>just </i>how stupid it is!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about the other members of the sect? Ones that you don&#x2019;t know that well? It might be enough to entice them &#x2013; they could think that they would be able to take the payment and run.&#x201D; Of course, you suspect that if the conspirators actually found a lesser member of the Wudu Cult perform the deed, it&#x2019;s quite likely they would ensure all trails leading back to them were removed&#x2026; thoroughly. Whoever was hired would not find a happy ending.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;None of them would be good enough to do the deed,&#x201D; remarks Qilin bluntly. &#x201C;The current Emperor Taisheng was an extreme paranoid in recent years. The only ones with enough skill to get past all that security and poison-testing would be my father and my uncle. No, it would be easier for someone already in the palace to betray the Emperor and strike.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
That could happen, but it would need every Grand Eunuch and much of the first-ranked Ministers to agree for it to even succeed &#x2013; basically, the Emperor would have had his entire court united in wanting him dead, or at least comatose. You are not sure if that is possible&#x2026; but you cannot rule it out.<br>
<br>
Then, of course, there was yet another possible answer: the immortality pills that Emperor Taisheng was so fond of taking. His pursuit of immortality was nothing new; many Emperors, upon realizing that they would not rule forever, delved into alchemy and superstition to find a path to eternity. None of them have ever succeeded. From your herbalism training, you had found out that many of the pills that the Emperor took were likely to be toxic. You wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if he had ended up poisoning himself.<br>
<br>
Still, there was too little to go on for now. You would have to find some more leads before you can come to a conclusion about this matter. Despite your misgivings about Emperor Taisheng&#x2019;s character, he was still the one that plucked you up from poverty and brought you into the palace. You think that you should at least attempt to uncover the truth, as best as you can.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How far is your home from here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We should reach the gorge by tomorrow,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;Chishui Town is in another direction, but even closer. What do you plan to do? Do you want to come with me so I can introduce you to my father, or do you want to visit your beloved prince? If you are going to Chishui, I will meet up with you there after I check back home. It might take a day or two, though.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will follow Qilin all the way to the Wudu Cult. It is probably best that you speak with these expert poisoners and get an idea of what they plan to do about the impending assault, as well as their opinions on this poisoning.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You travel to Chishui Town; the Tang fort is built right next to it, and the Crown Prince will likely be within it. You would like to find out what the military&apos;s plans are first, and Shun will probably be easier for you to persuade.<br>
<b>1. </b>You will attempt to sneak into the fort under the cover of darkness, using your stealth skills to enter his lodgings undetected.<br>
<b>2. </b>You and Cao&#x2019;er will put on an act of being wandering, patriotic physicians to gain entry. You&#x2019;ll try to contact Shun from there.<br>
<b>3. </b>You boldly declare your identity at the gates of the fort and request to see the Crown Prince.

            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Wudu Cult</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll go with you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You savour the rare look of genuine surprise on Qilin&#x2019;s face. It looks like she had been expecting you to go to the Crown Prince as your first order of business.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter, I thought you wanted me to meet your father?&#x201D; you grin. A bit of colour comes into her cheeks as she replies, slightly flustered. &#x201C;O-oh, right. Of course. That&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;ll need to introduce you so that you can take responsibility.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Take responsibility&#x2026; for what?&#x201D; You aren&#x2019;t aware that you had done anything that needs taking responsibility for, but she just hums a little tune and ignores you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The next day, you arrive at the gorge. Qilin leads you down a long flight of slippery, narrow steps hewn from the steep rock walls on either side of the stream. Small thickets of tall bamboo occasionally get in your way &#x2013; you are forced to use your <i>qinggong </i>to skirt around the trees to continue onwards. &#x201C;Is this the only entrance?&#x201D; you ask, lightly leaping over a missing step.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, there is a guest entrance from a large cave further downstream, and another underwater passage which we use to transport supplies. I&#x2019;ll let you see it later,&#x201D; replies Qilin in front of you. Judging from the difficulty of this terrain, it is unlikely the Tang soldiers will be able to attack from this location. You mention that to Qilin, and she laughs, agreeing. &#x201C;The entrance inside the cave is hidden by a secret mechanism that only members of the sect know how to operate, and it is impossible to for anyone to hold their breath long enough to travel the underwater passage.&#x201D; It seems like any attack will much be harder than you had first thought &#x2013; the army would not be able to use their full numbers to bear, and you are certain that the Wudu Cult would have laid traps to further deter intruders.<br>
<br>
As you round a particularly tricky bend, the headquarters of the Wudu Cult comes into view. The buildings are perched on impossible spots all along the both sides of the sheer gorge, linked by long iron chains and wooden planks. They appear to be extensions of chambers in the rock walls. &#x201C;The steps continue on to lead to an entrance hall, but here I usually take a shortcut,&#x201D; explains Qilin. &#x201C;You can try keeping up, or go on ahead to the entrance hall.&#x201D;  She takes on a rather challenging tone, smiling at you. Saying that, she jumps off the rock stairway. Gracefully leaping across the bamboo trees that dot the area, she then bounds up a cliff and lands on top of one of the buildings.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is she, a mountain goat?&#x201D; you mutter. &#x201C;Cao&#x2019;er, what do you think?&#x201D; If she couldn&#x2019;t pull this off, you would walk with her to the entrance hall. Cao&#x2019;er nods. &#x201C;&#x2026;no problem. I can do it.&#x201D; You raise your eyebrows, impressed at the quiet confidence in her voice. &#x201C;Well then, let&#x2019;s do it!&#x201D; You throw yourself off the steps and aim for the nearest tree. As you land on the bamboo, you kick off &#x2013; it bends a lot more than it did for Qilin, where it had barely budged. As a result, your subsequent leap is unstable. You gain less height than you had hoped.<br>
<br>
Angling for the nearest rock, you decide to use an alternate path; your <i>qinggong </i>won&#x2019;t be graceful enough to follow Qilin&#x2019;s exact route. You stick close to the cliff, skirting the side of the gorge as you make small leaps from outcrop to outcrop quickly. As you reach the final stretch, you realize that you are out of footholds to get you closer. It would be embarrassing to get stuck up here. You leap upwards, using your Shouwang Claws to help the climb until you find yourself hanging from a rock.<br>
<br>
There, this height should be sufficient. Concentrating on your feet, you kick off from the rock wall and make a powerful leap away from the cliff. You soar through the sky. The jump brings you a good distance across the gorge, clearing almost half of its width. Making an agile somersault in mid-air, you flip around and land on your feet, albeit a little heavily. You&#x2019;ve made it.<br>
<br>
When you look up, Qilin is laughing at you. &#x201C;What was that all about? You took almost as long as it would have to just follow the steps!&#x201D; You bristle as she continues. &#x201C;Now, Cao&#x2019;er was good. She found an even faster way that I&#x2019;ve never seen before.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s nothing&#x2026; it was just a more efficient way,&#x201D; replies Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;&#x2026;if you saw it too, you could have done it, Jing&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well,&#x201D; you sigh, getting up and dusting yourself off, &#x201C;you&#x2019;ll have to teach me later.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Like father, like daughter.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So you have <i>finally </i>decided to take responsibility for my daughter? Oh, no, I&#x2019;m just kidding. Don&#x2019;t get so nervous,&#x201D; grins Chi Tianxie with a twinkle in his eye. You are in the study of the Scarlet Scorpion, second-in-command of the Wudu Cult and renowned as a powerful martial artist in his own right. Dressed in the colourful clothes of the Miao, he gives off a casual impression of a ruffian, with his untamed beard and receding hairline &#x2013; you must admit, he is not what you expected given the tests he had sent Qilin on. &#x201C;I approve of you, though. You look just the right sort for our ranks, with that hair and that eye-patch,&#x201D; he nods happily. &#x201C;You can start by calling me father-in-law, or just father if you prefer.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father!&#x201D; complains Qilin, &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t the time for your silly tangents!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure you&#x2019;re one to complain, Qilin,&#x201D; you quip. &#x201C;You tend to do the same when it suits you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Chi Tianxie roars in laughter. &#x201C;Yes, I have taught my daughter well, haven&#x2019;t I? It looks like you are going to fit right in, Xu Jing!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father, about the Tang-&#x201C; Qilin tries to get the conversation back on track but her father raises his hand. &#x201C;I know, but we have to wait for Huodu to get back before we can decide on anything.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It looks like the Western Snake isn&#x2019;t on the premises at the moment.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Where is Uncle?&#x201D; asks Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm, well&#x2026;&#x201D; Chi Tianxie grins fiercely, as if appreciating the setup for a joke. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll let him tell you when he returns. He should be back in the evening.&#x201D; You get a slight feeling of unease &#x2013; what if Tulu Huodu had gone ahead to Shun&#x2019;s camp and struck first?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In the meantime, the three of you have travelled a long way. Rest and relax. You might not get a chance in the coming days,&#x201D; continues the Scarlet Scorpion. &#x201C;By the way, that young lady there, you are Shunshi&#x2019;s apprentice, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;yes. It is a pleasure to meet you, Mister Chi&#x2026;&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er nervously. Scratching his beard, Chi replies, &#x201C;Hm, I think I still owe that old man some books for that debacle in Guangzhou. My study is yours, read whatever you want.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er brightens up instantly and manages to mutter some words of thanks before turning the full powers of her concentration on the numerous poison, herbal and medical tomes lining the shelves of the study. With a cheerful grin, Chi Tianxie leaves the study, warning Cao&#x2019;er not to open any drawers just in case. She nods obediently. Meanwhile, Qilin pulls you off on a tour of the Wudu Cult. Talking excitedly all the while, she shows you the places where they cultivate herbs in trays and rear poisonous animals in tanks &#x2013; the cult members seem pleased to see their young mistress finally bring a boy back home: &#x2018;When is the wedding?&#x2019; appears to be a common question for them to ask, which you learn to deflect skilfully. It seems that there are also practice dummies for acupuncture points. You remember your studies with Master Yao, and the book he gave you. The tour manages to give you some new insight, allowing you to reach a breakthrough.<br>
<br>
You look at Qilin, eagerly explaining the properties of the dangerous-looking scorpion in her hand like a little girl. For once, she is not attempting to be a seductive, teasing older lady, and it is refreshing to you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is what you really are like, huh?&#x201D; you say, leaning on a railing that overlooks one of the many waterfalls that line the gorge.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you mean? I&#x2019;m always like this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem happier. More open.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well,&#x201D; she replies indignantly, &#x201C;this <i>is </i>my home after all. It&#x2019;s where I can relax and only worry about the poisons. Ah, that reminds me. I do have to tell the chef not to add any experiments into your food, he can get so over-zealous at times&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
That&#x2019;s right &#x2013; you had almost forgotten. The Wudu Cult is a gang of poisoners who would do anything for the right price. No matter how friendly or carefree they seem, they still trade in death.<br>
<br>
Evening arrives before you know it, and with it, dinner.<br>
<br>
You are invited to eat together with the Chi family; Qilin and her father and Tulu Huodu&#x2019;s spouse &#x2013; Qilin&#x2019;s aunt and her father&#x2019;s sister &#x2013; Chi Huishe. You had wondered why Chi Tianxie was not the heir apparent, and Qilin had told you that the succession was historically  matrilineal. Chi Huishe had been the leader of the Wudu Cult, but upon marriage she had yielded the position to her husband &#x2013; this was exceedingly rare, though no one spoke out against it as they all respected Tulu Huodu&#x2019;s supreme skill at poison. However, as they had not conceived any children, Qilin was designated as the successor.<br>
<br>
All of you are waiting for the head of the family to return before tucking in. You have been poking at your food for the past ten minutes, wondering if it was poisoned. &#x201C;Huodu is not back yet?&#x201D; asks Chi Tianxie. Chi Huishe, a beautiful woman in middle age who bears a strong familial resemblance to Qilin, just smiles. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s here.&#x201D; She flicks her eyes towards the door. As it opens, a tall, old man of about seventy enters &#x2013; you are surprised. You had heard that he should have been younger than Chi Tianxie. Then, you notice that he is wearing the armour and cloak of a Tang general.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My dear, you forgot to remove the disguise,&#x201D; remarks Chi Huishe irritably.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My apologies,&#x201D; croaks the old man as he walks towards the table. He closes his eyes and concentrates, and his features rearrange themselves, taking on a younger texture and pallor. He removes the helmet, showing a bald head underneath. His features are non-descript &#x2013; the only thing that strikes you are his eyes, which seem to be a strange shade of gold. As he sits down, you get up, Cao&#x2019;er following your cue.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing, the disciple of Zhang Jue, greets the leader of the Wudu Sect with the utmost respect,&#x201D; you say, bowing deeply with your hands clasped together. Cao&#x2019;er does the same, muttering an almost unintelligible introduction.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Southern Maniac&#x2019;s apprentice. I see. I have heard that my niece managed to make your acquaintance. You have built quite the reputation for yourself,&#x201D; says the Western Snake calmly. &#x201C;Do not stand on ceremony. Sit.&#x201D; It seems more of an order than a polite request, but you do so without complaint. Looking at the Great Pugilist opposite you, you realize that he feels like the exact opposite of Zhang Jue &#x2013; Master Zhang, even when still, emanated a strong aura of dominance and killing intent. Tulu Huodu, however, appeared to be a void&#x2026;  a blank. You could not read him one bit.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, brother,&#x201D; begins Chi Tianxie as everyone starts eating &#x2013; you more tentatively than the others &#x2013; &#x201C;what news do you bring?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The prince is undecided still,&#x201D; says Tulu Huodu quietly as he places his chopsticks down. &#x201C;It seems that he has already located the entrances to the sect with his own resources some time ago, but he is yet to share it with his soldiers.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is he still holding out for something to change?&#x201D; asks his wife.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, he is wondering whether he should force a change in the situation himself. Of course, he has not told me what he is planning yet. We should be prepared for all eventualities, including betrayal.&#x201D; The Western Snake is cold and calm, measuring his words carefully.<br>
<br>
The exchange stuns you. It almost seems as if Shun had been working together with Tulu Huodu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am sorry to interrupt, Master Tulu, but you have met with the Crown Prince just now? Is he actually an ally of yours?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Tulu Huodu turns his golden gaze to you, holding it there uncomfortably. &#x201C;Yes and no. This is the second time we have met, and we merely find ourselves in the same boat for now, nothing more.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D; exclaims Qilin suddenly. &#x201C;You mean during the tournament, uncle? <i>That </i>was your business?&#x201D; He nods. &#x201C;Yes. I had to go to Chang&#x2019;an instead of Luoyang because of the Prince. He needed to consult me about the immortality pills that the Emperor was taking.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Was he asking for an antidote?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A scary smile floats across Tulu Huodu&#x2019;s lips. &#x201C;Of course not. He was asking me to estimate how much longer the Emperor had if he continued ingesting those pills. From the sample he managed to procure, I gave him an estimate, but I could not make a proper diagnosis without access to the Emperor himself&#x2026; and that is slightly bothersome even for me. Still, that does not matter now; the Emperor&#x2019;s collapse has happened far sooner than both I or the Crown Prince had expected.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You ponder the odds, and ask, &#x201C;Could someone have poisoned him, then, on top of the immortality pills?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is possible, but improbable. It could simply be that the Emperor was in worse shape than I had thought,&#x201D; says Tulu Huodu simply. &#x201C;At any rate, someone has leaked our first meeting to certain factions in the court. That is why the Wudu Sect was quickly named the culprit. I am sure you understand why, Qilin?&#x201D; He turns his attention to his heir, testing her. Qilin swallows her food and looks at her bowl of rice, as if willing the white grains to give her an answer. You already understand the reasons from your experience with court politics, but it would be poor form of you to interrupt. Besides, you think she can do it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;On the off-chance that you really have aligned yourself with the Crown Prince, this would be a perfect way to force him to destroy his own ally, be destroyed by his ally, or be painted as the culprit behind his father&#x2019;s poisoning, should he find excuses not to act?&#x201D; she offers, after some time. That is the same conclusion you had come to. Tulu Huodu nods approvingly. &#x201C;Correct. If he even thought of pushing the blame onto a scapegoat, they would bring up his meeting with me as evidence he poisoned his father. He would not have time to build up a convincing case.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Politics is so troublesome,&#x201D; grumbles Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is how the world works, dear daughter,&#x201D; says Chi Tianxie. &#x201C;What do we do next? I suppose killing the Crown Prince would not solve anything?&#x201D; You wince inwardly at this blunt talk of assassinating Shun. Tulu Huodu shakes his head. &#x201C;Even if I wanted to, he is well-guarded. There appears to be a master of stealth around his person, someone who I could barely sense. I can easily defeat that man in a fight, but <i>he</i> could detect my arrival long before I made it to the Crown Prince&#x2019;s side. I would be exposed and surrounded quickly. It would not really solve anything but give the Court an excuse to send a hundred thousand men the next time even if I manage to succeed, and I would much rather have the Crown Prince than any of his wastrel brothers anyway.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then, we run,&#x201D; says Chi Huishe.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, that is the most sensible option. We should retreat and hide, biding our time. I have established plenty of safehouses the families can use,&#x201D; replies her brother. They seem to have been more prepared for this than Qilin had expected.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about the people living in this area?&#x201D; you ask, knowing that should the Wudu Cult go missing, Shun may be forced to put villages to the sword just to root out the cultists.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about them?&#x201D; asks Tulu Huodu emotionlessly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If they cannot find you, the army will kill them in order to drag the Wudu Sect refugees out into the open,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;You would just be getting them into trouble.&#x201D; The Western Snake laughs coldly, a strange glitter in his eyes. &#x201C;Then that is their misfortune. My concern is with taking care of those who follow me&#x2026; there is no room in this venture for misguided nobility. This is amusing; I had not expected a disciple of the <i>Southern Maniac</i> to say such a thing!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is not an easy thing for us to do, but we have always lived a relatively self-sufficient lifestyle,&#x201D; explains Chi Tianxie. &#x201C;We do not owe the villages and towns in Guizhou anything.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They do come to us for remedies and medicines, and we have kept bandits away through fear even though it was only in our self-interest,&#x201D; Qilin says. &#x201C;Father, Uncle, in some ways they look up to us. I have been in the villages. They do not dislike our presence, but if we withdraw now and leave them to the slaughter, they <i>will </i>hate us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are entirely correct, Qilin,&#x201D; says Chi Huishe, &#x201C;but do we have any other choice? Or would you rather the entire sect be slaughtered? Even with all of our advantages, we cannot defeat an army ten thousand strong.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;All of this is premature,&#x201D; says Tulu Huodu suddenly. &#x201C;The Crown Prince has arranged for another meeting in Chishui, two days from now. The evacuation will be nearly complete by then, but what happens next is entirely up to him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Luring him away from his army, eh?&#x201D; grins Chi Tianxie.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, that is not my intention, and Li Shun is not fool enough to fall for that. If he is confident enough in his safety to make the proposal, he must have considered everything thoroughly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So-&#x201C; you begin, but Tulu Huodu cuts you off. &#x201C;If you want to come along, Xu Jing, feel free. I am sure you would like to see the Prince again. No, there is no need to be surprised. I am not that stupid.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you know I am working for the Crown Prince, why talk about your plans in front of me?&#x201D; you say, confused, &#x201C;Are you not afraid that I would report to him and betray you?&#x201D; Besides you, Cao&#x2019;er seems entirely unconcerned, focusing on her food.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Would you? Once you marry Qilin, all of this will also be yours in the future. Why sabotage your own powerbase like this?&#x201D; replies Tulu Huodu without batting an eye. &#x201C;Though we may be facing a crisis, it is nothing that will last. People with our expertise will always be in demand. We will survive, and return stronger than ever. You would do well with us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait, what, I didn&#x2019;t&#x2026; Qilin, <i>what</i> have you been telling them?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t say anything,&#x201D; she says meekly, not looking you in the eye for once. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not ready to marry anyone just yet.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My daughter really didn&#x2019;t say anything,&#x201D; laughs Chi Tianxie, &#x201C;but she would not have brought a man home, into this place, if she wasn&#x2019;t serious. At least, it shows that she really trusts you, and I can tell you that is as rare as the silver snowdrop, Xu Jing. Well, that is not important right now! At least I can see that you don&#x2019;t think it is. Huodu, do not scare the young ones like that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Western Snake closes his eyes and shrugs. &#x201C;The both of you could do far worse than each other.&#x201D; When he puts it like that, in his rational, calm way, he almost seems convincing. &#x201C;No matter. Qilin, you will come along with me for the meeting. After that, you will leave Guizhou until everything blows over.&#x201D; He phrases his words firmly and coldly. The normally chatty Qilin bows her head and only says, &#x201C;Yes, Uncle,&#x201D; realizing that this is not the time for further questions.<br>
<br>

<br>
After the dinner, you find yourself wandering around the cult&#x2019;s buildings. The scenery is beautiful even at night; the moonlight sparkles off the waterfalls and the sight and sound of the bamboo trees waving gently in the night breeze is soothing. Cao&#x2019;er follows behind you, engrossed in a book she had taken from the Scarlet Scorpion&#x2019;s study. Suddenly, you hear the sound of screams for help and cries of battle from the top of the gorge. &#x201C;Cao&#x2019;er, I&#x2019;m going to check it out-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;going with you&#x2026;&#x201D; she mutters, as she tucks the book away. There&#x2019;s no stopping her when she&#x2019;s like this. You nod.<br>
<br>
Using your <i>qinggong</i> again, you reach the top of the gorge. There you find one injured Wudu member, and one dead. &#x201C;Ah, it&#x2019;s the young master!&#x201D; exclaims the girl tearfully, cradling her dead friend. You are not sure when you had become the &#x2018;young master&#x2019;, but now is not the time to right her misconception. &#x201C;What happened here?&#x201D; you ask, though looking at the scene it is clear that they had been attacked.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;T-Tang scouts! We were patrolling and spotted them, and they attacked us to get away,&#x201D; says the girl. She points to the direction of the trees, where the scouts would have went. Looking closely, you can just about make out their tracks &#x2013; these were not highly skilled woodsmen on Yoriwaka&apos;s level. Shun had kept the location of the cult a secret from his men, but it did not rule out them discovering it themselves.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How many were there?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Six, maybe seven&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t know. They caught us by surprise... they were too quick.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do we go after them?&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er asks, tugging at your sleeves. You look down at the Wudu Cult buildings &#x2013; torches were being brought out. The other cultists would be here soon.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You go after the scouts. You might be able to take them alive, or you might not, but they cannot be allowed to get back to their camp. Shun&#x2019;s parley with Tulu Huodu is in two days&#x2019; time &#x2013; you will not allow anything to stand in the way even if they are soldiers serving your liege.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will let the Wudu Cult do their own tracking. You will not participate in the killing of Tang soldiers who were only doing their job &#x2013; raising your hand against loyal subordinates of the dynasty has always been anathema to you. Let the dice fall where they may.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You take this opportunity to flee towards the Prince&#x2019;s camp, following the trail of the scouts while pretending to be trying to stop them. You need to find out what he has planned, and tell him about the Wudu Cult&#x2019;s own plans for evacuation.

            <h3>五十 · Royal Reunion</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Royal Reunion</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;I can get them from here,&#x201D; mumbles Cao&#x2019;er. You had managed to stay on the trail of the retreating scouts. They had paused for a while to get their horses, allowing you to catch up to them. There are seven of them &#x2013; a bit more than you think you could handle without allowing any to slip past you. Standing a good distance away, Cao&#x2019;er rummages around in her pack and brings out a half dozen polished little stones. Taking aim, she flicks the stones at the soldiers. You recognize the technique &#x2013; Master Yao&#x2019;s Tanzhi Divine Skill. The stones fly with unerring accuracy, hitting three of the scouts in the <i>tianzhong </i>and <i>mingmen </i>points in their back. They topple over, unconscious. Their comrades shout out in surprise, but to your amazement they recover quickly, drawing their crossbows and aiming into the darkness. It looks like these men have been well-trained. You push Cao&#x2019;er down, telling her to stay quiet &#x2013; you do not want any stray bolts hitting her.<br>
<br>
Then, you rush out, a swift shade bursting out from the darkness. If you wait a second longer, the remaining four men will mount their horses and flee. There is no time to hesitate. You drive your fist into the temple of the first scout you reach, felling him before he can get a shot off with his crossbow. As you make for the other men, the horses whinny, rearing up suddenly before falling to the ground, kicking in protest. Taking advantage of the chaos, you pounce upon two of them from behind, sinking your claws in around their spine. They convulse and fall to the ground, incapacitated by the pain.<br>
<br>
The last scout turns to face you with a yell of desperation. A cloud of soil scatters in front of your face &#x2013; the soldier has grabbed a handful of earth and thrown it. He moves faster than you expected, managing to get into the blind spot of your missing eye while you are distracted. You hear the sound of his sword being unsheathed. The slash comes unseen. You turn your head on instinct, wincing slightly as the blade travels past your cheek smoothly, leaving behind a shallow cut.<br>
<br>
You retaliate with an upwards strike. Warm blood splashes over your hand; you feel your opponent&#x2019;s flesh give way. There is a ripping noise, and you rend his sword-arm clean from his body. The arm twitches in your grasp as you look at the writhing, screaming soldier apologetically. &#x201C;Sorry,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t mean to do that.&#x201D; Dropping the arm, you call Cao&#x2019;er over to treat the soldiers as best as she can.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That was remarkable.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A bodiless voice rings out throughout the dark bamboo forest. You look around you, but all you can see are the shadows of rustling leaves. Suddenly, a man drops out of the trees, landing right besides you. You attack, startled, but he stops your fist without even a hint of effort. He laughs, and you realize that it is Tulu Huodu. &#x201C;You are like a beast that requires taming. I would not have expected any less from Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple.&#x201D; Pulling your hand away, you step back and bow. &#x201C;Master Tulu, I apologize for my offense.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your attack did not offend me. Be at ease.&#x201D; The leader of the Wudu Cult looks around at the aftermath of the battle and nods. &#x201C;I see you left some of them alive. Good. You did well&#x2026; they may have gotten away if you did not lend us a hand. My followers will be here soon to take care of matters. You may return and rest.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you for your consideration. Are they to be taken prisoner?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In a manner of speaking, yes,&#x201D; replies Tulu Huodu, and he says no more on the subject.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Chi Tianxie had insisted that you spend the past two days talking with him &#x2013; it seems that he had plenty of questions about the sort of wife you would be keen to have. You had dodged what you could and nodded along while he extolled his daughter&#x2019;s virtues. Qilin, on the other hand, cleverly hid somewhere to be free from her father&#x2019;s meddling, bringing Cao&#x2019;er along for company.<br>
<br>
Still, the day of the meeting comes before you know it.<br>
<br>
Chishui Town turns out to be a small, sleepy place nestling comfortably besides the river it was named after. To your surprise, you see soldiers laboring around the town; some were bringing in crops, while others were perched on top of roofs and mending holes. There were even some soldiers digging irrigation ditches in the fields. It was not the scene that you had been expecting. It looks like Shun had not been keeping his men idle in the camp, but had instead sent them out to assist the townsfolk in their menial tasks.<br>
<br>
You wonder what Shun is planning&#x2026;<br>
<br>
The inn that was designated as the meeting place is devoid of customers. There are no soldiers guarding it either. Feeling slightly nervous, you follow Tulu Huodu up the stairs. Qilin is here upon his orders, and of course Cao&#x2019;er is by your side, but the Scarlet Scorpion and his sister had remained behind at the Wudu Cult, directing the evacuation. They had moved quickly after the scouting party was discovered, scattering towards huts and cabins all over the countryside.<br>
<br>
Finally, you reach the room where Shun is waiting. Without so much as a knock, Tulu Huodu pushes it open.<br>
<br>
Shun is alone in the room.<br>
<br>
The Crown Prince has grown a lot in the time that you were not by his side. Though the two of you had always been of the same height as children, he is now nearly half-a-head taller than you are. His boyish brashness is gone, replaced by the quiet confidence of one who is used to command. He is sitting in front of a table on which a chess set has been laid out; as Tulu Huodu enters, the prince does not bother getting up from his chair. He flicks his eyes towards him, and then at the people behind him. When he spots you, however, his glance pauses for a while, and his eyes widen in recognition. Then, he gets up, knocking the chair back in his haste.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Jing! My brother!&#x201D; he exclaims, arms held open. Tulu Huodu gives the two of you a curious look as you step forward to embrace the prince, a wide grin on your face. &#x201C;As I thought&#x2026;&#x201D; &#x201C;&#x2026;yes&#x2026;&#x201D; You hear Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er whispering to each other, but you ignore them for now.  &#x201C;What are you doing here &#x2013; no, what <i>happened </i>to you?&#x201D; asks Shun as he looks at your eye-patch and hair. &#x201C;I did some training so that I could come here and push you down to second-most handsome man in the room,&#x201D; you explain. The prince laughs, slapping you on the shoulder. &#x201C;It must be a very interesting story. Tell me more about it later.&#x201D; Giving Tulu Huodu an apologetic look, he says, &#x201C;I am sorry, but he is an old friend. I could not help but be carried away.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No matter,&#x201D; smiles the Western Snake thinly as he takes a seat after bowing to the prince. &#x201C;I am surprised that you acknowledged him so easily, Your Highness. I would have thought that you would be more&#x2026; circumspect about this issue.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun returns the smile. &#x201C;Since he came along with you, I am sure you know of his connection to me. There is no need to hide.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is as you say, Your Highness,&#x201D; says Tulu Huodu with a deferential nod.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Before we begin, Master Tulu, I need to inform you that the seven men you sent into my camp have been taken into custody safely. I will return them to you after this, unharmed,&#x201D; says the prince matter-of-factly. He looks down at the chessboard and moves a piece forward, as if challenging the Western Snake to a chess match. Tulu Huodu arches an eyebrow, the only sign of surprise that he gives, before making his own move, accepting Shun&#x2019;s challenge. &#x201C;I am afraid I cannot say the same for the scouts they pretended to be. Two of them did not survive, while the others have been broken in mind. Still, I am impressed that my followers were caught, Your Highness.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would not march all the way down here without taking precautions,&#x201D; says Shun quietly as he sips from his cup of tea. &#x201C;It is a shame about the soldiers, but such is the price of lies. There is no room for regret in the path I am about to take. Is the evacuation complete?&#x201D; His chariot takes a stray horse.<br>
<br>
Tulu Huodu is still &#x2013; very still &#x2013; as he chuckles softly. &#x201C;You continue to surprise me at every turn, Your Highness. Yes, it is.&#x201D; Moving his pawn, Tulu Huodu takes the chariot. In truth, it had still been ongoing when you left the Wudu Cult this morning, though they estimated that the process would be complete by the end of the day.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; says the prince, lifting another chess piece and placing it down in a strategic position. &#x201C;It seems I am fated to put the people of my own country to the sword, one way or another.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you really going to go through with this, Shun? It won&#x2019;t help you find the Wudu Cult members,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I know that if you do not you will be deemed an unfilial son, but something tells me that by doing so you will fall into your enemies&#x2019; trap all the same.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, yes, I underestimated them,&#x201D; sighs Shun. &#x201C;I only needed to trip up once for them to gain a leverage over me. As it is, there is no perfect solution to this situation. No matter what I do, innocent people will die, and the longer I delay, the stronger my enemies get.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, I take it that you have your answer, Your Highness? You will begin burning Guizhou to the ground, village by village?&#x201D;  asks Tulu Huodu, countering the prince&#x2019;s moves on the board.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No.&#x201D; The exchange of chess continues, and though you try to follow it, you have not played in too long; the prince&#x2019;s chess skills seem to have far outstripped yours.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then, you plan to defeat me?&#x201D; Tulu Huodu&#x2019;s horse places Shun&#x2019;s general in check.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not,&#x201D; denies Shun. &#x201C;No one here could stop you from killing me, and I happen to be rather fond of my head.&#x201D; The general moves, evading the horse.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I happen to prefer your head where it is, too. Your death would be troublesome,&#x201D; agrees Tulu Huodu as he presses the advantage on the chessboard. &#x201C;What <i>do </i>you plan to do, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We force a change in the situation. There is only one way to do this,&#x201D; says Shun, smiling wanly as he pushes a piece forward, past the boundary on the board denoting the Chu River. &#x201C;Rivers are there to be crossed. If the threat of being deemed unfit for the throne by some corrupt officials is all that keeps me from doing what is right for the people, I am not fit to be Emperor in the first place. Checkmate.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Tulu Huodu looks down at the board and murmurs, &#x201C;The flying general. You plan to&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Emperor must die.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Raising his hand, Shun smashes his own piece down on the opposing general, shattering the enemy piece. &#x201C;I will take the throne by my own hand.&#x201D; Tulu Huodu leans back, his eyes glittering with admiration. &#x201C;Your ambition will serve you well, Your Highness, but <i>can </i>it be done?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is reckless!&#x201D; you blurt out, aghast at your prince&#x2019;s treasonous speech, but Shun shakes his head. &#x201C;It is a gamble, yes, but for me it is already a do or die situation. Should I capitulate to their whims now and carry out a massacre, I will lose support from the connections I have cultivated, and as long as my father is alive, they may claim to speak on his behalf. If they are going to call me unfilial, and a traitor, I would be better off living up to those names. After all, when I become Emperor, they will start to sing a different tune.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Looking at you, Shun continues explaining his plan. &#x201C;In my absence from the capital, should the Emperor sadly pass away, my brothers will begin their bid for power instantly. They cannot afford to wait and see what I do this far south&#x2026; they will attempt to claim the throne for themselves. However, as the Crown Prince my legitimacy is set in stone. My father&#x2019;s will cannot be changed. It may be forged, but I have taken pains to ensure that will not happen. If they refuse to acknowledge my rule, they will be deemed as traitors.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And when you ascend, people will stop caring whether or not you actually did poison the former Emperor,&#x201D; remarks Tulu Huodu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is right. The people are only concerned for a comfortable life and a just rule,&#x201D; says Shun.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What of the army? I am sure your brothers have military backing of their own. How would you even assassinate the Emperor in the first place? If it was so easy, the others would have done it already.&#x201D; You are not yet convinced that this is the best path to take, if only because you do not want Shun to be responsible for the death of his own father. You are aware that there is little love lost between the two of them, but still, they are flesh and blood.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have not been idle these past few years. I have secured backing from a great majority of the generals and military prefects in the country, but given the circumstances I believe they may want to wait and see whether I am worthy before throwing their lot in with me. I expect them to stay out of this when I make my move. This will not be a repeat of the war my father participated in, if you are worried about that.&#x201D; Shun speaks with confidence, tossing and catching one of the chess pieces.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As for ending my father&#x2019;s life, I can have men in place quickly. As it so happens, I finally managed to wrest control of the secret police just recently. The only reason the Emperor is still alive right now is because his death would bring me to the throne, and that would be a galling prospect for many of my brothers. Even though they have no love for our father, they would fight tooth and nail to prevent me from ruling. I must admit, this happened a lot sooner than I expected. It would take me a few weeks to prepare, and even then I do not have the manpower to make it a certainty. The assassination itself may very well fail. As I have said, it is a gamble. Just the sort you would like.&#x201D; He grins.<br>
<br>
You sigh. It does look like he has thought about this carefully.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If that is the case, the Wudu Cult will assist you in this endeavor,&#x201D; says Tulu Huodu calmly. &#x201C;We will not strike at the Emperor ourselves, but we have people in and around the palace in Chang&#x2019;an that will keep an eye out for your agents.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are not going to have them collaborate directly?&#x201D; laughs Shun.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not. That would risk exposing them. Some will come to help should things not go as planned, and they may perform some simple tricks with food and drink, but nothing more. Your men should be capable enough to do their job alone in the first place.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I would hope so,&#x201D; says the prince.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What if&#x2026; the assassination fails?&#x201D; you venture.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I lose my agents and my support, though the latter would vanish anyway should I dance like a puppet here in Guizhou. If I am unlucky, the fallout leads to the army withdrawing their support from me, in which case I can fully expect to be enthroned on the end of a pike,&#x201D; says Shun cheerfully. &#x201C;If my luck is good, I retain some military support, and will be able to clash with my siblings on the battlefield. That is a war I am confident of winning, eventually. If the assassination occurs successfully, however, I have a contingency in place that will allow me to take the throne with minimal bloodshed. That is what I am aiming for.<br>
<br>
He sighs, suddenly looking rather tired. &#x201C;Honestly, this would have happened sooner or later. It is just that my father had the unfortunate timing of going into a coma before I was ready. That is why the risks are high, not only for me, but for the empire itself. I could stand my ground here and do nothing, but the longer I wait, the more time it gives the others to spin their plots. I have been caught flat-footed this time, but with my father&apos;s death, <i>everyone </i>will be on unstable ground instead of just myself. Then, I can only trust that I have made sufficient preparations to come out ahead. This is the only chance I have. I have heard stories of your exploits, Jing. I will not order you around, but&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He looks at you, and you can hear the unspoken question. Will you assist him?<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You cannot bring yourself to do this. Though you know the consequences will be dire should Shun&#x2019;s gambit fail &#x2013; he may die, or plunge the entire country back into a war &#x2013; it is too risky and ungrateful since the Emperor himself brought you in once before. You will help in any other way you can, but not with this patricidal plot.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>It is not like you have to strangle the Emperor with your own two hands; both the assassination and Shun&#x2019;s plan to defeat his rivals will occur almost simultaneously, and there are other parts of the plot you can help with. You will assist him with his attempt to take the throne. The country will be the better off for it, Shun will be the better off for it, and even you will be the better off for it, in the end.

            <h3>五十一 · Another Path</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Another Path</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really? You haven&#x2019;t bedded them? I&#x2019;m surprised!&#x201D; laughs the prince. The two of you are catching up and exchanging stories late into the night, accompanied by wine. Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er had retired to another room to give you two room, while Tulu Huodu had returned to the Wudu Cult to brief his men.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you take me for, some libidinous maniac?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I <i>did </i>think you were the sort that did anything that moved. Certainly the chambermaids were full of assorted tales as proof. Are those girls that unattractive to you? I thought they were rather fetching, myself.&#x201D; Shun grins as he downs another cup of wine, his lips loosened by the drink.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s not that. It&#x2019;s just that&#x2026;&#x201D; You cannot find the words to express how you feel at the moment. Shun gives you an evil grin, wagging his finger. &#x201C;Ah, I get it. I understand. You can&#x2019;t get it up if they mean something to you? Virginity is a state of mind, and you are a virgin when it comes to serious relationships, eh?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Better get over that mental block, my friend, or else some poor girls are going to be really disappointed in the future.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You throw a cup at him, missing his head by a fair distance as it breaks against the wall. The Crown Prince laughs. &#x201C;Just like old times,&#x201D; he grins happily. &#x201C;Anyway, so the plan is divided into two main parts?&#x201D; you ask, attempting to change the topic. &#x201C;Back to the plan, huh?&#x201D; sighs the prince wearily. &#x201C;Yes. First my agents will ensure that the Emperor passes away peacefully and naturally. Then, once his passing is announced, a good majority of my brothers who think they qualify for the throne will rush into the palace. There will be bickering, though whether bloodshed will ensue is still up in the air. When they are all gathered in one place, all thoughts of caution thrown to the wind in their blind ambition, we will capture them and secure the palace for my arrival.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In order for it to be perfect, however, you need a further distraction. Something &#x2013; or someone &#x2013; that will pull their attention away from your men maneuvering behind the scenes, and ensure that they are all gathered in one spot&#x2026;&#x201D; you say, leaning against the table.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. I would prefer that you take that role. Leave the Emperor&#x2019;s death in my hands.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are your men on that side trustworthy?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; he says confidently. &#x201C;Of course, if you really do want to assist in the assassination, I will not say no. Your presence will make me relieved either way.&#x201D; Shun looks down, muttering, &#x201C;It will all soon be over at any rate.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure about this, Shun?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course. What other choice do I have?&#x201D; His voice is pained &#x2013; as he looks up at you, you realize that he had been putting up a front when dealing with Tulu Huodu. Only now, when it is just the two of you alone, could he relax and be true to his own heart. He is not as sure of his path as he seemed to be even though he has resolved to carry it through to the end. &#x201C;If I could wait for him to awaken I would, but that would lead to pointless deaths of innocents in the meantime. Better to sacrifice his life for his country. It is more than he has ever done in all his years in power anyway,&#x201D; says Shun bitterly. The both of you fall silent.<br>
<br>
After a while, you break the silence. &#x201C;Do you really need him dead? What if he just disappears?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are you talking about?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What if his pills truly turned him immortal, and he ascended into Heaven?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun stares at you. &#x201C;Are you drunk? Those pills don&#x2019;t work! We know that!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But no one would dare to claim otherwise, right? It&#x2019;s the same reason why you cannot just say he did himself in,&#x201D; you say, inspiration flooding into your mind. &#x201C;So&#x2026; if he goes missing in a way only an immortal could, say, from his chambers which have been barred from the inside, and leaves behind a note of some sort saying that he is now in the Celestial Palace and he is very happy, and everyone should follow you as the new Emperor&#x2026; what would happen?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun bites his lower lip pensively. &#x201C;I&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t know. It&#x2019;s crazy. It just might&#x2026; There would be arguments amongst the brothers until I manage to return anyway, but it would certainly reduce the number of siblings willing to make a bid for the throne. What <i>are </i>you thinking of, anyway?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you do not truly want to kill your father, you do not have to, Shun. There are plenty of retired emperors amongst your own ancestors. Emperor Zhaozong, Emperor Shunzong, Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Ruizong&#x2026; even the founding Emperor, Emperor Gaozu himself, chose to abdicate and allow his son to rule. It would be no surprise for Emperor Taisheng to retire to Heaven as an immortal, which is a far better place than any of the other emperors went to in retirement,&#x201D; you explain. &#x201C;There is precedent&#x2026; and the best part is, no one can say otherwise. All we have to do is kidnap the Emperor. It is a good thing he is not conscious&#x2026; I mean to say, his spirit is communing with the Jade Emperor and has temporarily relinquished its mortal shell.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Kidnap the Emperor!&#x201D; Shun can only laugh in disbelief. &#x201C;Stealing him away from the Imperial Palace is far more difficult than ending his life, Jing. Where would you even put him, afterwards? Is there any place safe enough to hide him until he reaches the end of his life?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I happen to know an island paradise in the southern seas&#x2026; I assure you, the Emperor will not know the difference.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
This time, Shun&#x2019;s laughter is from genuine amusement. &#x201C;You&#x2026; Jing, you really are something else. Always&#x2026; always you turn all my logic on its head and show me another path. Oh, how I wish I could go with this plan. It would be so much more fun. So much less troubling.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why won&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Because I cannot trust anyone besides you to carry it out. Having the Emperor disappear is one thing&#x2026; having him alive, and possibly waking up someday&#x2026; that is something I cannot entrust to just anyone. I can only trust <i>you </i>with it. You are the only one in this world I can trust to act according to my heart and not what you think is best for me. As your brother I <i>know </i>you mean well and it is a plan that I think would be wonderful, but as your prince I dread the consequences should you fail. Do you know what that means?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You understand what he is saying. Succeed or fail, this plan&#x2019;s responsibility will lie on your shoulders&#x2026; or rather, your head. That is the only way Shun can afford to justify allowing you to carry out this mission both to himself and to his agents in the capital that are awaiting his orders. The assassination <i>is </i>the less risky path, compared to getting away with an unconscious Emperor from the middle of the Imperial Palace, but still&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will participate in the assassination attempt. The agents may need backup if things go wrong, and having them get away unnoticed is the most urgent detail of the entire plan. Here is where your attentions should be focused.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You act as the distraction, as Shun wishes. This should be a relatively easy task, though no less risky &#x2013; you would have to face his brothers and laugh in their faces. It would be rather interesting to rub their royal pride in the mud.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You persuade Shun to carry out Operation Immortal. Let the Emperor Taisheng be known forever as the one who had succeeded in attaining immortality and the wisdom of the universe, and then send him off as an addition to Zhang Jue&#x2019;s collection of oddities.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
While preparing for the mission, Chi Tianxie and Yoriwaka have offered some training as help. The Scarlet Scorpion, seemingly eager for you to gain a better impression of him and his daughter, approaches you with several suggestions:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Wudu Fushun (Five Poisons Taming, &#x4E94;&#x6BD2;&#x670D;&#x99B4;) The ability to tame and train the five principle poisonous animals of the Wudu Cult - the snake, the centipede, the toad, the scorpion and the spider - to do your bidding. Real experts are said to be able to use these animals as scouts, and even command an army of them.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Ruanhong Zhusuo (Crimson Spider Silken Ropes, &#x8EDF;&#x7D05;&#x86DB;&#x7D22;) A technique that relies on the Wudu Cult&#x2019;s specially treated spider silk, which is as tough as steel. The threads can be used to enhance offense or defense in equal measure when wrapped tightly, and are extremely effective at binding enemies when unravelled.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b><i>Qinggong </i>upgrade: Through incorporation of the Wudu Cult&#x2019;s own <i>qinggong</i>, you manage to raise your skill. (<i>Qinggong </i>+1, Kuanglang Step upgraded to +3 Stealth, +2 Agility)<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Yoriwaka, impressed at your loyalty to the Prince on undertaking this dangerous mission, has offered more help so that you may succeed at your task and return alive.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Reikan upgrade: Upon further instruction from Yoriwaka, Reikan now increases your perception by a greater amount. (Reikan upgraded to +3 Perception)<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Kagemi. (&#x5F71;&#x8EAB;, Shadow Body). A method of silent moving that melds well with your Kuanglang Step &#x2013; Kuanglang Step will increase to a higher level, allowing you to be undetectable to all but an elite few. (Additional +2 Stealth to Kuanglang Step).

            <h3>五十二 · Disappearance of the Golden Emperor</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Disappearance of the Golden Emperor</span></b><br>
<br>
Prince Li Jiawu of the Great Tang Empire frowned, his thick fingers tapping irritably on the polished wooden desk. He stared at the eunuch in front of him before finally letting out a great sigh and granting his servant permission to leave. The eunuch&#x2019;s face was flushed with relief as he bowed and departed the prince&#x2019;s chambers hastily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you think about all this&#x2026; nonsense, Grand Eunuch Li?&#x201D; He turned and glanced at the elderly statesman, who was reclining on a comfortable couch, attended to by two child eunuchs of his own. &#x201C;Hm?&#x201D; Grand Eunuch Li raised his distinguished head and smiled. &#x201C;This matter of Emperor Taisheng ascending to Heaven?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, of course. That is the matter to which I refer.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What of it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Prince Jiawu forced himself to swallow a retort at the Grand Eunuch&#x2019;s disrespectful, mocking smile. It would not do for him to lose his temper &#x2013; the Grand Eunuch&#x2019;s backing was essential if he was to make sure that brat of a Crown Prince  tastes defeat. &#x201C;Do you not think it curious?&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Even my mother, Lady Wu, has been picking up such gossip from the servants, and she has expressed her concern to me numerous times.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yet we cannot stop them from talking, Your Highness,&#x201D; drawled the eunuch as he raised his wrinkled hand for one of his attendants to massage. &#x201C;It is an open secret that the Emperor had been seeking the fruits of immortality. If you were to insist on stamping out all talk of him succeeding&#x2026; that would be rather naughty. Rest assured your brothers would spin it to your disadvantage.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But they are claiming to witness all these little omens happening all over the place! Incense smelling sweeter than usual, a shower of rain from a clear sky-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Patience, Your Highness.&#x201D; The Grand Eunuch spoke crisply, cutting the prince short. &#x201C;If you are concerned that this is the Crown Prince&#x2019;s plot, planned in retaliation for sending him to Guizhou, there is no need to worry. My best agent has informed me that the Crown Prince is still agonizing over how to resolve his problem down south. He has no men to spare to meddle in Chang&#x2019;an.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Prince Jiawu looked unconvinced. Scratching his beard, he leaned forward on the table. &#x201C;You mean&#x2026; Gao Ying?&#x201D; He whispered the name hesitantly, as if to say it out loud would invite some form of trouble. &#x201C;Can we trust him?&#x201D; Grand Eunuch Li shook his head. &#x201C;Trust no one. This is a lesson both Grand Eunuchs Wei and Wang will learn very soon. They still believe he is working for them, when in truth he is working for me. I do not trust Gao Ying, but there is no benefit to him betraying me. We are all men of the world. We deal in tangible matters&#x2026; certain rewards. After all, Your Highness, once the Crown Prince falls you are closest to the throne. It will not be long now. Soon we will be ready to tighten the vise around Li Shun&#x2019;s neck.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. Yes, you are right, Grand Eunuch. As usual,&#x201D; said the prince with some measure of relief. &#x201C;I am sure-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
An urgent knock at the door interrupted his words. &#x201C;Who is it? What is it?&#x201D; snapped the prince, his patience of late already tested sorely by the incessant rumours of his father&#x2019;s ascension flooding the palace.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your Highness, prince! I&#x2026; er&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Spit it out, servant!&#x201D; grumbled Prince Jiawu as he got up from his desk.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s news&#x2026; from the palace physician, Your Highness. The Emperor seems to have awakened.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The prince took an involuntary step back, his face paling. &#x201C;W-what? Are you sure?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your Highness, that was what the physician claimed,&#x201D; came the reply. &#x201C;P-perhaps you would want to see for yourself?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is the surprise, Your Highness?&#x201D; asked the Grand Eunuch calmly. &#x201C;Though the palace physician assured us that the Emperor&#x2019;s own actions have led to a coma, he also said that he was not certain if the Emperor would ever wake again. There was always a chance of this happening.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I understand,&#x201D; replied Prince Jiawu, calming himself as he puffed his chest out. &#x201C;The throne will be mine sooner or later. I must present a proper face to His Majesty. Come, Grand Eunuch, let us be the first to greet the Emperor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father, are you there?&#x201D; shouted Prince Jiawu. There was no response &#x2013; nothing had changed from the moment he arrived ten minutes ago. The door was locked, though the lights were lit. With a snarl, he turned to the physician. &#x201C;You told me that His Majesty was awake. What is the meaning of this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;B-b-but Your Highness, I <i>did </i>see his silhouette through the windows. I tried opening the doors but he grunted at me. Then, I smelt sulphur. Your Highness, you understand very well that His Majesty dislikes people entering his quarters when he is performing alchemical experiments!&#x201D; protested the physician fearfully as he shrank back from the angry prince.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, brother, what is this? Were you threatening Father&#x2019;s personal physician?&#x201D; Prince Jiawu cursed his luck as he saw his younger sibling arrive with a cocky grin. &#x201C;This is none of your business, Zhuangchen.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How can it be none of my business?&#x201D; laughed Prince Zhuangchen. &#x201C;I heard from some sources that Father was awake. With all these recent rumours of him ascending to Heaven bodily&#x2026; well, you know I just had to take a look. I am sure the rest of our siblings will be here quite soon.&#x201D; Prince Jiawu narrowed his eyes, glaring at his younger brother. Could he be the one who had spread those rumours? It was possible, thought Prince Jiawu. Zhuangchen was a conniving little bastard, like his mother. Lady Wu often complained about the two.<br>
<br>
As the two princes waited impatiently in front of the doors to the Emperor&#x2019;s personal chambers for their father to respond, more and more of their siblings arrived. There were princes and there were princesses, and they began calling out to their father, begging for him to say something.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It looks like it is going to be a long night, my friends.&#x201D; Grand Eunuch Li bowed to the other Grand Eunuchs, a fair distance away from the royalty. The Grand Eunuchs Li, Wei, Wang and Zhao &#x2013; the real powers behind the government &#x2013; would not have missed this for the world, despite their advanced age. As the minutes ticked by, Prince Zhuangchen spoke up. &#x201C;This could be dangerous. What if His Majesty has collapsed again?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The royal siblings looked at each other worriedly. &#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If he hasn&#x2019;t, and you broke in, he would be quite angry,&#x201D; muttered the young Princess Taile. The one unspoken thought running through most of their minds was if it was okay to just leave the Emperor to his own devices. After all, even if he died&#x2026; Grand Eunuch Li sidled to the perplexed Prince Jiawu and whispered in his ear. He broke into a brief grin before loudly declaring, &#x201C;I will take responsibility for this. We break down the door. It is our own father! Should we not be concerned? This is not the time to worry about his wrath &#x2013; I will suffer it gladly if it means he is healthy and well.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Saying that, he threw his strong body against the door. It creaked, but did not fully give way. The Emperor&#x2019;s chambers were well-barred. He tried again. The perplexed guards and his siblings began to help out in a rare show of brotherly cooperation. Finally, the door was thrown open and they stumbled into the room.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father! Father, where are you?&#x201D; shouted Prince Jiawu as he strode around the quarters, looking for the Emperor. It was a large chamber, complete with its own study and the Emperor&#x2019;s alchemical benches. There was a large cauldron boiling over. The stink of sulphur filled the air, and the heat was unbearable. Dozens of royal princes and princesses fanned into the room, looking for the Emperor, but he was nowhere to be found.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is impossible. How can he not be in here?&#x201D; Princess Taile peeked under the large royal bed, but saw nothing except dust. &#x201C;The door was barred and we had to break it down. Where would Father have gone?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He must have been here until recently,&#x201D; said Prince Zhuangchen, looking at the cauldron, his gaze calm and calculating. &#x201C;The fire was lit not an hour ago. Could he have left before we got here? Physician, you were here, were you not?&#x201D; His question was phrased accusingly, as if the physician could be guilty of some deception.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Impossible,&#x201D; said the physician nervously. &#x201C;I-I was in front of the door all this time! I never left! The guards could testify to that!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am afraid Father could not have left before we got here,&#x201D; said Prince Qi, looking more closely at the cauldron. &#x201C;Do you see how this boiled down? I know a bit of alchemy myself. The cauldron was probably lit no more than ten minutes ago. That means it was done while we were all outside.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It could be that Father heard us shouting and became annoyed,&#x201D; murmured Princess Taile. The royal siblings started muttering worriedly. They knew the Emperor tended to have a temper when he was interrupted with his alchemical work. &#x201C;Then where is he right now? That is the question, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; asked Prince Zhuangchen testily. &#x201C;Perhaps he went out of the window,&#x201D; ventured Prince Qi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is the third floor,&#x201D; sighed Prince Jiawu. &#x201C;At his age he would really have to be an immortal if he managed to pull that off.&#x201D; There was a deep silence as everyone in the room stared at him. They had all heard of the rumours. Prince Jiawu scowled back. He was feeling a growing sense of disquiet in the back of his head. &#x201C;A-anyway,&#x201D; he continued, trying to take charge of the situation, &#x201C;The windows are all closed. There would be no way for someone to close it if they had jumped out.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He tugged at his robes &#x2013; he was feeling rather hot. It looks like his siblings felt the same; the hot cauldron and that foul smoke coming from it was making the room very uncomfortable to be in. &#x201C;Let us order an all out search of the palace and retire to Lengchang Hall to discuss what happens next,&#x201D; he said. There were quick calls of agreement &#x2013; none of them wanted to be in the room any longer.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Prince Jiawu had always found the cool fans of Lengchang Hall soothing. He did not get to enjoy it for long, however. Scant minutes after all of them had arrived, a messenger ran in. The Emperor had been spotted. They instantly rushed out of the hall, to the front of Linde Palace. As he ran, Prince Jiawu found his steps unsteady. It must be the tension and the stress, he thought. It had been a long night after all, and he had had little rest this past month.<br>
<br>
His feet stopped. He looked up.<br>
<br>
That was the Emperor, floating in mid-air.<br>
<br>
There was no doubt about it &#x2013; though he could not make out every detail of the man&#x2019;s features in the night, he saw enough to be certain. He was in his royal robes, his hands outstretched.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;O sons and daughters of the wise Sage Emperor Taisheng!&#x201D; A beautiful female voice resounded around the courtyard, apparently coming from thin air. It was a voice that lodged itself firmly inside Prince Jiawu&#x2019;s skull, beguiling and attractive yet authoritative.  &#x201C;You are blessed indeed to witness this moment of your father&#x2019;s ascension.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is this? Who are you?&#x201D; Prince Qi called out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am the Queen Mother of the West, Xi Wangmu. I have been the patron of your father&#x2019;s research over the years, imparting the knowledge of immortality unto him. And now, forty nine days after he succeeded in synthesizing the Elixir of Life, his transformation is complete,&#x201D; declared the voice. &#x201C;Behold, descendants of Huang Di, the birth of a new immortal to join the celestial ranks!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There was a bright flash in the sky. Golden light flooded his sight. Prince Jiawu averted his eyes, pained from the glare. As it subsided, he saw that many of his siblings had fallen to their knees, kneeling before the strange sight. He found himself inexplicably doing the same. The voice continued, &#x201C;With the Emperor Taisheng&#x2019;s ascension, his earthly throne is now vacated. The Jade Emperor has decreed in his wisdom that the succession shall be performed in accordance to the laws of the dynasty and the express wishes of the great Taisheng. There will be no strife, only peace.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Prince Jiawu stared into the lights, trying to gather his thoughts properly. The atmosphere was overbearing &#x2013; he found it hard to think. Was this divine presence? He would not know, as he had never been in a god&#x2019;s presence before, but it had to be.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What does that mean?&#x201D; asks Princess Taile, looking up at the floating Emperor in confusion. The Emperor waved his hand across the gathered crowd in response and shook his head. The voice spoke, &#x201C;Emperor Taisheng has selected his heir years prior to his ascension. His name is known to the people, and he will be next to rule after his father. The Crown Prince Li Shun has now succeeded the Mandate of Heaven from his father, and will rule as wisely as his forebears had. Thus Heaven has decreed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But-&#x201C; Prince Zhuangchen attempted to speak out, but another flash of light sent him back to the ground, prostrating in front of the gods.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Will of Heaven is absolute and just,&#x201D; said the voice sweetly. &#x201C;Stay strong on the path of virtue, O sons and daughters of the Sage Emperor. Remember, the gods are always with you&#x2026;&#x201D; There was one last flash of golden light, brighter and more painful than any that had come before it, as the voice faded away. He thought he could almost see the visage of a beautiful heavenly maiden within that light. When Prince Jiawu recovered his sight, he saw the Emperor&#x2019;s robe fluttering down from the heavens. It fell, together with a clattering sound &#x2013; staggering to his feet, he saw a wooden tablet, inscribed with writing.<br>
<br>
The siblings got up, looking around in awed confusion. Prince Jiawu picked up the tablet and began to read from it, in full view of his siblings, the Grand Eunuchs, and a gathering of servants and guards.<br>
<br>
It was a divine mandate that declared the succession of the Crown Prince Li Shun to the throne of the Great Tang Empire.

            <h3>五十三 · Fall Into the Darkness</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fall Into the Darkness</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2019;The gods are always with you&#x2019;? Where did <i>that </i>come from?&#x201D; you laugh, helping Qilin down into the tunnels. The three secret police assigned to help you were moving ahead, guiding the way. She giggles. &#x201C;Hey, it worked, didn&#x2019;t it? Did you see Beardie&#x2019;s face when I started speaking? He seemed like he was about to start drooling.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Beardie &#x2013; ah, Prince Jiawu, that stinker,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I was paying more attention to the Grand Eunuchs. They all looked like they were about to keel over and die from the shock. Pity they didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; Qilin skips ahead, clearly in a good mood. &#x201C;Well, thank you, Xu Jing.&#x201D; She grins, giving you a demure bow. &#x201C;This is the most fun I&#x2019;ve had in ages. We should do it again sometime.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think once is quite enough, Miss Chi.&#x201D; Gao Ying steps out from a side passage smoothly, placing himself between you and Qilin. He plucks a torch from the wall, looking at you. &#x201C;I am pleased to see that you made it here with no trouble, but we should be going as soon as we can. This is not a successful plan yet.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you ever lighten up? Where is Cao&#x2019;er? And the Emperor?&#x201D; you ask &#x2013; Gao Ying is the only person you see. The eunuch&#x2019;s lips twitch slightly, apparently amused by something you said. &#x201C;They are waiting in front; I sent them slightly ahead to save time. Do not worry, they are safe. Come, let us hurry and join up with the others.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As Gao Ying turns away, Qilin falls back to walk by your side. &#x201C;Do you think he&#x2019;s going to kill us? Should I stab him in the back?&#x201D; she whispers. You wince at how boldly she is making the suggestion, before noticing that she&#x2019;s actually grinning at your discomfort. &#x201C;Stop fooling around,&#x201D; you hiss back.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;By the way, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Gao Ying calmly without turning around, &#x201C;Why did you suggest this plan?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You ask that only <i>now</i>?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am just curious. Your reasons would not have affected my decision to assist anyway.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well,&#x201D; you say, scratching your head, &#x201C;Shun wouldn&#x2019;t really want his father dead if there was any other way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You do realize the dangers of keeping Emperor Taisheng alive, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; says Gao Ying. &#x201C;If he should ever awaken&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He would find himself at Master Zhang&#x2019;s dinner table, probably dressed up in some strange outfit,&#x201D; you reply promptly. &#x201C;Yes, I did consider those consequences, but once we get him to Maniac Island it would not make a difference.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I agree.&#x201D; Gao Ying&#x2019;s answer surprises you for a moment. &#x201C;Once there it would not matter if he was dead or alive. Then is it not simpler to ensure he is just dead, instead of going all the way to Yinhu Island? For example, in these tunnels, any amount of accidents could happen&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What would you tell the Crown Prince, that his father slipped and cracked his head against a rock?&#x201D; you snap.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps,&#x201D; replies Gao Ying. &#x201C;He would see through me and understand the necessity of it. The Crown Prince is a wise man, a man far greater than you and I.  He is the only one who can bring order from this chaos the country is embroiled in.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He is still a man, Gao Ying. He has emotions. By nature he is as far from cruelty as I can imagine. If he has to murder his own father to take the throne it will kill his own heart.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is why he has me,&#x201D; says the eunuch fiercely. &#x201C;I work in the darkness while he walks in the light. I will do <i>whatever </i>is necessary to ensure the security of his rule. He does not need to know about the deeds I commit to keep him safe, and he will not ask. That is the understanding I have with His Highness. Can you say the same of yourself?&#x201D; You can feel the strength of Gao Ying&#x2019;s conviction from his words. It is a loyalty that is admirable, something that you had to respect. It is the loyalty of a tool, burning its own life up for the sake of its master. Something that you should have &#x2013; something you had&#x2026; but when did your feelings begin to change?<br>
<br>
Up ahead, you notice a group of flickering torches. As you approach, you see Cao&#x2019;er. She beams happily and runs to you. The Emperor is lying on a stretcher, looking dead to the world &#x2013; though with Cao&#x2019;er here, that is not likely at the moment. Gao Ying stops in his tracks, looking at the Emperor. Then, he shakes his head. &#x201C;You are a dangerous existence, Xu Jing,&#x201D; he says suddenly and softly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;ve been called that in bed, something I think you wouldn&#x2019;t have any experience with,&#x201D; you reply jovially. &#x201C;Oh? You&#x2019;ll have to show me after this,&#x201D; croons Qilin seductively into your ear, butting in where she is not needed. Gao Ying only laughs dryly. &#x201C;Your humour falls short of the mark today.&#x201D; He turns around to face you. &#x201C;You make the Crown Prince soft. Your presence endangers his capability to be a proper monarch. I fear that you will drag him into the morass of failure.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, that sounds rather threatening,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Please don&#x2019;t tell me you are going to say something stupid like, &#x2018;I have to kill you for the prince&#x2019;s sake&#x2019;, or anything like that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Gao Ying stares at you, silent. Then, he speaks.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
The sound of rattling chains disturbs the darkness.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well.&#x201D; You sigh. &#x201C;I guess this was going too well.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There is an unearthly moan, a weak and pathetic noise. Though it is soft, it echoes through the tunnels &#x2013; you have no idea where it is coming from. Every single person is frozen to the spot, wondering which way they should go. The sound resolves itself into words&#x2026; you can just about make out a name.<br>
<br>
Li Ming.<br>
<br>
Emperor Taisheng&#x2019;s name.<br>
<br>
As the moan dies off, it is replaced by another rattling of chains, louder this time.<br>
<br>
A strong, freezing wind blows forth, snuffing out the torches.<br>
<br>
Then, without warning, the screams begin. &#x201C;Cao&#x2019;er! Qilin!&#x201D; You shout out to the girls, trying to get to them in the darkness. You find Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s hand first and grab onto it, pulling her close to your side. She clings onto your arm immediately. You can barely make out a dreadful silhouette, blacker than the dark of the caves, tearing apart men with its long, lanky limbs. The stench of blood thickens in the air. &#x201C;Li&#x2026; Ming!&#x201D; it howls, striding for the Emperor. Suddenly, a burst of light fills the tunnels. The thing moans in pain, staggering back.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ha, I still had one of the light-making satchels left!&#x201D; exclaims Qilin exuberantly. &#x201C;Get the torches!&#x201D; shouts Gao Ying. The secret police retreat and begin lighting up the torches as they go. As the darkness recedes, you see the assailant shivering, panting in front of you. It is a man after all&#x2026; his hair is long and tangled, and his beard matted. A large, iron vest is clasped over his chest &#x2013; dozens of thick needles have pierced it through. His limbs appear to have been broken and set back together wrongly multiple times, healing in such a way that it must pain him even to move an inch. Heavy iron manacles shackle his wrists and ankles, and the rusty chains appear to lead down a side tunnel. Are they still attached to something?<br>
<br>
You had no more time to ponder, however, as he lets out a scream of fury. Gao Ying attacks immediately, striking with his fingers almost faster than you can see, but the madman blocks all of his attacks effortlessly, deflecting his blows as if he were toying with a slow child.  &#x201C;Take the Emperor and go!&#x201D; he shouts to his men. If he ever had wanted to kill the Emperor, he certainly does not have that inclination now &#x2013; it would be easy to leave the stretcher and let this strange person do the dirty work. As the secret police grab the Emperor and make a run for it, the madman screams the Emperor&#x2019;s name again, distracted.<br>
<br>
With a jerk of your fingers, you unleash the spider silk threads. The madman is still between you and the way out: with his overwhelming bloodthirst, there is no way for you to get past except to go on the attack. You throw them around the madman&#x2019;s neck and arms, pulling tightly. His arms are forced apart &#x2013; as he turns his face to you, you see to your horror that his eyes have been sewn shut and his nose cut off. Gao Ying does not waste any time &#x2013; drawing a dagger, he tries to plunge it into the man&#x2019;s neck, but the wind begins to blow again, colder and stronger. The torches flicker and die for the second time. You realize that the wind is flowing from the madman &#x2013; his <i>qi </i>must be immense. The eunuch is blown off his feet, his dagger clattering to the floor. The madman breaks the threads that have been said to be stronger than steel. Then, with a frustrated roar, he strikes the side of the tunnels.<br>
<br>
The earth shudders.<br>
<br>
Rock and dust begin falling from the tunnel ceiling as the supports tremble. This is bad. The ground shifts underneath your feet.<br>
<br>
There is a loud cracking noise as the floor falls away. The madman plummets first, a victim of his own mindless rage. In the darkness you find it hard to move, unable to find steady footing anywhere you go. You hear Qilin scream, her figure swallowed up by the darkness. You cannot tell if she is alright, but before you can even worry about her your feet find empty air.<br>
<br>
You drop, Cao&#x2019;er clinging onto you desperately like a baby monkey.<br>
<br>
As your hands scrabble desperately for purchase, you manage to grip onto a soft, sandy outcrop, which begins crumbling as soon as your fingers sink into it. The sudden stop jerks Cao&#x2019;er off. &#x201C;&#x2026;ah&#x2026;&#x201D;With a tiny yelp she begins to fall, but you react quickly and grab her arm before she is lost.<br>
<br>
Your grip begins to loosen. It is only a matter of time before you fall. Your feet try to find a surface to kick off but fail &#x2013; it seems that you are in a bad position.<br>
<br>
As your fingers finally close around nothing but loose soil, a hand seizes your wrist. In the gloom you are unable to see who it is.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing! Can you use your <i>qinggong</i> to climb up?&#x201D; It&#x2019;s Gao Ying&#x2026; the last person you would have expected.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No! I haven&#x2019;t learnt how to kick off thin air!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You can feel him straining, but after a while he says,&#x201C;&#x2026;You are too heavy. I cannot pull you up.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&apos;s two of us, eunuch. You should have trained your strength,&#x201D; you snarl. His grip begins to slip&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>With all your strength, you toss Cao&#x2019;er up, telling the eunuch to take care of her. The motion will likely result in your fall, but at least she should be safe. You&#x2019;ll just have to find a way out after you reach the bottom.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You let go of Gao Ying&#x2019;s hand. Knowing Cao&#x2019;er, she might actually decide to jump in after you and get hurt on the way down. It might be better for her if you shield her now as the both of you fall.

            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Underground Exploration</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Up you go!&#x201D; You swing Cao&#x2019;er up with all your might. As the girl&#x2019;s hand slips away, her fingers frantically try to catch yours. Gao Ying catches her quickly, understanding your intention. At the same time, your handhold falls away almost immediately, crumbling into nothingness. You plummet, shouting, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll come for you soon! Keep yourself safe until then!&#x201D; She cries out something in return but you cannot make out her words.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You pick yourself up from the ground, battered and bruised. The fall had been a terrible experience. It was only through your agility and instinct that you avoided having your head caved in on the way down &#x2013; the wind rushing past your ears changed subtly in tone whenever there was a dangerous rock headed your way. Looking up, you yell out to Cao&#x2019;er. Your shout echoes upwards and is smothered by the dark. You wait, but no response comes. Gao Ying might have dragged her away, or it is too far for your voice to reach her; you do not know which. You cannot even see where you fell from.<br>
<br>
The air is dusty from the collapse of the tunnels above, but cold and humid. You can hear the sound of running water far off in the distance. As your eyes become more accustomed to the dark, you see faint, glowing streaks of green light running along the walls. Going closer, you run your hands along the surface and take a closer look. It is moss &#x2013; a particular type you have read about before in one of the books that Master Yao burnt, as was his habit. Scraping the moss from the walls gently, you gather a small mound in one hand, casting just barely enough light for you to navigate by.<br>
<br>
Holding your hand out in front, you begin walking towards the water.<br>
<br>
You barely take a few steps before you step. In front of you you can barely make out the silhouettes of a a few people collapsed on the floor. You draw closer, allowing the pale glow of the moss to light up the bodies. The blood and entrails are dark in the green light; they are the agents that were killed by the madman just now. You wonder where he is&#x2026; it would probably be too much to hope that the fall killed him. At least you have not heard any rattling chains.<br>
<br>
Further ahead, you see a familiar outline.<br>
<br>
Qilin.<br>
<br>
You rush over to her side, taking care not to drop the moss. She is slumped over on the ground. You touch her shoulder and shake her gently. &#x201C;Hey,&#x201D; you whisper. &#x201C;Are you okay?&#x201D; She does not respond. Turning her over, you see that the side of her head is painted with blood. She might have hit her head somehow as she fell, causing her to land poorly. One of her legs is twisted at a bad angle and bleeding profusely. You talk to her again, trying to rouse her gently. Her lips part and close in a soft murmur, but her eyes do not open.<br>
<br>
You have no choice; you will have to stabilize her condition before you can move her anywhere. You gather more moss and place them on the ground to give you enough light to work by. Loosening Qilin&#x2019;s tunic, you expose her bare shoulders.  The pressure points next to her shoulder and neck would help stem the blood flowing from her head. Taking a deep breath, you hit those points quickly. She stirs slightly and moans, but does not awaken. You take off your outer tunic, tearing it into pieces for bandages. After wiping away the blood on her head, you wrap up the wound.<br>
<br>
Next, you turn your attention to her leg. You carefully cut away part of her trousers around the affected leg, baring it to the thigh. Wincing at the amount of work you would have to do, you run your fingers along her leg, examining it for any breaks in the bone. You find none, but the injury is serious nonetheless. You grit your teeth and get to work stopping the blood and bandaging the wound. After setting the limb properly, you lean back and let out a sigh. You know whatever you did was just a temporary measure; the best thing you can do right now is to find a way out before Qilin&#x2019;s condition deteriorates.<br>
<br>
You manage, with some difficulty, to tie the unconscious girl to your back. Scooping up the moss, you begin to make your way further in, always heading towards the sound of running water.<br>
<br>
After some time, you come to the source &#x2013; it turns out to be an underground waterfall running through a large cavern. You bend down, cupping up some water. The water is cold; probably drinkable. Massive amounts of moss are growing all over the walls of the cavern, lighting up the entire place with an eerie, greenish glow. A few ripples in the pond seem to indicate that there could be fish or other animals living within. At the far end of the stream, you see the entrance to another tunnel. You would have to cross the stream to continue exploring. You put your hands behind you, wrapping them around Qilin&#x2019;s waist to ensure she doesn&#x2019;t fall off. Taking a few steps back, you break into a sprint and leap. Your jump takes you across the stream; your feet skid against the wet, slippery rock as you make it to the other side, but you manage to keep yourself upright.<br>
<br>
The tunnel ends up being a long and winding path. Here and there you hear scuttling rats, but they do not appear in front of you.<br>
<br>
Finally, just as you were getting tired of the trek, you reach the end of the tunnel; it opens out into a large, circular chamber. You hold up the moss, examining the room with its light. The center of the chamber is dominated by a large boulder, wrapped around with thick chains. The top of the boulder is hollow; water has collected inside. Is the top of the chamber exposed to the elements? That is the only explanation you can think of right now &#x2013; that rain water is what has filled the boulder. Here and there you see piles of little bones and some larger ones mixed within. Rats, definitely&#x2026; but you wonder if those are human bones in the mix.<br>
<br>
Unlit torches are found mounted at regular intervals along the sides of the chamber; if you found a way of making fire, you could light them up. There is also writing covering nearly every surface of the walls, though the glow of the moss makes it difficult to decipher the words. It looks like they were written in blood, and the writing grows more erratic near one end of the wall. From what you could make out, it seems that these were instructions for martial arts techniques of some kind.<br>
<br>
You hear Qilin murmur softly behind you. You stop your investigation of the walls and immediately turn your attention to her. She does not seem to be feeling well &#x2013; you set her down and examine her quickly. The Miao girl is still out of it, but it looks like a fever has set in; her forehead is palpably warm under your hand.<br>
<br>
Since you are also tired out by the events of the day, it would be best to find a place to rest and recuperate, and soon. Further exploration can wait. It would be best for you to stay close to Qilin until she wakes up: you are not about to leave an unconscious girl lying around alone.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You return to the tunnels where you fell in and camp there. Though food and water will be scarce and the conditions are not ideal for Qilin&#x2019;s recuperation, if there is a search party that is probably the first place they will look.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You set up camp by the waterfall, an easy source of water. Although the air is wet and the rocks slippery, you could probably find food in the water; there are probably cave fish living within. As you do not know how long it would take for rescue to come, you need a more reliable food source.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You will remain in the chamber. The environment is more comfortable here despite the bones, and could help Qilin recover more quickly. You will also have more of an opportunity to study the writing on the walls. On the downside, you might have to eat rat for the time being if you should get hungry, and the water in the boulder is limited.

            <h3>五十五 · The Writing on the Wall</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Writing on the Wall</span></b><br>
<br>
The shadows in the chamber gradually grow lighter as you wait, bleary from the lack of sleep; looking up, you can see the barest hint of light far off in the distance. You can see your surroundings without needing the moss now, but even then the only light that filters down from the top is weak and sickly, giving you little to work with. There appears to be a mesh of some sort in the way, but at any rate it is far too high for you to reach even with your <i>qinggong</i>.<br>
<br>
Qilin awakens around what you conjecture to be midday, though the chamber is gloomy enough that you cannot be certain. She gives you a faint smile but otherwise remains uncharacteristically silent, too weak to even speak. Her fever has receded partially &#x2013; as you check her wounds for signs of infection, you are pleased to see that they seem to be healing well. Still, you are no miracle healer: if you are to estimate how long it would take for her to recover fully, you think it would take the better part of a week.<br>
<br>
By the time the light starts to recede again, you are feeling peckish. You hear a slight growl of a churning tummy. It is not yours; you turn to look at Qilin, who seems to be slightly ashamed. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have any food with me, unfortunately,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;We <i>are</i> going to need to eat, though.&#x201D; If you weaken and waste away down here from lack of food, escape is going to become near impossible. Qilin would also need to eat to regain her strength. Luckily, you are no stranger to living in the wilderness &#x2013; your time spent in the jungles of Maniac Island have taught you a thing or two about gourmet eating.<br>
<br>
You had heard rats moving around throughout the night; they should begin to start up their activity again soon. Holding still, you focus your senses outwards, relying on your ears and nose rather than your eye.<br>
<br>
It does not take long for you to pick up the characteristic squeaking and scuttling. You wait quietly for one rather brave and curious rat to venture closer to you.<br>
<br>
The moment it sets its paw within your range, you pounce. Bursting forward, you pin down the rat with one hand, trapping it underneath your palm. You scoop up the struggling rat, ignoring its furious squeaks, and with your other hand you wring its neck swiftly. The rat falls limp immediately, its legs twitching in the air. Drawing your dagger, you set about butchering it for its meat. The taste is bloody and raw, and not half as good as the animals you could find on Maniac Island, but it would do.<br>
<br>
Qilin looks at you with apprehensive eyes as you dangle a piece of rat flesh in front of her. She shakes her head weakly. It seems that the choice of diet aside, she is still too weak to chew, and the rat meat is too stringy to swallow whole either. It looks like you would have to find a safer way. &#x201C;Look,&#x201D; you say to Qilin reluctantly, scratching your head, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not like I want to do this, alright? I&#x2019;m just taking care of a patient, that&#x2019;s all. Don&#x2019;t struggle.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You pop the piece of rat into your mouth and chew it thoroughly, making sure to break it down properly. Then, you swiftly cup Qilin&#x2019;s chin with one hand, stretching her mouth open, and cover her lips with your own before she can push you away. She tries to protest wordlessly as you push the pre-chewed food into her mouth with your tongue. It would be easier for her to swallow the food that way. As you draw back, she involuntarily gulps down the rat meat. Her face has turned a bright red and her eyes are closed as she breathes heavily. &#x201C;I know you&#x2019;re not happy about it,&#x201D; you say apologetically, &#x201C;but I&#x2019;m going to have to do this until you get strong enough to eat by yourself.&#x201D; She does not respond, turning her head away from your sight.<br>
<br>
You decide to turn your attention to the bloody writing on the walls to occupy your time. They are divided into four parts &#x2013; the first three segments appear to detail martial arts techniques, while the last is a testament of some kind. The techniques are recorded in the form of poetry&#x2026; it would take you some time to understand and interpret them properly.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You pick one of the first three segments to begin deciphering:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>The segment that begins: &#x201C;In my youth my feet were as fast as lightning and as strong as thunder; therein lay my hope to rival the eight mountains.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>The segment that begins: &#x201C;In my prime I became the unsurpassed Conqueror&#x2019;s Spear; with spear in hand I pierced the heavens and split the mountains.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>The segment that begins: &#x201C;In my dotage the dark took me; the swooping claws of the bats in their hunt leave their mark both on me and my foes.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The last segment was a relatively straightforward account. As you read it, your heart felt ever more grim. It told you of the identity of the one who was imprisoned in this chamber, and likely the one who had seemed to bear so much grudge against the Emperor.<br>
<br>
If you had been in his position, you think that you would likely feel the same.<br>
<br>
As if on cue, you hear chains rattling the moment you finish reading the tale. You turn to look at the entrance of the chamber. The powerful madman is crouching there, half-hidden in the darkness, a body slung over his shoulder. From the clothes you identify the dead man as one of Gao Ying&#x2019;s agents. He throws the body to the ground &#x2013; to your disgust, it appears to have been partially eaten.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Cold&#x2026; dead flesh. That does not taste too good anymore? I like to eat them hot, warm. Warm&#x2026; is better,&#x201D; mutters the old man, his face swivelling in Qilin&#x2019;s direction. You move carefully but quickly, putting yourself in between her and the madman. His mutilated face distorts as he senses your movement. You shiver slightly as you remember the old man&#x2019;s tale, and whose blood he wrote it in. Steadying your feet against the ground, you take a stance, keeping yourself on guard. You can tell that he is strong&#x2026; perhaps stronger than your master, even.<br>
<br>
As expected, he attacks without warning, leaping at you with a hungry moan. As he whips his misshapen limbs around, the chains fly towards you. You realize now that they were not attached to anything: just extremely long. You take a quick hop, landing on the chains as they pass by and leaping off them. When you hit the ground, however, the old man is already there &#x2013; he seems to be able to read your movements almost perfectly despite not having any eyes. Hoping to throw him off guard, you shout out his name. &#x201C;General Yang Xue!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The old man does respond; he slows down for a second. That is enough for you.<br>
<br>
Twisting around, you lash out at his head with a well-timed Chuzhan Fist, launched with all of your strength.<br>
<br>
At least, at the very least, you could drive him back, and keep Qilin safe for a while longer.<br>
<br>
Before your fist can reach him, his chains wrap around your arm, immobilizing it with ease a bare inch away from his noseless face. With a cackle, the old man grabs your head with one hand and slams you into the ground hard enough to make you see stars. His spindly fingers close around your throat as he draws his head close &#x2013; the stink of his fetid breath causes you to gag. Then, he sinks his teeth into your shoulder. You grit your teeth to avoid shouting out from the pain.<br>
<br>
As you try to push him off, you realize that something is changing within you &#x2013; the old general is attempting to devour not just your flesh, but your internal strength; his fingers are pressed down where several of your important meridian points should be, in an attempt to open the floodgates. As your <i>qi </i>slowly ebbs away from your body, flowing into his, you find yourself able to manipulate your inner strength again&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>If he is trying to absorb your inner strength, you will try to absorb his. You attempt to counteract the flow of <i>qi </i>to the extent that his begins to flow into yours: due to Yuanshi Hundun&#x2019;s primordial nature, it should be possible for you to learn how to consume his energy in return and attempt to make it yours.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>If he wants your inner strength, he can take it: you unleash all of the energy you can muster, pouring it into the old man in an attempt to overload his meridians. Your proficiency at extending <i>qi </i>outside of your body will be tested and possibly pushed beyond its limits.

            <h3>五十六 · Chains in the Deep</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Chains in the Deep</span></b><br>
<br>
<i>I am Yang Xue of Zhejiang. I write this not out of hope but in despair. There is no longer anything left for me but madness. </i><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<i>I leave my techniques here, so that they will not be lost. They are all that I can impart from my days in the </i>jianghu<i>.</i><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<i>I am here in the depths, bound by chains, my trusty spear sealed underneath the rock, my </i>qi <i>suppressed by the needles that are locked into my pressure points. I have not been more helpless in all my life, but I will survive.</i><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<i>I will curse his name for every day I live. He considered me a traitor when I fled from the massacre he bid me commit, but I can not be loyal to such a man. I have found that the Tujue have proven to be more honourable than my people ever were.</i><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<i>I was told that it was for the good of the country. That the flow of the ley lines needed to be disturbed by a terrible calamity to bring about fortune and prosperity. I was willing to take on that role. But not like this.</i><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<i>I served him for thirty years. We grew up together as children, but adulthood has driven us apart. I do not know him anymore.</i><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<i>I wonder what has become of my children. I can only hope he has not gotten his hands on them. I entrusted my daughter to young Bulun, but&#x2026;</i><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<i>I remember that the man who I regarded as my sworn brother, my trusted liege, took away the woman I loved in front of my eyes. He violated her and made me watch, and with his own hands he sewed my eyes shut. He cut her and made me hear her scream, and with his own hands he sealed my ears. He raised her body to my lips and made me smell her death, and with his own hands he cut off my nose. </i><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<i>I will live, and escape, and make Li Ming pay for what he has done. He thinks he can leave me here to starve and rot and I will die, but he is mistaken. My dear Yumen had left behind herself as her final gift, the strength I needed to tear the chains from the boulder, and as the means by which I will record my words.</i><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Concentrating on the flow of your internal energy, you slowly but surely counteract Yang Xue&#x2019;s technique, reversing the ebb of <i>qi </i>and drawing it away from him. What he is doing comes almost trivially to you now that you are aware of it: using Yuanshi Hundun, you begin consuming his energy slowly, transforming whatever you can leech into your own chaotic <i>qi</i>. Before you can go any further, the old man realizes what is happening and breaks away, releasing his grip on you. You leap up, but a swift backhand from him sends you flying. You crash against the wall painfully and crumple to the ground. Even with your new understanding of your internal energy, there is no way you can defeat this man at your current strength.<br>
<br>
As you crawl to your feet, you see that Yang Xue has turned his attention back towards Qilin. She is awake, and is backing up against the walls. You quickly dart in, putting yourself in between her and the old man yet again. He stops, his posture utterly still.<br>
<br>
Tilting his head, the disfigured general lets out a long, terrible laugh that echoes off the walls. &#x201C;You&#x2026; care for this girl, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; he says, his voice hoarse from years of disuse. He seems rather more lucid now, compared to when you met him in the tunnels above.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not at all!&#x201D; you shout back, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s because I don&#x2019;t like you. I&#x2019;m just not letting you have the meal you want, old man.&#x201D; He arches his back backwards, a horrible grin on his face. &#x201C;Youngsters nowadays. You will see. Oh. A year or a month or a week later you will either die to save her, or her to save you. I will sit and watch which will happen. Food&#x2026; it tastes all the better if you wait for it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that all you have left, General?&#x201D; you ask, challenging the old man. &#x201C;Just the desire to eat? What about your vengeance?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He begins shaking violently. It takes a while for you to realize that Yang Xue is giggling silently. &#x201C;Of course&#x2026; not. I would rain down a storm of blood on the pugilistic world, if I could! I&#x2026; and&#x2026; Li Ming&#x2026; him too&#x2026;&#x201D; His brow furrows, his expression darkens, and you can feel the air beginning to swirl about the chamber. &#x201C;Why not escape together with us, then, General?&#x201D; you try, though you are not sure whether setting this mad man loose on the surface world is the brightest idea. Still, you do not think you can find a way out if he gets in your way. Yang Xue titters lightly. &#x201C;There is no way out. No way out of this madness. I do not need to leave anyway. I will wait for Li Ming to return and to kill him. He will be here one day. He cannot forget me. He cannot have forgotten me. No.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It sounds like he is a little too far gone to be easily reasoned with. As the old man continues muttering to himself, he wanders into the entrance passageway, half-concealed in the shadows. &#x201C;But there is one way out,&#x201D; he says, looking up. &#x201C;I can throw you up to the bottom of the bottomless pit. Haha. Bottom of the bottomless pit. In fact I can teach you everything, young one. Everything I know. You can be my spear, my weapon to strike at the twisted world of the <i>jianghu</i>. All I need is an offering.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let me guess,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;food?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, how did you know?&#x201D; chuckles Yang Xue.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just a hunch,&#x201D; you sigh. &#x201C;Do you need me to capture rats for you, old man?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Rats?&#x201D; he spits. &#x201C;Why would I want to eat that right now? You need to show your sincerity, youngster. An arm will do. Take it from the girl, it is not like she has any use for her limbs right now. It does&#x2026; more good inside my belly. More purpose. It is only right.&#x201D; You try to find some words in response to his ludicrous request, but as the chains rattle you realize the old man has already wandered off.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As you pondered what steps to take next, you took some time to master the fundamentals of the kicking technique that Yang Xue had inscribed on the walls. The name of the technique was Wuying Leipo Kick (&#x65E0;&#x5F71;&#x96F7;&#x7834;&#x811A;, Shadowless Thunder-Breaking Kick): true to its name, the moves were fast and powerful, reliant on strong, soaring leaps to attack the opponent with your legs in mid-air without touching ground even once.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, are we really going to have to give him an arm?&#x201D; asks Qilin. In the span of a week she has recovered on schedule, but the both of you were facing another problem. Yang Xue had been coming by and slaughtering the rats for his own consumption. He had made no moves to eat you or Qilin for now, apparently having forgotten his own words, but you were forced to fight him for rats whenever he arrived. Most of the time you lost, though sometimes you managed to steal a rat or two from the old man, to his screaming protests. He never ventured far into the chamber, however, preferring to just suck in the rats physically with his internal energy from afar. The first time you saw a squeaking rat flying through the air, drawn to the man&#x2019;s palm as if by magic, you could not believe your eyes.<br>
<br>
You had been left relatively unmolested besides that, but you could not find a way out no matter how hard you searched. The passages in the caves seemed to be endless &#x2013; you dared not venture too far lest you found yourself lost. At least you had managed to get a fire going in the chamber, making it a bit more hospitable.<br>
<br>
The fish in the waterfall cavern had been too difficult for you to catch in the end; it seems that the pool extends a lot deeper and further underground than you had expected, and any careless attempts to capture them would only send the fish hiding deep beyond your reach. The stream, however, must be flowing somewhere &#x2013; perhaps it would lead to the outside of the caverns eventually.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> You attempt to approach Yang Xue again for aid in leaving the caverns. If you submit to his request for an arm, whoever gives it would be too weak to escape, even if Yang Xue were to throw them up.<br>
<b>1. </b>You will sacrifice Qilin&#x2019;s arm, learn what you can from Yang Xue, and escape the cave. You will return for her later.<br>
<b>2. </b>You will sacrifice your own arm and ask to have Qilin escape. You will not have her die down here. Besides, you will then have plenty of time to absorb Yang Xue&#x2019;s knowledge.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You refuse to submit to the old man&#x2019;s mad request. There has to be a way out of here, since he managed to make it to the upper tunnels previously.<br>
<b>1. </b>You will just have to improve your rat-catching skills in order to survive; you will continue searching for a way out from the tunnels in the meantime.<br>
<b>2. </b>You will take the plunge and jump into the stream, allowing the flow to take you where it will and hoping for the best.

            <h3>五十七 · Cave Life</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cave Life</span></b><br>
<br>
Having decided to continue with your current approach and remain in the chamber, you find your gaze drawn to the writing on the wall at times, intrigued by the techniques that Yang Xue had devised.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You continue to practice the Wuying Leipo Kick, aiming to master as much of the technique as you possibly can. You feel that you might be able to completely learn all of the moves in the technique if you focus on it.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Wushuang Xiongba Spear (&#x7121;&#x96D9;&#x96C4;&#x9738;&#x69CD;, Unparalleled Manly Conqueror&#x2019;s Spear). The spear technique created by Yang Xue during his peak as the all-conquering General of the North, and reputed to be undefeated under heaven. It combines strength, speed and precision to unleash supreme thrusting power, allowing a master of the technique to pierce through any obstacles in his way, be it flesh, rock or metal.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Feian Bianfu Claws (&#x98DB;&#x6697;&#x8759;&#x8760;&#x722A;, Flying Dark Bat Claws). An aerial technique that imitates the hunt of the bat. It utilizes speed and knowledge of the enemy&#x2019;s blind spots to strike from above, swooping in with sharp claws to wound the enemy. Due to the speed and unnatural angles at which the attacks are launched, the technique is also highly risky for the wielder.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Now that Qilin has recovered, you begin to work together with her in an attempt to scavenge sufficient food for the both of you. The desperate situation you find yourself in forces you to improve very quickly in order to survive.<br>
<br>
<b>I. </b>You learn to create and lay traps for the rats using the spider-silk as well as other materials that you can scavenge. (Traps +4)<br>
<br>
<b>II. </b>By manipulating the spider-silk and practicing nimble trickery of the fingers, you learn better ways of feinting and capturing your target directly. (Sleight-of-Hand +4)<br>
<br>
<b>III. </b>You practice the use of thrown weapons, allowing you to hit the rats from a distance without spooking it. (Thrown Weapons +4)<br>
<br>
<b>IV. </b>You make use of your blade to attack your prey, learning how to strike more swiftly and precisely. (Sword +1)<br>
<br>
<b>V. </b>You attempt to go head-to-head with the mad old man, chasing him off with your bare hands and feet so that you may capture the rats undisturbed. (Unarmed +1)<br>
<br>
(<i>Pick two from the above.</i>)<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well!&#x201D; grins Qilin happily, &#x201C;That is quite a haul we have!&#x201D; The two of you had managed to obtain both fish and rat today. Bringing out a small knife, she deftly skins the animals, having gotten used to the strange diet quickly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll get the fire started,&#x201D; you say, going over to the small pit that you had dug in the ground. You had gathered pieces of damp wood that you found lying all over the caves and dried them out. Using flint taken from the remains of the Imperial agents, you managed to get a fire going. You had managed to scavenge a few dozen matches from their bodies, but the torches remained where they were on the walls &#x2013; you decided that you would save them for an emergency.<br>
<br>
You could hear Yang Xue screaming and ranting in the distance; after your first encounter, he seemed to have forgotten the offer he had made, treating the both of you as nothing more than potential food. Though he tried attacking you more than a few times during your struggles over the rat population, you were able to chase him off: the man did not make full use of his immense <i>qi </i>nor his formidable skills. Still, you are careful not to take his condition for granted. Just the other day you had approached him carelessly, thinking that he was deep in the grasp of senility. Unfortunately, he had been quite lucid at the time and laughed at you before launching his attack. You had nearly been killed by a thrust from his hand, and retreated into the chamber while he stood outside and cackled maniacally before slinking away with no rhyme or reason. The hole he made in the rock was still there, a reminder of the strength the old man still had.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going for a bath,&#x201D; remarks Qilin after the meal. &#x201C;You just had one yesterday,&#x201D; you reply, frowning at her. She smiles sweetly before saying, &#x201C;A lady must always be presentable. Come on, I need you to wash&#x2026; I mean, watch my back.&#x201D; Even if the both of you were cave-dwellers now, hygiene should not be neglected: as an apprentice physician you are only too aware of the dangers of not keeping yourself clean. It would be too risky to split up and go alone, however, so you and Qilin had decided that each of you would take turns guarding the other while they bathed.<br>
<br>
Grumbling, you lead the way out of the passage. &#x201C;Can you hear him?&#x201D; whispers Qilin. You shake your head. &#x201C;It should be clear. Let&#x2019;s hurry.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
When you reach the pool, you turn your back as Qilin undresses. Her pet snake, Xiaoqing, slithers out from the folded clothing and curls around your ankle. You hear Qilin sighing contentedly, starting to hum a traditional Miao tune as she slips into the cool water. &#x201C;I thought you would have taken this a little bit harder,&#x201D; you say &#x2013; she has been remarkably relaxed, considering the situation the both of you were in. &#x201C;Why should I?&#x201D; giggles the girl. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you find this rather nice?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s so nice about being stuck in a cave with a man-eating madman, with little hope of escape?&#x201D; It has been nearly four weeks and you had yet to find a way out: many of the tunnels that led upwards had turned out to end in nothing but collapsed rubble. &#x201C;Well, it feels a bit like married life,&#x201D; Qilin says teasingly. &#x201C;We hunt together, have dinner together, and go to bed together.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not so sure the heiress of the great and rich Wudu Cult would need to hunt to survive,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not so sure I prefer that life over this one,&#x201D; she replies lightly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What, are you rebelling against familial expectations?&#x201D; You grin, mocking her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not in the way you think, Xu Jing. They would be overjoyed if they knew the two of us had been trapped in a cave together, alone, for weeks. You would be forced to take responsibility for what you did to me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t do anything.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, really? You took my first kiss,&#x201D; says Qilin in a singsong voice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I never-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You violated my mouth with your tongue,&#x201D; she continues.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Look, I had to-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You really should be responsible and take the rest, while you&#x2019;re at it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You sigh. &#x201C;You know that&#x2019;s not what I meant.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, you are no fun at all when you are like this. Loosen up,&#x201D; she pouts. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m getting out.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You hear the water falling off of her body as she gets up from the pool. Then, you hear her clothes rustling. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m done,&#x201D; she says. You turn around. &#x201C;Well-&#x201C; Qilin is clearly not done at all, and the Miao girl smiles mischievously. &#x201C;Ha, I got you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You keep your gaze focused on her face, trying not to look anywhere else. &#x201C;So-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
She takes a step towards you with her bare feet, water still dripping off her wet frame. In the dim glow from the cave moss, she looks ethereal, as if she were a water fairy risen from a lagoon. &#x201C;I am quite confident in myself,&#x201D; she says quietly as she draws closer. For some reason, you are unable to move: your limbs refuse to heed your brain&#x2019;s command to leap back. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t see a reason for you to be unconfident,&#x201D; you reply, a nervous smile fixed on your face, though your mind is feeling rather scrambled by this sudden turn of events. &#x201C;Oh my, was that a compliment?&#x201D; she titters. &#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You shouldn&#x2019;t be doing this,&#x201D; is the next disjointed sentence that comes out of your mouth.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am here, trapped in a cave with someone I like, and death may just be around the corner. I would regret it if I <i>didn&#x2019;t </i>do this. I might not get another chance tomorrow,&#x201D; says Qilin unabashedly, kneeling in front of you. She takes a deep breath. &#x201C;Even then, it took me some time to work up the courage.&#x201D; You are suddenly very aware of her proximity, of the warmth radiating from her, and attempt to back away. Qilin frowns. &#x201C;Is it because of the Fire Cult&#x2019;s Holy Maiden?&#x201D; she asks suddenly. &#x201C;No, of course not,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;She has nothing to do with this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well then, good. Anyway, I am not averse to sharing, you know. I don&#x2019;t mind being second or even third.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I am sure your father would mind,&#x201D; you laugh nervously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, he wouldn&#x2019;t. He understands all too well that a man can have many wives&#x2026; or a woman many husbands,&#x201D; she says, glancing at you from under her long, graceful eyelashes. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m not like my mother.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This would be a mistake, Qilin,&#x201D; you say, trying to justify your refusal through the haze of increasing desire. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m the right sort of man for anyone-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It <i>really </i>is the Prince, then?&#x201D; She laughs as you shake your head, aghast. &#x201C;It is a mistake I am willing to make. Even if you cast me aside after this&#x2026; well, at least I can say I received something from you.&#x201D; Her smile is both teasing and coy at the same time as she looks down shyly, waiting for your response. You feel your ears burning: you must be blushing crimson at this moment, and you can see that Qilin&#x2019;s face is similarly red. She did say that she had to work up the courage to approach you like this. Your heart is beating wildly, as if it is about to burst its way out of your chest. If you make a mistake now, there will be no going back&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You make a mistake, consequences be damned. You&apos;ll just have to take responsibility and face down whatever difficulties that come next as a man should.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&#x2019;t make a mistake. Given the rather volatile nature of your life, you think it would be better for her if you kept her at arm&#x2019;s length in the long run. Getting too close to you will not bode well for her.

            <h3>五十八 · Light After Darkness</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Light After Darkness</span></b><br>
<br>
Qilin turns her head slightly, resting on your arm. In the waning light of the fire you see that she is smiling in her sleep. You are not sure if this was the right thing to do, but you feel strangely happy for some reason. As she wraps her arms around you, snuggling closer, you realize suddenly that she had left her clothes back by the waterfall, forgotten in the heat of the moment. You will have to fetch it when she wakes up, but you do not want to disturb her right now. Turning your head in the other direction, you find yourself face to face with Xiaoqing. The green snake is curled up comfortably an inch away from your nose, sleeping just like its mistress.<br>
<br>
Just then, you hear a faint scratching noise coming from above. Looking upwards, you see a small shadow silhouetted against the tiny circle of light high up in the distance. There is a clanging noise from that direction, and moments later a piece of a metal grate bounces off the boulder in the center of the chamber.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, wake up,&#x201D; you whisper, rocking Qilin&#x2019;s shoulder.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;Mmm&#x2026;do that thing with your tongue again&#x2026;&#x201D; comes a sleepy, strange response.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I can&#x2019;t believe- Not now, woman! We have company!&#x201D; you hiss, more urgently this time.<br>
<br>
With another shake, Qilin is fully awake, wrapping the patchwork blanket around herself as she looks around the chamber. You point upwards. Her eyes follow the line of her finger and she says, &#x201C;Is it help? I think we should still be careful anyway.&#x201D; You nod, agreeing with her. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re right. And in the worst case scenario&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A rope drops down from above, and a gleeful cackle realizes your fears.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue comes bounding into the chamber before you can reach the rope. &#x201C;There&#x2026; there is someone else coming from the bottom,&#x201D; he laughs. &#x201C;More people for me to see? Could it be him? Is Li Ming coming?&#x201D; You throw your outer coat around Qilin, who hastily covers herself. Her snake slithers up her legs and pokes its head out from her collar. &#x201C;Watch out!&#x201D; you shout, warning whoever it is coming down the rope.<br>
<br>
It is not a person that appears, however, but great bales of hay, smouldering at the ends. They catch fire as they hit the ground of the chamber. Yang Xue looks around, confused. Amongst the smoke, taking advantage of the distraction, a person slides down the rope, running towards you.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
The first thing she says as she comes up to you is &#x201C;&#x2026;you big stupid idiot!&#x201D; It is the loudest you have ever heard her speak&#x2026; though it is still not very loud. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; you shout, &#x201C;you&#x2019;re the idiot! Why are you here?&#x201D; Pushing her head down, you vault over Cao&#x2019;er, intercepting Yang Xue&#x2019;s outstretched arm with your foot. Just a second slower, and he&#x2019;d have taken her head off. The madman leaps back, giggling. &#x201C;You learnt it. You learnt the feet just by reading! That is smart of you, young one. Very smart. Why not stay and learn more? Just give me an arm from one of those girls. Maybe a leg.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, old master, but urgent matters bid me decline your kind offer,&#x201D; you respond. &#x201C;Besides, I&#x2019;m not too fond of staying in a burning house.&#x201D; He gives you an annoyed grunt and turns his withered head towards the rope.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ropes snap.&#x201D; He grabs the rope swiftly, planning to pull it down. Before he can do so, a dozen needles embed themselves in his hand and along his arm, flying down from above. Gao Ying appears, clinging onto the rope with one hand. &#x201C;What is taking you so long?&#x201D; he asks calmly. &#x201C;Hurry.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;More of Li Ming&#x2019;s dogs? Don&#x2019;t think for a second I will let any of you get out of here alive,&#x201D; says Yang Xue suddenly, his demeanour changing. He seems to be even more wild-eyed than usual, however, and his skin is turning an ugly purple where the needles had hit him. Poison: it might weaken him, even if it doesn&#x2019;t kill him. He lets go of the rope. The flames on the hay begin blowing towards him as the air in the chamber moves. As the smoke begins to obscure your vision, Cao&#x2019;er stands in front of you. &#x201C;&#x2026;I recognized the needle hole patterns on that vest. I can lock him down even more&#x2026; escape when he cannot move.&#x201D; So saying, she draws out six long, thin spikes from her clothes, three in each hand. She draws her arms back to make the throw, but with a shout Yang Xue raises his hands upwards. The ground trembles, shaking Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s footing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We need to keep him occupied!&#x201D; shouts Qilin, three throwing knives appearing in her hand. She tosses the knives at Yang Xue all at once. He swings his chains; the knives are trapped within the links and snapped with ease. You are already moving towards the mad man &#x2013; darting between the bundles of hay, you leap into the air once you are in range: you will use his own technique against him.<br>
<br>
Your foot cuts through the air, aiming for his temple while he is still distracted by Qilin&#x2019;s attack. Even without eyes he realizes what you are doing. His arm is raised to block well before your attack arrives. &#x201C;Using my own feet against me? Good! I will indulge you for five moves!&#x201D; gloats the madman. You land your kick squarely on his forearm. Leveraging your body&#x2019;s movement according to the Wuying Leipo technique, you use your position to push off from Yang Xue&#x2019;s block. You circle around in the air, gracefully turning your movement into another kick launched from the other side of his body. Yang Xue dodges with a laugh, leaning back just enough that your foot scrapes the side of his chin. You hook your leg backwards, striking into his chest with the back of your heel. He does not budge, but again you push off by using his body as a stepping stone. &#x201C;That is three moves!&#x201D; he shouts. You do not respond: you&#x2019;ll let someone else have the next move.<br>
<br>
Gao Ying steps in behind Yang Xue, silent and deadly. He throws up both his hands, jabbing at the sides of Yang Xue&#x2019;s neck, but with a roar the old man leaps into the air himself, evading the eunuch&#x2019;s attack. He lands with a kick that flings dirt and rock up into the air, leaving behind a hole in the ground: you recognize it as the Earth Splitting Lightning Descent from the Wuying Leipo Kick. When Yang Xue uses it, you can really believe that it could split the earth &#x2013; Gao Ying narrowly evaded the attack, saving his head from being crushed like a grape.<br>
<br>
You leap in for another attack, but suddenly find Yang Xue&#x2019;s hand in your way. He seizes your throat and picks up Gao Ying effortlessly with his other arm. Immediately, there is the ring of metal as another throwing knife comes flying at Yang Xue courtesy of Qilin. His head snaps back at the hit, and when he brings back forward he is grinning madly, having caught the blade by his teeth.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now!&#x201D; shouts Qilin. You nod. &#x201C;Got it!&#x201D; You remember the moves you practiced with her. The knives she had thrown earlier were attached to spider silk, as was the one she threw just now. You had been laying down a pattern with your movements through the air earlier with your own silk: now they intertwined with hers. The both of you pull at the threads, and they spring to life, creating an elaborate web from which he should not be able to escape.<br>
<br>
Of course, he would have no problems just breaking it&#x2026; which is why you had to act fast. Gao Ying thrusts another half dozen needles into the side of Yang Xue&#x2019;s face, causing the old man to shout in agony. Still he refuses to fall. &#x201C;Just how much poison am I going to need?&#x201D; he mutters in disbelief, before he is rewarded for his attack by being flung against the wall.<br>
<br>
You make use of the opening to drop to your feet and gain control over the massive web. Twitching your fingers, you shift the pattern to trap Yang Xue&#x2019;s limbs and neck, and you pull. Qilin too tugs at the silk on her end, further increasing the force exerted. The both of you yank at the threads with all your strength &#x2013; a normal person would probably have had their head, arms and legs severed at this point, but you were facing a monster. As the silk strings constrict around Yang Xue, you brace yourself. He pulls, causing your feet to drag across the ground. Even though you were using ten times the amount of silk you would normally use, you can feel the taut threads beginning to fray and snap.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er does not need to be told what to do. She sprints forward, stabbing the thick needles through some empty holes in the vest and into Yang Xue without hesitation and with the utmost precision. With a moan, the former general sink to his knees, his wild eyes suddenly losing their light.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Quick&#x2026;&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er, breathing heavily from the excitement, &#x201C;&#x2026;this might not hold him for long&#x2026; we need to go&#x2026;&#x201D; You do not need to be told <i>that </i>twice.<br>
<br>
Fleeing to the top of the rope, wondering if you were going to feel Yang Xue&#x2019;s spindly, bony fingers close around your ankle at any moment, you finally make it without any further incident. The moment you do, more bundles of smouldering hay are tossed into the hole. You collapse on the dirty ground. Even after making it all the way up here, it is still rather dim. Looking up, you see Li Shun and Xiahou Yu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Welcome back,&#x201D; smiles Shun.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What took you so long, Your Majesty?&#x201D; you grin.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As it turns out, the chamber lay further beneath what had been thought to be the bottom of the so-called bottomless pit. It had been known only to the former Emperor Taisheng and a few of his trusted secret police as well as the builders&#x2026; and none of them, save for the Emperor Taisheng, were alive anymore. It was only by going through a large pile of secret police records as well as his father&#x2019;s private notes &#x2013; one of the perks of being the new ruler &#x2013; that Shun managed to discover its existence, as well as its purpose.<br>
<br>
It seems that Emperor Taisheng had indeed forgotten about the man he imprisoned in the chamber. He recorded in his notes an account of the various punishments that he invoked upon that man in preparation for some sort of twisted Taoist immortality ritual that called for the sacrifice of a true and close friend, after the ritual was a failure he ceased to pay the prisoner any more attention.<br>
<br>
As the search in the now collapsed tunnels were not bearing any fruit, he decided to check the chamber out to confirm his suspicions.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, she jumped in before anyone could stop her,&#x201D; said Shun, apologizing for Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s dramatic entry. &#x201C;And after hearing the account of the encounter in the tunnels, it was my idea to use flaming hay to distract and frighten the old man,&#x201D; added Yu. &#x201C;I am sorry to hear it did not seem to work.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. I&apos;m just glad she wasn&apos;t hurt,&#x201D; you say, though Cao&#x2019;er had eventually become very interested in why Qilin was wearing nothing but your tunic and some rags. You had darted into Shun&#x2019;s office for a debriefing, but soon she would be coming to you with questions and demands, you are sure&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, how goes the Dragon Throne?&#x201D; you ask, changing the subject. Shun just shrugs. &#x201C;Not yet. I am recognized as the de facto Emperor, thanks to your great effort, but obligation demands I decree three months of celebration to commemorate my esteemed father&#x2019;s ascension to Heaven. My own coronation will only take place after that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure the people will enjoy the festivities,&#x201D; you say. Xiahou Yu nods. &#x201C;It will be a good chance to buy hearts and minds,&#x201D; he says. &quot;Generosity where it is needed is the mark of a good ruler.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah yes,&#x201D; says Shun suddenly, &#x201C;before I forget. Gao Ying?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, Your Majesty?&#x201D; The ever-present eunuch bows, his head kept low in front of his liege.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Deal with the chamber. Flood it, then collapse it, as safely as you can. I do not want anyone to ever see Yang Xue&#x2019;s treatise against my father, nor for anyone else to accidentally find out that he was kept alive in secret. That would go against the scenario that we have so painstakingly made a success by tainting his legacy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A very wise decision, Your Majesty. This thought process befits a man of your calibre,&#x201D; smiles the eunuch smoothly as he bows again. &#x201C;Your will be done. I will see to it immediately.&#x201D; He turns to leave, though not before casting you an expressionless glance. After he leaves the room, you lean back in your chair and sigh. &#x201C;Are you <i>sure </i>you can trust him, Shun?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would trust him with my own life on this,&#x201D; says your friend. &#x201C;He will make the best decisions for my path as Emperor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I agree with that opinion, Your Majesty. I think Gao Ying&#x2019;s loyalty to you is built upon the path of an effective and good Emperor, and so long as you embody that path his devotion is assured,&#x201D; opines Yu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, if even Advisor Xiahou says so...&#x201D; you shake your head.<br>
<br>
Xiahou Yu turns slightly red with embarrassment at your use of a title. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not really an official, Brother Jing. That was just what I thought.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun just laughs. &#x201C;Anyway, there is something else I wanted to talk to you about, Jing,&#x201D; he says with a wave of his hand. &#x201C;I have disbanded the secret police.&#x201D; You raise your eyebrows. &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t that risky?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ruling through fear and terror is not how an effective Emperor governs. My father gave the secret police too much leeway, and subsequently allowed the Grand Eunuchs to  make it their plaything. Now that I have wrested control of the department, I plan to make something better out of it,&#x201D; he says.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you have in mind, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A new, proper constabulary, answering directly to me. They will not operate cloaked in secrecy, but as emissaries of my authority, invested with the power to investigate crimes and bring offenders to trial and judgment regardless of their stature. Royalty, eunuch, minister, commoner, beggar, slave: all will be equal before them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Except you, Your Majesty,&#x201D; says Yu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, except me. Did you know, Jing, that your friend the scholar has been pressing me to allow this new department powers to investigate and censure the Emperor himself?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That would give the head of the department far, far too much power,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, it would,&#x201D; replies Yu, &#x201C;but if you want it to be truly impartial, there is no reason to exclude the Son of Heaven.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun grins. &#x201C;If it were any other Emperor you were talking to, you would have had your head chopped off by now, Xiahou Yu. But I do find your suggestions honest and worthy. What do you think, Jing?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why are you asking <i>me </i>this? Didn&#x2019;t you tell me to stay out of the politics?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I need someone I can trust, someone stupidly brave enough to right a Son of Heaven when he is on the wrong path <i>and </i>strong enough that he wouldn&apos;t die from all the abuse.&#x201D; He gives you a silly grin, causing you to flip a rude gesture at him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Grand Eunuchs would never stand for me in such a position of power,&#x201D; you say flatly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; nods Shun, &#x201C;but you don&#x2019;t need to be the head to keep an eye out for me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you ask Gao Ying to do it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He will have other roles to play,&#x201D; smiles Shun. &#x201C;As usual, I will not force anything upon you. I would hope that you accept my offer&#x2026; there are two more months to go till my coronation, and if you were to help me out until then, and beyond, it would be a relief.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Two more months. As far as you know, the Fire Cult Challenge appears to be just a week away; you are not even sure you can make it to Heihu Valley in time. Still&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You accept the offer. You will help Shun with building up a trustworthy constabulary. This will be a good way to restore your honour and reputation within the Imperial Palace, as well as to regain your position as his right-hand man.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You would prefer to keep your current position&#x2026; besides, you do have an appointment to keep at Heihu Valley. You decline the offer. Perhaps you may come back to it at a later time, but for now, there are other things you need to do.

            <h3>五十九 · Black Tiger Valley</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Black Tiger Valley</span></b><br>
<br>
On your way back to your quarters, you see Gao Ying in front of you. &#x201C;I am surprised. I thought you would have accepted His Majesty&#x2019;s offer,&#x201D; he says. You raise your shoulders in a shrug. &#x201C;Still haven&#x2019;t gotten in to filling in that hole, eunuch?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Gao Ying replies, &#x201C;Soon. The engineers need to be mobilized for some reconstruction&#x2026; I cannot do it with my bare hands after all. It is a good thing I have plenty of free time now that the secret police are being disbanded.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ha! I know him well enough, eunuch,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;I am not as smart as Shun or Yu, but I am not so stupid that I do not realize the stratagem of feigning foolishness while keeping your wits when I see it. It was telling when he did not offer you any position in the new constabulary.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;His Majesty just might not trust me enough to grant me any positions of power,&#x201D; demurs Gao Ying.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And again, I said I know him well enough. A virtue of a great ruler is in how he employs men,&#x201D; you reply. &#x201C;First make them believe he is an idealistic fool, then let them see the cracks in his camp. How are the preparations going?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Gao Ying smiles. &#x201C;Perfectly. Of course, Grand Eunuch Li is suspicious and smart enough to see through the ploy, if there was one.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Which would set him up for the second ploy, hidden behind the first. Let your enemies know your next move,&#x201D; you recite, recalling the treatises you once studied with Shun. You are sure Xiahou Yu knows them well too.  &#x201C;What would that be, the diffusion of your spies and informants in a network now free from secret police control?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not at liberty to say, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Gao Ying, still smiling.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t sound like it is going to be easy. I suspect that the Grand Eunuch will be starting to think two moves ahead, after that little show we put on.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Which merely means we will have to be three moves ahead.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You walk past the eunuch, smiling. &#x201C;Well then,&#x201D; you respond, &#x201C;the warrior will leave the handling of the emperor&#x2019;s political foes to the scholar and the eunuch.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A good decision. Your fight for His Majesty&#x2019;s continued success will be in other arenas,&#x201D; comes Gao Ying&#x2019;s reply from behind you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;By the way,&#x201D; you pause and ask, &#x201C;why did you try to save me from falling?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why, indeed.&#x201D; He lets out a little chuckle, and begins to walk away from you. &#x201C;His Majesty passed me a message before the mission began. That is all I will say. I am not yet convinced your influence on His Majesty is the wisest thing to keep around, but for now we are on the same side. Aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201D; His footsteps stop.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. We are,&#x201D; you answer, and continue on your way without looking back.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
By the fifth day, you knew you were never going to make it in time to Heihu Valley. On the seventh, still a day away from reaching the site of the challenge, you came across two panicked beggars.<br>
<br>
The news was not good. The Fire Temple had been more powerful than the Eight Sects expected. The battle between the Lord of the Temple and the Grand Taoist had drawn in another six heads of the Eight Sects, as well as five of the deadly Amesha Spenta warriors. A cliff had been brought down by the battle, and the combatants&#x2019; fate unknown, presumed dead: the beggars were running to send out the word to everyone about the result of the challenge.<br>
<br>
For now, the Fire Cult&#x2019;s contingent was retreating as the outcome had been beyond their expectations too, and the remaining orthodox fighters have rallied together under Bai Jiutian to pursue the cultists.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The top of the hill provides you a good vantage point from which you can observe the battle going on below. The orthodox pugilists had caught up with the Fire Cultists, and the fracas had devolved into a melee soon enough. &#x201C;&#x2026;I think I can get a better view if we climb up there, Jing,&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er, tugging at your sleeve as she points to the highest tree on the hill top. Seeing her, you can&#x2019;t help but redden slightly, remembering what she said to you back in the palace: &#x201C;&#x2026;I want the first time to come more naturally&#x2026; so I&#x2019;ll wait. It will be more&#x2026; memorable. When you are ready, Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are pretty sure Qilin had something to do with those strange words. You think the two of them are planning something, but you don&apos;t know what yet...<br>
<br>
Without asking for permission, Cao&#x2019;er leaps up and sits on your shoulders, her long legs swinging gently on either side of your face. &#x201C;Come on. Climb,&#x201D; she orders. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t fall now,&#x201D; waves Qilin, laughing as she sits under the tree, seemingly unconcerned with the battle raging below.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
At the top, it seems clear that the orthodox pugilists heavily outnumber the Fire Cultists. Cao&#x2019;er manages to spot several people known to you engaged in battle. You wonder if you should join in any particular fight&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Yunzi is fighting the Huashan Twins, and the flow of the fight appears rather even, with no side able to gain the advantage over the other for now.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Bai Jiutian is engaged with Vahista, and surprisingly holding his own, though the spokesperson of the Amesha Spenta appears to be gradually gaining the upper hand.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b> Guo Fu is cut off from his Wudang brothers, surrounded by more than fifty Fire Cult fighters and holding them off single-handedly. You do not know how long he can last.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>A group of Taishan and Kunlun disciples are easily beating back some junior Fire Cult fighters &#x2013; it looks like there may be some deaths involved soon.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You join the side of the orthodox pugilists.<br>
<b>2. </b>You join the side of the Fire Cult.<br>
<b>3. </b>You attack both sides, attempting to force them to stop their fight.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You stay out of it, preferring to just stand by and watch, waiting for the fights to resolve themselves and for matters to become less messy before you jump in.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When you come down from the tree, you see a surprising sight, putting your plans to join the fray on hold. &#x201C;Guess who&#x2019;s here?&#x201D; says Qilin, turning to you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are you doing here, Brother Xu?&#x201D; Murong Yandi gives you a pleased smile as he greets you. &#x201C;That should be my question! How have you been?&#x201D; You give him the traditional salute, open hand over closed fist.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m doing well, thank you. I assume you came for the challenge?&#x201D; he asks.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, but it seems that we are too late.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi nods sadly. &#x201C;I suppose so. My master hurried for no reason.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean&#x2026; the Sword Saint is here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi jerks his head over his shoulder, drawing your sight to the man standing behind him. The Sword Saint is watching the battle below, his hands folded behind him. He is younger than your master, an unkempt, rather bookish fellow with long hair left untied, falling down to his shoulders. His expression is mild and appears to be lost in daydreams, though some would call it serene.  A large, black sword is strapped to his back: the legendary Zhanlu Sword.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master, this is the Man Tiger Pig, Xu Jing,&#x201D; calls out Murong Yandi. The greatest swordsman in the world turns around, his eyes half-closed, and says, &#x201C;Hm?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you remember that I told you about him? The Southern Maniac&#x2019;s disciple?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He seems to become slightly more alert at the mention of your master. &#x201C;Ah, Jue&#x2019;s only surviving apprentice? I have heard of you. How fares your master?&#x201D; he says lazily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think he should be doing well, though last I heard he had sailed for Nippon,&#x201D; you say politely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That must be terrible,&#x201D; he says with a straight face. &#x201C;Well, in any case, he is not one to miss a fight. I am surprised he isn&#x2019;t here yet, but he should be soon.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are not sure whether that prediction is a good or bad thing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, Master Shangguan,&#x201D; you ask, &#x201C;are you planning on participating in the fight?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am yet undecided,&#x201D; says the Sword Saint simply. &#x201C;On one hand, the Fire Cult may be dangerous to the country, but on the other hand, I am not too sure if it is the righteous thing to do, to cut them down like this. Mercy to the defeated is the prerogative of the strong, after all. What do you think I should do, Yandi?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You should attack both sides,&#x201D; says Murong Yandi without hesitating.  &#x201C;With your strength, it would be possible to force them to stop fighting.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sounds like a bother,&#x201D; laughs the Sword Saint, before turning to you, Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;And what do <i>you</i> think I should do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;up to Jing&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Cao&#x2019;er as she looks away from the man, while Qilin just shakes her head. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just along because someone would be utterly incapable without my presence,&#x201D; she grins.<br>
<br>
You have already decided on what you would do, but what do you think the Sword Saint should do?<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You ask for him to intervene in the fight; you are interested in his strength, and he could be helpful.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&#x2019;t ask for him to intervene in the fight, preferring that he stay out of the battle.

            <h3>六十 · Return of the Taishan Heroes</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Return of the Taishan Heroes</span></b><br>
<br>
Trekking down the hill, you look back, up at the Sword Saint and his disciple. He waves you good luck; he wants to observe the battle a little longer before deciding what to do&#x2026; if he does anything at all. The man is already yawning. It seems that he is not too convinced that your decision to weigh in on the side of the Fire Cult will bear any significant fruit. Murong Yandi had argued to be allowed to intervene, but his master had held him back, too. He would have to watch from the hill for now.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Strange, I thought you would have gone for the fire girl from the start,&#x201D; quips Qilin. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter, getting shy?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She can handle herself,&#x201D; you say.&#x201D;I need to warm up on some orthodox prigs first.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Such trust! I&#x2019;m jealous.&#x201D; Qilin laughs, and moves closer to Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;Are we still going with that plan to reel in Number Three? I mean, I thought our darling here was going after her first, so&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You seem to be hearing something disturbing talk. &#x201C;Wait. What are you talking about? What Number Three?&#x201D; Qilin only gives you a smirk, her arm around Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201C;&#x2026;it&#x2019;s between us girls. You don&#x2019;t need to concern yourself with it. Go&#x2026; you have a fight to win&#x2026;&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er calmly, pointing ahead of you. She has become a lot more assertive with you lately, though you think it is warranted, given the amount of stress you put her through in the past month. Sighing, you shake your head. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t do anything stupid.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Look who&#x2019;s talking,&#x201D; retorts Qilin with a grin. &#x201C;Just go and have your fun, you idiot.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, yes, I hear you.&#x201D; Giving the girls a brief wave, you head down the steep approach to the battle, hopping from rock to rock.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The Fire Cultists under attack consist of a group of twelve nubile maidens; somehow Cao&#x2019;er had neglected to mention that particular point to you when recounting her observations. You do not recognize the fifteen or so Taishan and Kunlun fighters attacking the cultists: they are in their twenties, and you have never seen them before. You make the last leap just in time, throwing a string of silk around a raised sword-arm that is a moment away from striking. With a pull, you send the Taishan man sprawling to the ground in the perfect position to serve as your landing cushion. Your feet land on his back as he shouts in pain.<br>
<br>
You look around at the surprised combatants. The Taishan disciple below you tries to throw you off, but a stomp on his spine tames him quickly. &#x201C;I seem to have gotten a little lost,&#x201D; you grin embarassedly, giving the fighters a little bow. &#x201C;I was looking for the site of the Fire Temple challenge, but this doesn&#x2019;t seem to be that place, is it? It looks more like a hooligan&#x2019;s brawl than a proper match.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D; challenges a Kunlun fighter, shaking his staff in your face. &#x201C;Whoa, careful where you point that stick of yours, friend,&#x201D; you gasp, gently pushing away the pole to the side as you rock backwards on your heels, causing the man underneath you to groan in discomfort. &#x201C;The rules of the <i>jianghu</i> state that you should first introduce yourself before asking a fellow pugilist&#x2019;s name,&#x201D; you say, lecturing the Kunlun disciple. He frowns at you before taking a step back, calling out his name. You look to the side, at the frightened girls. &#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t seem very orthodox, attacking a bunch of defenseless girls like this, whatever your name is,&#x201D; you mutter. &#x201C;I just introduced myself!&#x201D; he shouts. &#x201C;These are evil cultists that ambushed and murdered our noble masters, and just <i>who are you</i>, you disrespectful bastard?&#x201D; demands the Kunlun fighter again. The other orthodox pugilists begin drawing closer, hostile intent in their eyes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, right. You did introduce yourself. I apologize, but I am bad with names. Especially if they are about to cease mattering in a while.&#x201D; You grin, spreading your arms out to your sides as you introduce yourself: &#x201C;I am Xu Jing, the Man Tiger Pig, disciple of the Southern Maniac.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The orthodox fighters take a synchronized step back, their faces turning pale. It looks like your reputation has not diminished in your absence. &#x201C;You! You are siding with these foreign cultists?&#x201D; snarls a female Taishan fighter. &#x201C;I thought that as heretical as your master Zhang Jue was, he would not have trained such a traitorous brat!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, should I side with you?&#x201D; You turn your head to the side, asking what appears to be the eldest girl of the cultist bunch. She gives you a confused look. One of the other girls whispers something in her ear, in a foreign language, and her eyes widen. &#x201C;Y-you are the Holy Maiden&#x2019;s&#x2026;&#x201D; she stammers. &#x201C;Yes, yes, please help us! We don&#x2019;t want to die here!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sounds great, that. I don&#x2019;t think anyone wants to die here. How grateful would you be?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; ah&#x2026;&#x201D; she blushes, uncertain. &#x201C;&#x2026;I would be very grateful, young master,&#x201D; she says shyly, looking down.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hold on, how grateful would <i>you </i>be if I helped you out instead?&#x201D; you grin, turning back to the female Taishan disciple. Her face goes red, but more out of anger. &#x201C;This is your duty as a fighter of the Central Plains. Gratefulness has nothing to do with it!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, that settles it.&#x201D; You sigh loudly. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t expect me to do anything else after hearing that, can you? Anyone who worships some foreign fire god, get behind me,&#x201D; you call out. As the cultist maidens make a run for it, you hop off the man you were standing on and give him a good kick, sending him back to his brethren. They hurry to catch him, allowing the girls to slip through their fingers. Folding your hands behind your back, you give the orthodox fighters an arrogant sneer, raising your eyebrows. &#x201C;What are you still waiting for?&#x201D; They respond with a roar, charging at you as one.<br>
<br>
You jump. Your first kick breaks the staff of a Kunlun fighter, sending the man flying. You step on his chest and push off in mid-air, soaring towards your next target. This time your kick is blocked successfully, but you move on to another opponent immediately as you continue your assault on the orthodox pugilists. The Taishan come at you with swords, the Kunlun with staves. You finally land on the ground &#x2013; six wooden staves rush towards your head from all directions, but you throw your hand up, swiftly weaving a web that catches half of them. With a shout, you pull, tugging it from your opponents&#x2019; hands with your superior strength and using the staves you captured to knock away the other half. You swing the three staves around wildly, smashing them into your opponents. Dropping the silk, you take advantage of the opening in their formation to launch an all-out assault with the Wuying Leipo Kick.<br>
<br>
You blow past the Taishan and Kunlun disciples like a powerful hurricane, leaving them broken and battered behind you. It is over in moments: your opponents had no counter for your kicks. Wuying Leipo Kick is probably a technique that has not been seen for decades in the <i>jianghu</i>. In the wild, furious exchange of blows you had understood that the fighters you were facing would be considered skilled in their own right, but they had failed to comprehend the relentless aerial assault you delivered and suffered for it.<br>
<br>
A few of them roll over, groaning in pain as they clutch their heads, while others remain unmoving, probably unconscious. You had held back in the attack, but out of concern for your own safety, you had not done so to the extent where they would not be heavily injured. In a fight like this, if you slowed down even a bit, the orthodox pugilists might have been able to turn the tide with a lucky hit.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Seniors! Oh no!&#x201D; comes a panicked shout. Seven pugilists dressed in Taishan robes come rushing in, followed by a young man dressed in Kunlun robes and wielding a particularly long staff. You vaguely remember the Taishan disciples. &#x201C;Seven Heroic Youths of Taishan? Or something like that, I presume,&#x201D; you say casually, dusting the dirt off your boots. They glare at you, united in hatred, but it is the Kunlun disciple that speaks. &#x201C;You must be Man Tiger Pig then,&#x201D; he says, his face serious. &#x201C;I am Su Liaojing of Kunlun. May I ask what you are doing here, and why you attacked our seniors?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just doing what everyone else is doing,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Attacking the weak.&#x201D; You give them a feral grin, but they do not shrink back. You can tell that though the fighters you just beat were their elders in age, that is not necessarily so in terms of strength.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The cultists poisoned the masters of the Eight Sects and then brought down the cliff as a means to sabotage the tournament. I do not think you are right to protect them,&#x201D; replies Su Liaojing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; You look over your shoulder, at the twelve girls huddled together in fear. &#x201C;When have I <i>ever </i>done anything right by the Eight Sects?&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;This should not come as a surprise.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed, it doesn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; he says calmly as he settles into a crouching combat stance that you do not recognize, his long staff held away from his body. He is remarkably composed; you don&#x2019;t think taunting him will give you any advantage in a fight, and you take your own stance as you curl your fingers into claws.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait, Brother Su,&#x201D; calls out one of the Taishan Youths&#x2026; you don&#x2019;t remember which number he is. One? Two? &#x201C;We have a bit of a debt to settle against Man Tiger Pig ourselves from the tournament. Can you leave him to us?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is just fine with me,&#x201D; replies Su Liaojing, though he remains in his stance. &#x201C;Are you confident?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;With our full Qixing Beitou Formation, Man Tiger Pig&#x2019;s defeat is assured before the fight even begins!&#x201D; boasts the Taishan disciple.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You call out Su Liaojing, saying that you will defeat him first before taking on the Taishan Seven. He is rumoured to be Kunlun&#x2019;s best young fighter, losing only to Yunzi in the tournament: you will see just how good he is.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You take on the famed Qixing Beitou Formation of the Taishan Sect. This is the most powerful technique they have to offer &#x2013; break the formation, and they can have no complaints about your strength.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Taking both these Taishan and Kunlun disciples on at once should not be impossible for you as you are right now. You will challenge Su Liaojing and the Big Dipper Formation simultaneously and prove your superiority over them.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You are not here for a fair fight. You make a surprise attack, trying to catch the Taishan disciples off guard and disabling as many of them as possible so that their seven-man formation cannot be performed at its full effectiveness.

            <h3>六十一 · Stand and Retreat</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Stand and Retreat</span></b><br>
<br>
You do not wait for the Taishan Seven to finish preparing. An explosive burst of speed brings you right in front of one of the Taishan disciples, before any of them have the presence of mind to react. Applying the Chuzhan Fist technique, you ground yourself, your feet digging into the dirt as you come to a sudden stop. Your strike throws the Taishan disciple an appreciable distance: you had held nothing back.<br>
<br>
That&#x2019;s one down.<br>
<br>
Crouching, you prepare to pounce on your next target before they realize what is going on.<br>
<br>
You sense movement in your periphery; whipping around swiftly, you raise your arm to guard. The tip of the metal stave crashes against your forearm: had you not wrapped it in the Wudu spider silk, it would have hurt. Badly. As it is, the force of the blow is enough to lift you off the ground. Your feet skim the ground as you skid backwards, trying to find proper footing. When you come to a halt, you see Su Liaojing in a low stance, his staff extended and held in one hand.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is not very sporting of you,&#x201D; he notes as the remaining six of the Taishan Seven cry out in horror, running to aid their fallen comrade. Trying to ignore the throbbing in your arm, you dust off your sleeve and grin. &#x201C;Fairness doesn&#x2019;t matter into it. This is a battle, not a duel. Besides, they said I would lose before the battle started. I just thought I would try to win before it started, in that case.&#x201D; The Kunlun disciple raises his eyebrows, and then nods. &#x201C;I see. Victory at all costs, eh?&#x201D; He straightens his posture and twirls the long staff before resting it over his shoulder. &#x201C;Leave this to me, Yizhi,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think  you can beat this person if you are disturbed from Qifu&#x2019;s defeat. Carry him away for treatment, then see if you can assist any of our other friends.&#x201D; Taishan One looks at Su, before turning his glare upon you. &#x201C;Alright, Brother Su. Beat this bastard up for us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As the Taishan disciples hurry away, you laugh, noting that the Fire Temple&apos;s maidens behind you are already taking the chance to back away to a safe distance. &#x201C;That is some confidence you have there. Were you hiding your true strength during the youth tournament? As I recall, you lost to the Fire Cult&#x2019;s Holy Maiden, who then lost to me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Su Liaojing just shrugs, his demeanour not the least bit shaken by your boast. &#x201C;In terms of physical ability  and <i>neigong </i>you are superior to me in every way, and your technical skill is no slouch. Even with the Ruyi Staff I am not confident of beating you in a duel. However, as you have just so aptly demonstrated, this is a battle, not a duel&#x2026; and a battle is not always about who is stronger, but how a person fights.&#x201D; He grips the long staff with both hands. You watch his stance intently &#x2013; the incredible reach of that staff is something you are not used to, though even he admitted that you are outright better. Su Liaojing of Kunlun shouldn&#x2019;t be too hard to defeat.<br>
<br>
It would take him some time to swing that staff of his, and since you managed to get to the first Taishan disciple before he intercepted you, you should be able to overwhelm him with your speed.<br>
<br>
Your body surges forward.<br>
<br>
He moves his staff up to block.<br>
<br>
You stop your movement, crouching even lower to the ground. He has been faked out, and the look on his face shows you that he knows it. His timing has been thrown off, and he is open for your attack. You dart forward, faster than before, under his guard.<br>
<br>
Drawing your arm back, you prepare to rake his legs out from under him.<br>
<br>
A strange-looking satchel falls in front of you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Careful, Xu Jing. You better block this,&#x201D; you hear Su Liaojing mutter, as he strikes the satchel with his staff with a dexterous spin. It was you who had fallen for a feint.<br>
<br>
You raise your arms up at his words, but it is not enough. There is a loud bang. A blinding light floods your sight. A wave of heat washes over you, hot enough to lightly singe your skin. As you stumble back, disoriented by the noise and light and heat, a powerful strike hits you right in the stomach, knocking all the wind out of you. A relentless rain of blows assaults you from all sides, giving you no time to recover. Then, you take another blow to the skull, strong enough to fell you. Your head is spinning as you crawl to your knees like a drunk. Unable to right yourself at all, you drop to the ground and roll over on your back. As your vision clears, you see Su Liaojing standing over you, his staff held high.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll knock you out, then tie you up somewhere safe where you cannot interfere, Man Tiger Pig. It&#x2019;ll be over quickly.&#x201D; Still groggy from his attack, you try to raise one arm weakly to defend yourself, but he shakes his head. &#x201C;Stay-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
He freezes up, his staff still raised over his head. You can see his eyes darting around frantically and muffled, choking noises crawling from his throat, but he is otherwise rooted to the spot, unable to move a muscle.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good thing a battle isn&#x2019;t strictly a one-on-one affair either,&#x201D; you wheeze, getting to your feet shakily. Cao&#x2019;er appears from behind Su Liaojing, scowling at you. &#x201C;&#x2026;you got careless.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I know,&#x201D; you sigh, shaking your head. &#x201C;Thanks for the save. I didn&#x2019;t think an orthodox pugilist would play such a trick, though that was a rather impressive toy&#x2026; Where&#x2019;s Qilin?&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er points ahead of her, a worried look on her face. &#x201C;We were attacked by the Fire Cult on our way here. She stayed back to let me escape.&#x201D; You clench your teeth and curse that idiot girl in your mind for adding more to your troubles. &#x201C;No time to waste,&#x201D; you say quickly. &#x201C;But before that&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You begin stripping Su, who has by now resigned himself to his humiliating fate and only stares blankly ahead. You find what you are looking for in no time. The word &#x2018;fire medicine&#x2019; is written neatly on the satchel, with instructions in small print. &#x201C;This should be useful,&#x201D; you say to yourself. &#x201C;Come on, let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The battle appears to have changed rather significantly; the combatants have separated and arrayed themselves into two camps, Fire Cult and Eight Sects. Shaolin and Emei have arrived, bringing with them three masters: the leaders of Huashan, Taishan and Kunlun. It looks like they were lucky enough to survive the fall. Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s grandmother and her friends from Wudang, Shaolin and the Beggar Sect are nowhere to be seen. On the other hand, two of the Fire Cult&#x2019;s Amesha Spenta appear to have made it out too. One of them is tending to a tall, wounded man in regal robes &#x2013; probably their lord, you think. You are not sure just exactly what has happened with the Eight Sects&apos; masters and the Fire Temple&apos;s Amesha Spenta, but that can wait. The other has a hand clamped firmly around Qilin&#x2019;s neck; a threatening posture, if you ever saw one.<br>
<br>
You see the Sword Saint positioned in between both camps, sitting on top of a fallen Vahista while making a suddenly servile Bai Jiutian pour him wine. His disciple is standing by him, looking uneasily at both sides.<br>
<br>
Angry shouts are being traded between the Fire Cult and the Eight Sects; you do not know why exactly the Fire Cult are holding Qilin as a hostage, but perhaps they think she can be a shield to cover their escape. You have no idea what the Sword Saint is thinking either, lounging around lazily in the middle of the field and drinking.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Can you hit the one holding Qilin with your needles from here?&#x201D; you ask Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No,&#x201D; she shakes her head. &#x201C;&#x2026;too far.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You see Nie Wuxing, the head of the Huashan Sect, walk past the Sword Saint, the both of them ignoring each other though the Huashan man gives the lazy swordsman a brief glance of disgust. Going closer to the Fire Cult lines, he draws his sword, holding it up in the air. The man holding Qilin hostage shoves her to the fore threateningly, but the master of Huashan does not even spare her a glance. Is he about to order an attack?<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You join the Sword Saint in the middle for a drink and attempt to distract both sides from their fight. Hopefully this will keep Qilin safe for a little while longer until you manage to think up a way to free her from the Amesha Spenta. It would be best if no one did anything stupid in the meanwhile.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You wait from a distance and see what happens. It would be too rash to go down there right now, hurting as you are. Surely the Sword Saint will not let anything bad happen? You will bide your time and try to rescue Qilin when you see a better opportunity.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You run in, appealing to the Fire Cult that you are not their enemy, that they have your friend in their hands, and that it is futile of them to keep Qilin hostage. Hopefully they will listen. You don&#x2019;t think that Nie Wuxing will stop just because some Wudu Cult girl is in danger: keeping her hostage is pointless.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>With the help of the fire medicine you just obtained, you will jump in and take back Qilin from their hands with a quick and speedy distraction. You don&#x2019;t trust anyone here, not the Fire Cult, nor the orthodox pugilists, nor even the Sword Saint. The only way to save her is by your own hands.

            <h3>六十二 · Scattered Wine</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Scattered Wine</span></b><br>
<br>
You feel everyone&#x2019;s eyes turn to you when you come out from your hiding place. Cao&#x2019;er follows behind you quietly as you walk towards the Sword Saint. He nods approvingly, raising his cup. &#x201C;Are you here for a drink too?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just one,&#x201D; you say, sitting on the ground without waiting to be asked. Turning to Bai Jiutian, you ask, &#x201C;What have you got on the menu?&#x201D; He just scowls, looking as if someone put a fresh, steaming pile of dung before him, but quietly pours you a cup of wine from the gourd anyway. Before he can hand it to you, Cao&#x2019;er deftly picks the cup from his hand instead. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll do the serving for Jing,&#x201D; she says flatly, handing the cup to you. Bai Jiutian shrugs, saying, &#x201C;Suit yourself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look at him, and then at his master, Nie Wuxing. Smiling at the man, you raise your cup politely and bow to him. The Huashan leader glares suspiciously at you before turning back to the adherents of the Fire Temple. He seems to be struggling with a decision. Then, surprisingly, he hurls his shining, golden sword down. It sticks into the ground, standing straight up. &#x201C;We will wait, then, evil cult! Face us when you are ready, you cowards!&#x201D; he shouts. Turning his back to the Fire Cult, Nie Wuxing walks back towards the Sword Saint and takes a seat, his face heavy with worry. You had expected to do some work to get him to back down, but it looks like the head of the Huashan Sect has caved in rather easily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose you are right, Chuji,&#x201D; he grumbles. &#x201C;Once their master reappeared there was no escape. If I order an attack now I lose either way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Furthermore, even if the others are in the dark, <i>you</i> know full well that she is the niece of the Western Snake, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; grins the Sword Saint. &#x201C;I doubt you want to be held responsible. Madam Nie will not be pleased if Chi Qilin dies here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What I don&#x2019;t get is why that girl appeared here in the first place, causing me no end of trouble!&#x201D; complains Nie Wuxing. The Sword Saint only glances at you. You shrug off Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s accusing stare. &#x201C;Yes, she was with me,&#x201D; you admit.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And who might you be, young one?&#x201D; he asks, his patience strained.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master, this is Xu Jing, the apprentice of the Southern Maniac,&#x201D; explains Bai Jiutian quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is right. Xu Jing, at your service. It is an honour to be in your presence.&#x201D; You bow your head. &#x201C;Thank you for the introduction, my good friend Jiutian.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His reply is acid, as the young Huashan disciple takes a drink of his own. &#x201C;Oh, think nothing of it, dear Man Tiger Pig. Everyone deserves to know your name.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, just my luck. Just my luck indeed. I have a debt of dishonour to settle with you,&#x201D; grimaces Nie Wuxing, &#x201C;but that will have to wait to see if any of us make it out from here alive in the first place.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You try to ask him what he means by that, but another voice drowns out your question.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is going on here, Brother Nie?&#x201D; Looking up, you see Song Lingshu and two other men coming towards you from the orthodox side. They seem to be the heads of Taishan and Kunlun. &#x201C;Su Cheng of Taishan, Liu Ye of Kunlun, Miss Song of Qingcheng, come. Come, sit and drink,&#x201D; calls out the Sword Saint. Perplexed, they sit down, joining the strange little impromptu banquet. Song Lingshu greets you and Bai Jiutian with a heavy smile. &#x201C;What is going on? I thought we were trying to negotiate a retreat?&#x201D; asks the Taishan Sect&#x2019;s head, Su Cheng.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The evil cult&#x2019;s master will not let us go without a fight, friend,&#x201D; says Nie Wuxing wearily. &#x201C;He continues to hold the girl hostage in order to pin us here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then I am afraid fighting is what we will have to do,&#x201D; sighs Su Cheng. &#x201C;It will be a great loss of face for us if we act and wilfully cause the girl to die as a result of our battle against the Cult.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That would not be just,&#x201D; insists Song Lingshu, stealing glances at you and Bai Jiutian as she says it. &#x201C;Qingcheng will not let our reputation be besmirched by putting the life of a single innocent above our own.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed,&#x201D; says Liu Ye. &#x201C;We, and our disciples, will be shamed by the world. Besides, we still have a chance of victory. The Temple Lord, powerful as he may be, must have been severely weakened by the efforts of the Grand Taoist Zhengchong and the other sect heads. This small risk to our lives is a small price to pay for saving an innocent girl.&#x201D; The Kunlun leader grins vacantly, though you can tell that he is nervous.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, you are right, Brother Liu. We can do this,&#x201D; mutters Nie Wuxing, looking down. He doesn&#x2019;t seem to have told them of Qilin&#x2019;s identity. Still, if it means that they are not going to make any rash moves while Qilin is a hostage, you are not going to complain. They fall quiet, each person looking down. Looking over at the Fire Cult&#x2019;s camp, you see that they are not making any moves either.<br>
<br>
After a while, you break the silence. &#x201C;I am curious, masters, what is going on here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who <i>are </i>you, boy?&#x201D; asks Su Cheng. Song Lingshu looks away uncomfortably.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is Zhang Jue&#x2019;s apprentice,&#x201D; replies Nie Wuxing. The two masters of Taishan and Kunlun leap up as one, their eyes wide with surprise. Shangguan Chuji laughs. &#x201C;Calm down, the two of you,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;He is not as like to his master, that he would try to tear your heads off to see how tough your necks are... I think.&#x201D; Again, you bow your head in respect to Su Cheng and Liu Ye. &#x201C;Please receive my humble greetings, masters.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right,&#x201D; coughs Liu Ye as the two of them return to their places. &#x201C;We certainly have more important things to deal with right now. As things stand, the Fire Cult are making us wait here until their lord is recovered enough to do battle. We fought them bravely at Heihu Cliff, but did not manage to finish him off.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Those foul cultists are holding a hostage in order to get us to do what they want,&#x201D; says Su Cheng, &#x201C;but as you can see, we are ready for them. We of the Eight Sects will not shy away from a fight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Chuji,&#x201D; asks Nie Wuxing, &#x201C;you will be on our side for this, won&#x2019;t you? Now that we have lost the elder heads of the Eight Sects, your aid will be sorely needed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Sword Saint gives Nie Wuxing an inscrutable stare. After what seems like a long pause, the Sword Saint finally nods. &#x201C;It is a pain, but I suppose so.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good,&#x201D; smiles the Huashan leader. &#x201C;With you on our side, I think we might have a chance against that monster.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not really, no. You are all going to die here.&#x201D; A deep, baritone voice rings out. Su Cheng drops his cup of wine; the porcelain shatters against the ground, spilling the wine into the soil. Opposite you, a tall, powerfully-built man in his thirties, dressed in ornate, priestly robes, is seated casually. His hair is closely cropped and there is a shining circlet around his forehead. A short beard decorates his strong jaw, and he is smiling calmly.<br>
<br>
When had he appeared?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, the Lord of the Fire Temple, I take it?&#x201D; asks the Sword Saint, unruffled by the man&#x2019;s sudden arrival.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. I am the earthly one blessed with carrying the name of Ahura as God&#x2019;s representative.&#x201D; He raises his hand, causing the other masters to draw back. &#x201C;Wine would be good.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, wine would be good,&#x201D; agrees the Sword Saint lazily as he looks over at Bai.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian pours him a cup, extremely reluctantly. As he moves to hand the cup over, Ahura grabs his hand and grins, staring at him. Song Lingshu winces, resisting the urge to jump up and help him. &#x201C;W-what is it?&#x201D; frowns Bai Jiutian, trying to keep his composure. After a while, Ahura says, &#x201C;Hm. Nothing. Thank you for the wine,&#x201D; before taking the cup and drinking from it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are all of you ready to fight, pugilists of the Central Plains?&#x201D; asks the Temple Lord, smiling as he looks each man in the eye with his fiery, magnetic gaze. &#x201C;Now that Wang Zhengchong is not here, all that is left to do is for you to accept your defeat. If you surrender now I will spare your disciples.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Keep on speaking, heathen,&#x201D; replies Nie Wuxing, his bravado having returned though whether it is a false front or not, you do not know. &#x201C;This place will be your tomb.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hold on for<i> just</i> a second, mighty Lord Ahura,&#x201D; you raise your hand with a show of meekness, interrupting the conversation before the inevitable violence breaks out. &#x201C;Since the hostage is of no more use, will she be let go?&#x201D; He looks at you, an amused expression on his face. &#x201C;No. She can still be of use in my dealings with her family. Besides, she is a rather fetching girl. I would make her one of my concubines.&#x201D; Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s brow furrows with added worry at Ahura&#x2019;s words, though the other masters do not seem to notice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But do not worry,&#x201D; continues the Temple Lord, &#x201C;she will not be harmed now. You have my word on that. Now you, on the other hand&#x2026;&#x201D; He stands up, towering over every other person present. &#x201C;My concubines have told me of you, Xu Jing. The Holy Maiden will never be free of impurity as long as you exist in her mind. I cannot have that. It is nothing personal, Xu Jing. I have the utmost respect for your skills, but you are not a necessary existence in the new world that the Temple will bring about.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You stand up, facing him. The other masters stare at the both of you wordlessly, while the Sword Saint just sighs as he downs the last of the wine in his cup.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh? You want<i> that</i> Yunzi to be pure in both mind and body, I guess?&#x201D; you laugh, your reverent tone fading with every word. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid that is not possible. She is so twisted I don&#x2019;t even know how to begin to explain it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have my ways of fixing that,&#x201D; says Ahura smoothly. &#x201C;The first step is to remove you from this world.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Lord of the Fire Temple claps his hands together. The ground trembles and the wind blows. A glowing halo of light appears at his back, a manifestation of his powerful <i>qi</i>. The other masters scramble to their feet, Nie Wuxing diving for his sword while Su Cheng and Liu Ye draw their weapons. Before you can drop into a fighting stance, Ahura appears right in front of you, traversing the intervening distance with a single step. He looks down at you with a sneer, weighing you down with the pressure of his full attention.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er squeaks in a panic. You feel your limbs becoming heavy: his strong <i>qi </i>is of an oppressive nature, and you struggle to shake it off.<br>
<br>
His fists blur.<br>
<br>
A dull metal clang resounds around the valley.<br>
<br>
Shangguan Chuji is standing by your side. His sword is unsheathed, the black blade positioned over your chest. The Temple Lord&#x2019;s fist is pressed against its surface, the dark metal glowing hot where his skin touches the blade. If the Sword Saint had not been here&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Swinging his arm, the Sword Saint bats Ahura away. Ahura lands lightly, his face calm and his arms spread out. The heads of Huashan, Taishan and Kunlun surround him, as do Bai Jiutian, Song Lingshu and Murong Yandi, standing further back. &#x201C;Very well, I will take care of you first,&#x201D; he says, pointing at the masters. Vahista crawls to his feet, having regained consciousness and ended his stint as the Sword Saint&#x2019;s stool. &#x201C;My lord,&#x201D; he says apologetically. &#x201C;Retreat,&#x201D; says Ahura. &#x201C;I will destroy these unbelievers here.&#x201D; He bows deeply and limps off.<br>
<br>
The rest of the fighters on both sides appear to have fallen back, content to watch the battle between their leaders play out for now.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You enter the fight on the side of the Eight Sects. They could always do with another hand, and you think it would be best if the Temple Lord is defeated here. Your tricks and attacks should be able to contribute to victory. Once the Fire Temple is demoralized by the loss of their leader, it will be easier for you to grab Qilin back.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>It seems that Ahura does not have any personal grudge against you despite his attack. Perhaps you can convince him it is all a misunderstanding about Yunzi and become his ally&#x2026; or &#x2018;ally&#x2019;, if that is what you are planning. You join the fight on his side.<br>
<b>1. </b>You jump in and fight besides him in the thick of things, helping the outnumbered Temple Lord against the Sword Saint and the three masters. Once they fall the battle will be decided.<br>
<b>2. </b>You surprise the younger fighters by attacking them from behind, preventing them from joining the fight on their elders&#x2019; side.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You take advantage of the fight to go after Qilin. Hopefully Ahura&#x2019;s words that she would not be harmed are the truth, or are still in effect even if someone tries to free her. You will use your sneaking skills to make as close an approach as you possibly can.<br>
<b>1. </b>You go alone. You should be able to manage it without any outside help, now that there is a distraction going on in the middle of the field.<br>
<b>2. </b>You ask Murong Yandi, Bai Jiutian and Song Lingshu for assistance, drawing them away from the fight. Asking only one or two of them would probably not yield any results, but having all three of them aiding you could make a difference.

            <h3>六十三 · Xsaora Vairya</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Xsaora Vairya</span></b><br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian had agreed readily enough: having heard what Ahura had said, and knowing his master&#x2019;s opinion on Qilin, he seemed to have come to the conclusion that rescuing her would free up the Eight Sects&#x2019; to retreat if the need arose. To him, it was a sound decision. The others did not need much convincing. Murong Yandi and Song Lingshu were eager to aid you by any means necessary.<br>
<br>
Their charge towards the cultists was the spark for an all-out battle. As the Fire Temple fighters rushed out to meet the three of them, the Qingcheng disciples surged forward to help their leader, Lingshu. The rest of the Eight Sects&#x2019; pugilists soon followed, Guo Fu thundering into the fray like a ferocious charging bull. You had not expected a full-scale fight to break out, but it served your purpose better this way. The Lord of the Fire Temple did not seem to care; or perhaps he could not, his attention fully occupied by the Sword Saint and the three Masters of Huashan, Taishan and Kunlun.<br>
<br>
As the battle between the Fire Cult and the Eight Sects&#x2019; resumed, you see Vahista and the female Amesha Spenta that had been healing Ahura join the melee. You had avoided getting bogged down in that fight, instead using it as a distraction. None of the other fighters could sneak well enough to get close without being found out, and had you marched in with the others it was not certain that you would manage to reach Qilin in time without anything else untoward happening. You would just have to hope they broke past the lines in time to assist you. Looking further, you see that Yunzi is not participating this time, guarded by some of her handmaidens as she stays back cautiously. <br>
<br>
That leaves the Amesha Spenta guarding Qilin. You recognize the man: he is the one who attacked you back at the Young Tigers Martial Arts Tournament, the fighter who had enough power to possibly rival your master. He seems impatient&#x2026; his eyes are filled with a hunger for battle, yet he has his orders to keep Qilin guarded. You wait for a while, wondering if the Amesha Spenta will finally get tired of waiting and abandon his watch to charge into the fight.<br>
<br>
No such luck.<br>
<br>
His devotion to his duty wins out, his expression settling into one of intense focus. Then, he suddenly turns his head, looking straight towards your hiding place. It looks like the Amesha Spenta is sharper than you had expected. No common fighter would have caught your presence.<br>
<br>
It looks like your choice is made for you &#x2013; Cao&#x2019;er stares at you and nods. You pat her on the head, and then leap out of your cover.<br>
<br>
Qilin looks surprised to see you appear. A vicious, eager grin spreads across the Amesha Spenta&#x2019;s face as you run towards him. &#x201C;Come!&#x201D; he growls, happy to see action. Still holding Qilin by her throat, he pushes her behind him protectively and raises his arm.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Qilin goes into a dead faint, her eyes rolling up in her head as she slumps limply. The Amesha Spenta shifts his eyes towards her just briefly, puzzled: he lets go of her throat quickly, wondering if he had perhaps squeezed too hard somehow, and she collapses to the ground without resistance.<br>
<br>
You give out a shout as you increase your speed, closing the remaining steps in the blink of an eye with a soaring leap.<br>
<br>
Swinging your body around in mid-air, you send a thunderous kick flying towards your opponent&#x2019;s temple.<br>
<br>
His arm moves into the way as he yells out a foreign curse. Your leg connects with it, limb against limb. The power behind your kick sends the surprised Amesha Spenta stumbling backwards a good few paces.<br>
<br>
Qilin is lying on the ground, unmoving, the momentum of your attack carrying you away from her side. As you land, you turn towards her, wondering if she is okay.<br>
<br>
That was probably not advisable.<br>
<br>
You snap back towards the Amesha Spenta just in time to see his palm rushing towards you. You meet it with your own palm, more by sheer instinct from your training with Master Zhang than any conscious thought.<br>
<br>
A fiery lance of pain shoots up your arm. Your feet skid back, digging into the ground, but you somehow find it in you to remain standing. Your <i>neigong </i>begins swallowing up the fiery <i>qi</i> that he is driving into your body, consuming it, but it is not a process that is fast enough to spare you the injury and the pain. Still, the sight of you holding your own is sufficient to make the man grin and retreat, his robes fluttering in his wake.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It looks like you have improved, filthy urchin that dared touch our Holy Maiden. This time you might even be worth a fight. What was your name again?&#x201D; he asks, pointing directly at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing,&#x201D; you say, raising your arms defiantly. &#x201C;It seems that you haven&#x2019;t been paying attention to the gossip in your little temple lately, if you haven&#x2019;t heard my name.&#x201D;  Your knees are still weak from that single blow of his that caught you off guard: you think Qilin is still down, but you realize that right now, having attracted the Amesha Spenta&#x2019;s notice, doing anything but giving the fight your undivided attention would be your doom. You would just have to trust Cao&#x2019;er to take care of things.<br>
<br>
The Amesha Spenta roars in laughter, his eyes gleaming with excitement. &#x201C;Gossip is for women and children. I pay such things no notice. I am Xsaora Vairya, the strongest warrior of the Amesha Spenta and the guardian of metal.&#x201D; He spreads his arms as he announces his name. Wisps of smoke appear to rise from his skin, slowly dissipating into the air. As he shrugs off the upper part of his robes, revealing a muscular physique that almost appears to be carved from iron, Vairya clenches his fists and takes a stance. You feel an intense killing intent emanate from the man, a bloodlust that is targeted at you, and you alone.<br>
<br>
His <i>qi </i>is not as oppressive and terrifying as that of Ahura&#x2019;s, but you can tell without a doubt that Vairya&#x2019;s strength could probably match that of Zhang Jue.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is the matter, urchin?  Do not wait,&#x201D; he taunts. &#x201C;There is no escape. Come! Fight!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He is right, in a way.<br>
<br>
If you are to engage him in battle, being overly concerned... being too frightened about your opponent&apos;s strength at this point would be a detriment.<br>
<br>
If you are to fight... you fight, with all of your strength, smarts and skill.<br>
<br>
Nothing else should matter.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You go all-out from the start, attacking aggressively with your Wuying Leipo Kick and Shouwang Claws. Your <i>neigong </i>should allow you to trade blows with him to a certain extent, and you will unleash the full array of your moves on him, giving him no respite. Your sheer ferocity will be the means by which you overwhelm your opponent.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You play it cautiously, taking a more defensive, countering stance. By mixing the use of spider-silk threads with your deceptive swordplay, as well as looking for chances to utilize the fire medicine satchel, you might be able to find or create an opening which you can exploit as you go for the kill with your blade.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You focus on talking to him instead of facing him in direct combat, playing keep away for as long as you can. You do not think words will work to the extent that he will let down his guard for your victory, but perhaps you can persuade him to stop fighting you and instead go after the Eight Sects&#x2019; fighters.

            <h3>六十四 · Battle&#039;s End</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Battle&#x2019;s End</span></b><br>
<br>
The moment you move, Vairya runs at you. It looks like he has no plans to be on the defensive either.<br>
<br>
The Amesha Spenta brings down his fist in an overhead swing, aiming directly for your head. You sway to the side, narrowly dodging his blow. The rush of air that follows his strike burns the side of your arm, but you ignore the pain. Your chaotic <i>neigong </i>guides your movement as you let it run free,  throwing your right arm forwards, your claw sweeping in an arc as you advance in a circular motion. Vairya knocks your blow aside with his palm and immediately follows up with a counter, bringing his fist upwards in an uppercut. You halt your advance, quickly raising one foot and bringing the flat of it down on the surface of his knuckles. Borrowing the force of his strike, you allow your body to go with the flow. You step off the punch, spinning as you transfer the momentum of the uppercut to launch a Returning Wind Spear at the side of his head. Vairya is surprised, but not for long: he intercepts your strike with his elbow, stopping it before it lands. Unlike the first time he blocked your kick, this time he does not budge an inch. A dull pain spreads from your leg; you feel as if you had just kicked an unyielding metal pole.<br>
<br>
Letting out a laugh of enjoyment, he grabs your shin and pulls you in. Vairya&#x2019;s iron fist rushes up to meet you. Gritting your teeth, you swiftly strike at the side of his arm with the first move of the Xianglong Palms, managing to nudge it away enough that he misses your chin by a hair&#x2019;s breadth. The eyepatch over your left eye is torn off and bursts into flames, lit up by the sheer power of the <i>qi </i>engulfing his fist. He would certainly have shattered your jaw if that hit had landed. Bringing up your free foot, you step on his chest, using it as leverage to raise your body. Drawing your arm back, you yell loudly as you execute the Bloody Diamond Horn. Grunting, Vairya shifts his body aside just in time to avoid being struck in the chest: your claws slam into his shoulder, causing him to release your leg. You feel your fingers dig into his flesh, but where your arm would have torn through a normal man&#x2019;s body, his skin remains unbroken. Clutching tightly, you swing yourself upwards by using his shoulder as a pivot. Gathering <i>qi </i>into your other hand, you unleash the second move of the Xianglong Palms &#x2013; the Sky-Soaring Dragon &#x2013; driving your palm right at his forehead.<br>
<br>
Vairya pulls his head back and snaps it forward with a shout, meeting your palm head-on. The force of your attack bends his knees, but they do not touch the ground. The skin on his forehead splits, blood trickling between his eyes&#x2026; a look of glee appears in his gaze. With a tremendous roar, he pushes you backwards as he rights his posture, the earth cracking beneath his feat. His <i>qi </i>surges forward, flinging you far up into the air. You feel blood well up between your lips: that attack of his inflicted considerable damage internally. Spitting out the blood, you see that the impatient Vairya has come after you, leaping high into the air to continue his assault. Raising your heel, you bring it down hard on your pursuer in the form of the Earth Splitting Lightning Descent. Vairya blocks it with both arms, but you manage to knock him back downwards, halting his momentum. You press your advantage: in an aerial fight, you are confident that you more agile.<br>
<br>
His fists and feet a blur, he exchanges blows with you furiously &#x2013; the Amesha Spenta&#x2019;s speed is easily a match for your own even when he is out of his element, and he is far stronger and hardier. You dart about your opponent in the air as the both of you fall back to the ground, relentlessly pressuring him with your kicks. Every attack you land, however, he blocks and counters; each strike of his tearing you up even if it merely grazes you. Even the crimson spider silk that you use for protection cannot stop his blows fully.<br>
<br>
This will not be enough.<br>
<br>
You release all of the silk wrapped around your body in mid-air, letting it float around you. Vairya pauses for just the briefest moment, surprised by their sudden appearance. Continuing to strike without pause, you entangle the Amesha Spenta partially in the threads, taking advantage of your superior mobility in the air. You do not think it will hold him at all, but if you could just strike at a speed fast enough, it would not matter. You concentrate, again summoning your <i>qi </i>to surge forth and flood your entire body without holding anything back.<br>
<br>
You unleash the most powerful move of the Wuying Leipo Kick, the Shadowless Thunder Breaker.<br>
<br>
The first kick hits, then the second.<br>
<br>
The third kick is strong enough to break the smoking threads binding Vairya. You follow up with the fourth, faster than you have ever moved. Then the fifth.<br>
<br>
He manages to block the sixth.<br>
<br>
But the seventh lands home before he can respond, striking him in the throat. The eighth plows into his stomach.<br>
<br>
Shouting, he pushes away the ninth. Stops the tenth. Grabs the eleventh kick. Squeezes hard with his iron grip.<br>
<br>
With all your might, you shout as you land the twelfth. His head snaps to the side as the both of you finally land, the power behind your kicks driving the Amesha Spenta into the ground with a loud bang.<br>
<br>
You roll away, trying to get to your feet. Your legs are trembling: assaulting Vairya&#x2019;s body with that level of power and speed is beyond your flesh&#x2019;s durability. You would not be surprised if the bones are already cracked&#x2026; your leg muscles are certainly screaming at you in protest now.<br>
<br>
Of course, it would be too much to hope for that attack to have brought down the guardian of metal.<br>
<br>
He gets up, dusting himself off. Here and there he is bleeding from superficial wounds, and his breathing is heavier than usual, but otherwise Vairya still appears in good shape. &#x201C;That was a good fight, Xu Jing,&#x201D; he says, standing upright. &#x201C;It would be impolite of me as a warrior if I did not  return the favour by showing my most powerful technique.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, no, there is no need,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;That is much more than I deserve.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I insist. This is a proper showdown between men! I must show you the respect due to a warrior of your caliber.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Vairya settles into a strange stance, an open left hand facing the sky, a closed right fist pointed towards the earth.<br>
<br>
Your heart beats painfully in your chest as you try not to fall to your knees: your instincts are screaming at you to run, but your legs refuse to move. Your vision begins to waver: you know that death is coming for you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Vairya!&#x201D; A girl&#x2019;s shout interrupts the Amesha Spenta. He relaxes, a slightly disgruntled look on his face. &#x201C;Holy Maiden,&#x201D; he says respectfully, &#x201C;you interfere at a most inopportune time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stand down, Xsaora Vairya. He is not the enemy,&#x201D; commands Yunzi forcefully as she runs towards the fallen Qilin followed by her handmaidens &#x2013; strangely enough, Cao&#x2019;er did not come to help her. You begin to feel worried.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He attacked us, did he not?&#x201D; asks Vairya, puzzled.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We were holding his friend hostage,&#x201D; she replies. &#x201C;You cannot blame him for his reaction. Would you not attack any man who would hold me by the throat? Xu Jing saved some of my handmaidens from certain death at the hands of the orthodox pugilists. He is not on their side.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a disappointed sigh, Vairya scratches his head, looking chastened. &#x201C;As you say, Holy Maiden.&#x201D; Yunzi kneels besides Qilin and begins to say something to you. &#x201C;Now, Xu-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
Qilin&#x2019;s hands dart up swiftly, catching her by surprise. In an instant, the Miao girl is behind Yunzi, her limbs entwined around the Holy Maiden almost like a snake capturing its prey. &#x201C;Hm, I was just waiting for this,&#x201D; smirks Qilin gleefully. Vairya roars in anger and steps forward, but his advance is halted by the sight of Qilin pressing a needle lightly under Yunzi&#x2019;s chin. The handmaidens move back in alarm. &#x201C;Ah ah ah, I wouldn&#x2019;t do that if I were you. This needle is poisoned, brave warrior. One poke and&#x2026; oops! Holy Maiden becomes a dead maiden.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You raise your eyebrows at Qilin, and she sticks her tongue out at you.<br>
<br>
Vairya suddenly snaps his eyes up. Waving his arm, he strikes at the air. A few long needles tumble to the ground, deflected by his blow. &#x201C;Who&#x2019;s there!&#x201D; he shouts. Cao&#x2019;er comes out of the bushes, looking rather annoyed. &#x201C;&#x2026;tch&#x2026; I missed&#x2026;&#x201D; she grumbles.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay, the plan should still go fine,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve already got Number Three in our hands, after all.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Number Three?&#x201D; snarls Yunzi as she tries to move her head away from the needle.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;m Number One, and you&#x2019;re Number Three. So you&#x2019;ll have to listen to me from now on, little sister,&#x201D; grins Qilin mischieviously. Then, she brings her lips close and nibbles Yunzi&#x2019;s ear gently, causing the Holy Maiden to gasp and turn red.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; uh&#x2026;&#x201D; For once, you do not really know what to say in this situation.<br>
<br>
Then, the world shifts.<br>
<br>
It is a strange feeling, as if you are falling through space while having your feet firmly planted on the ground at the same time.<br>
<br>
<i>Ah, boy. You are here too. Let me take this opportunity to show you the piece of the answer that you inspired me to seek. Watch.</i><br>
<br>
A familiar voice speaks briefly in your head. When you regain your wits, you find yourself standing besides Cao&#x2019;er and Qilin, Yunzi still in her grasp. Murong Yandi, Bai Jiutian, Song Lingshu and Guo Fu are close by, as are the Sword Saint and Nie Wuxing, Su Cheng and Liu Ye. In fact, every orthodox pugilist seems to have been gathered here, muttering in confusion&#x2026; and across of you, you see Vairya, Vahista and the rest of the Fire Cult. It is as if the two sides have been separated again in an instant, stopping further bloodshed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He shifted everyone to where they should be,&#x201D; says the Sword Saint matter-of-factly. Despite his carefree tone, he appears to be rather battered and bruised: it looks like the battle with Ahura had not been an easy one.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Look at the ground.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You do so, and notice some strange patterns carved into the ground. Following the lines with your eyes, you suddenly realize that they formed a massive symbol of the eight trigrams, encompassing the entire battlefield. And at the middle of the symbol stood an old man in Wudang robes, facing the Lord of the Fire Temple.<br>
<br>
The Grand Taoist is still alive.<br>
<br>
Ahura&#x2019;s face is pale at the sight of Wang Zhengchong.<br>
<br>
The Amesha Spenta leap into action to defend their lord.<br>
<br>
Vairya reaches the Grand Taoist first. His fist slams into the old man&#x2019;s face &#x2013; Wang had not even the time to dodge. Or so you thought: it instantly becomes clear that he had no need to dodge. The old Taoist&#x2019;s body moves in an undulating manner, his head slowly shifting backwards as his palm comes up. It barely touches Vairya in a gentle push, but he is flung away as if a giant log had smashed into him. When he lands, his eyes have rolled up in the back of his head, blood trickling from his mouth.<br>
<br>
Vahista and the female Amesha Spenta dart in different directions and flank the Grand Taoist, their expressions betraying their uncertainty even as they strike to kill. Without even looking to his sides, Wang reaches out and snatches their wrists, bringing them down with a single twist. He twirls them around as if they weighed nothing, sweeping the ground with the two as he spins in a full circle. Wang lets go, sending them flying off into the distance. He continues to advance towards Ahura. The Temple Lord is uncharacteristically rooted to the spot, a nervous look in his eyes. Both sides of the battle can only remain silent, watching the Grand Taoist&#x2019;s fight as if spellbound.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Classic Taiji,&#x201D; nods the Sword Saint in a satisfied manner.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Have you dueled the Grand Taoist before?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Once. I must say, I don&#x2019;t relish the thought of facing his Taiji Sword again. Too much trouble. It took me eleven thousand, six hundred and twenty five moves and three nights to defeat that technique, and had he actually decided to use something other than sword techniques in the duel I probably would not have won. That, and as an old man he lacks enough stamina to fight for three days without pausing.&#x201D; He pauses for a while, and shrugs. &#x201C;Actually, now that I think about it, it seemed more like he was instructing me and pushing my swordsmanship to further heights.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There is a sudden explosion of light. Gathering all of his power, Ahura moves to attack the Grand Taoist. You do not catch what happens next clearly, but it ends with the Fire Lord wreathed in flame, screaming as he is burned by his own fires. His arms and legs fall limp by his side as he collapses to the ground. Ahura crawls towards his adherents in pain, inching away from the Grand Taoist. His Amesha Spenta, regaining their consciousness, run to his aid and drag him to safety as Wang watches on.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Strange&#x2026; I did not know Taiji had such a move in its arsenal. He must have utterly destroyed Ahura&#x2019;s meridians with that attack,  but it should be impossible for him with Ahura&apos;s level of <i>qi</i>,&#x201D; mutters Shangguan Chuji, his hand on his chin. &#x201C;Wait. Something is not right. The Grand Taoist&#x2026;&#x201D; The Sword Saint looks slightly worried as he runs towards the unmoving Wang Zhengchong. You have a bad feeling about this.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let me go,&#x201D; whispers Yunzi angrily, still in Qilin&#x2019;s grasp. &#x201C;I need to help them. Please!&#x201D; You suddenly realize that having her with you, in the middle of the orthodox sects, might not be a good idea. They had been distracted by the Grand Taoist&#x2019;s sudden appearance, but soon they will realize the Fire Cult&apos;s Holy Maiden is here.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You keep Yunzi here: you will talk to the Eight Sects&#x2019; and try to convince them to spare Yunzi of any punishment afterwards.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will continue to keep Yunzi captive and run off with her before the orthodox sects realize anything. You will not let her go.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You release Yunzi. If that is where she wishes to be right now, you will escort her back safely to the cultists of the Fire Temple.

            <h3>六十五 · Parting and Reunion</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Parting and Reunion</span></b><br>
<br>
You give Cao&#x2019;er a nod. She goes up to Yunzi quietly and immobilizes her with a few expert jabs at her pressure points. Qilin arranges Yunzi over your back &#x2013; you wince at the added weight, but you aren&#x2019;t about to make the two girls carry Yunzi around &#x2013; and you leave quietly, while the orthodox sects are still distracted.<br>
<br>
Once you have gotten far enough, you let Yunzi down, dropping her on the grass. Cao&#x2019;er undoes her paralysis, leaving the Holy Maiden to glare up at you suspiciously. &#x201C;What are you planning?&#x201D; she demands.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your friends should pass by this area soon,&#x201D; you say, looking down. &#x201C;I acquiesce to your wishes, princess. Isn&#x2019;t that nice of me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re&#x2026; letting me go?&#x201D; Yunzi seems slightly surprised, but pleased.<br>
<br>
Qilin sighs, standing back. &#x201C;And to think I went to all that trouble&#x2026; Cao&apos;er will just have to use <i>that </i>on you instead. But I think she might actually prefer it this way, so we&apos;ll discuss this later tonight, dear. At <i>great </i>length.&#x201D; You gulp at the strangely gleeful tone in her voice and the disturbing things she is saying, but for now, you keep your focus on Yunzi. What happens later, happens.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Honestly, I would rather be sporting and make you fight for your freedom,&#x201D; you say, raising your fists mockingly, &#x201C;but I&#x2019;m in no condition to have a duel with you right now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I suppose you are right. That would be unfair,&#x201D; murmurs Yunzi as she gets up, stretching her limbs. &#x201C;I would beat you into the ground too easily.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>Thank you</i>,&#x201D; you say sarcastically. &#x201C;Just what do you plan on accomplishing when you return to the Fire Temple, though? Ahura is beaten and half of the Amesha Spenta are gone.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is precisely why I am needed. I can keep the followers together and give them hope. The Tufan prince may yet demand his due&#x2026; if I leave them now, who will speak for the temple?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A Tufan prince?&#x201D; Your voice is calm, your mind colder. If it concerned matters of the Empire&#x2026; The Tufan kingdom is the most dangerous and powerful of the fragmented states that rule over the Tibetan plateau. They have long harboured ambitions of hegemony, launching multiple invasions into Tang territory in the centuries past. &#x201C;Is that where the Temple&#x2019;s base is located?&#x201D; Yunzi nods. &#x201C;Destabilization,&#x201D; you murmur. In the previous Tujue War, the orthodox sects were a deciding factor in the eventual Tang victory. Any foreign power would be wise to find a way to subjugate them before performing a military invasion. You would have to find out more about Tufan&#x2019;s involvement in this and bring the matter to Shun&#x2019;s attention.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is no need to pay homage to the Tibetan,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I could always get-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No!&#x201D; interrupts Yunzi sharply, her eyes flashing with anger. &#x201C;You forget who I am. I have no love for your Emperor or your country. Or for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If that is how you want it to be, fine,&#x201D; you respond coldly, slightly angry at her words.  &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not like I care.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care either,&#x201D; she says, her coldness matching your own. She quickly turns away from you. &#x201C;A-anyway,&#x201D; she continues, a slight awkwardness in her voice as she struggles to find the words that she wants to say, &#x201C;the current site of our sacred temple is in the mountains west of Liangshan. If you ever are free, I think you could&#x2026; right, no&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, yes, my darling will accept your invitation to visit, Holy Maiden,&#x201D; Qilin says annoyedly, interrupting your talk with Yunzi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Does that invitation extend to me too?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You freeze up as a figure in white steps forward from the trees, smiling thinly. Bai Jiutian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Go,&#x201D; You wave at Yunzi. She nods, and murmurs, &#x201C;Right&#x2026; thank you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She runs off towards her followers, vanishing down the slope. You are prepared to intercept Bai Jiutian &#x2013; by throwing yourself bodily at him if need be &#x2013; but he makes no move to stop her. Seeing the look of mild surprise on your face, he shrugs. &#x201C;Do you expect me to chase after the Holy Maiden? Yes, I suppose that is what duty asks of me.&#x201D; He seems more relaxed and casual compared to your encounters with him during the tournament.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shirking your duty? Why, your master would be shocked if he knew his prized disciple was such a lazy ass,&#x201D; you mock.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No need for vulgarities here, Man Tiger Pig,&#x201D; says Bai Jiutian calmly. &#x201C;True, as an upstanding orthodox pugilist I should capture the evil fire witch and have her do penance for the crimes she has committed &#x2013; that is what my master would want, but&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I do not need to explain myself to you of all people &#x2013; I do believe we are not that close.&#x201D; His smile is gracious and kind, but it feels false and bitter to you. &#x201C;Now that I have seen what I came here to see, it is time for me to move on to the next item on my agenda.&#x201D; With one fluid movement the Huashan swordsman draws his blade from its scabbard, its beauty complementing his own. &#x201C;We have unfinished business from the tournament, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201D; Clenching your jaw, you take a stance. Does he plan to fight you here?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That business will have to remain unfinished for now, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201D; The Sword Saint joins the conversation, dropping down from a nearby tree with his disciple by his side. &#x201C;Master Shangguan,&#x201D; bows Bai Jiutian respectfully. &#x201C;I am glad to see you well: it was an eye-opener to see you fight side by side with my master.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Sword Saint snorts. &#x201C;Side by side? Somehow, I managed to take the brunt of the fighting. That&#x2019;s the last time I fight &#x2018;side by side&#x2019; with Brother Nie. Well, you should not miss your master&#x2019;s moment of glory. Better hop on back to his side.&#x201D; Bai frowns, then his eyes widen. &#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be-&#x201C; With a frown, he sheathes his sword, mumbling inaudibly to himself. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be seeing you around, Man Tiger Pig,&#x201D; he calls out over his shoulder, turning to leave.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What a strange person,&#x201D; comments Shangguan Chuji as he watches Bai Jiutian leave. You do not think he has room to say that about other people. &#x201C;So, what happened? How is the Grand Taoist doing?&#x201D; you ask the Sword Saint. He shakes his head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He did not make it. The old man&#x2019;s gone. The exertion was too much for him&#x2026;&#x201D; His voice drops, almost a whisper. &#x201C;I think he may have been poisoned, weakening him even before the fight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You recall the orthodox pugilists you fought saying something about that. &#x201C;The Fire Cult?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe. I don&#x2019;t know yet, and I have no proof of anything,&#x201D; mutters the Sword Saint darkly, the first time you have seen such a serious expression on his face. &#x201C;I also found Abbot Fangzhang, Abbess Miecao and Sect Leader Qi &#x2013; it looks like Taoist Zhengchong managed to haul them out. The Abbot has sadly passed away from his injuries. The Abbess is in a coma, tended to by her nuns.&#x201D; You look at Cao&#x2019;er, who is gripping your hand tightly. You squeeze back in a comforting gesture. You should definitely go to the Abbess with Cao&#x2019;er soon. The Sword Saint continues, &#x201C;Qi Liuwu lost both of his arms, but is otherwise doing well.&#x201D; You don&#x2019;t think you would call that &#x2018;doing well&#x2019;.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In the current circumstances, Su Cheng and Liu Ye pushed for Nie Wuxing to be named the next leader of the Eight Sects on the spot thanks to his brilliant leadership in pulling together the orthodox fighters in their darkest hour.&#x201D; The Sword Saint&#x2019;s tone is slightly mocking: you can tell that he does not agree.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So that is how it is,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is how it is,&#x201D; he nods. &#x201C;For the time being, I would advise you to stay away from the orthodox sects. Oh, and take this.&#x201D; He reaches into his robes and pulls out a tattered piece of cloth. &#x201C;Master,&#x201D; Murong Yandi exclaims, &#x201C;that is&#x2026; the Jueshi Wugong Sword Song!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have a good aptitude for swordplay, though you seem to have neglected its training.&#x201D; He tosses you the rag. &#x201C;Commit it to memory. It will increase your potential and help you master the sword more quickly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;...why?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Because you made the right decisions. Mostly, anyway,&#x201D; shrugs Shangguan. &#x201C;So, the faster you become stronger, the sooner I can retire and leave these troublesome pugilistic affairs to my disciple and to you.&#x201D; You laugh. &#x201C;Thank you, Master Shangguan,&#x201D; you say, looking at the cloth. It appears to be a poem or song of some sort. You memorize it, trying to comprehend its meaning. Watching you peer intently at the cloth, Murong Yandi speaks up. &#x201C;Master, maybe I could-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, Yandi. Let him figure it out on his own. Even a child who has never held a sword can comprehend the first step.&#x201D; You quickly finish committing the words to memory, confident that you can apply them in the training of your sword skills in the future. You return the cloth to Shangguan Chuji politely, thanking him again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good,&#x201D; he says quickly as he looks all around him. &quot;That took you a while.&quot; He seems to be hurrying all of a sudden&#x2026; you wonder why. &#x201C;Well, time waits for no man. I should be going. May we meet again, Xu Jing. Preferably without your master present.&#x201D; With a laugh, the Sword Saint and his disciple disappear into the trees as quickly and as mysteriously as they appeared. Still, one last thing remains to trouble you: Shangguan Chuji had predicted that your master would arrive to join in the battle, but he had not appeared. Was the Sword Saint wrong?<br>
<br>
Before you can go anywhere, a shadow falls over you. You feel that familiar, dominating presence, somehow even stronger than before.<br>
<br>
You turn around, looking up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Uh oh,&#x201D; says Qilin.<br>
<br>
Zhang Jue is standing there, a cruel smile on his lips. An eye-patch similar to your own lies across his right eye, and the number of scars covering his body seem to have multiplied. It looks like his travails abroad have not left him unmarked.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There you are, my foolish yet amusingly overachieving disciple,&#x201D; he grins. &quot;It is time for a test.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just your luck.<br>
<br>
You sigh. &#x201C;You are late, my master.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<br>

            <h3>一 · Maniac Training Part Two</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Maniac Training Part Two</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Jing&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er crawls over to you on her hands and feet, dressed in nothing but a gossamer-thin gown. Her gaze is intense; it transfixes you from underneath her long bangs. Your mouth feels very dry, and you gulp. She raises her hand&#x2026; she is holding something.<br>
<br>
Something wooden, of a very familiar shape, set on a wheel attached to a hand-crank. Cao&#x2019;er turns the crank. It goes round and round, and up and down. &#x201C;I spent that whole month we were apart&#x2026; just researching this&#x2026;&#x201D; She pauses and lets off a creepy giggle. &#x201C;&#x2026;I modeled it after yours.&#x201D; Breathing heavily, Cao&#x2019;er points her gadget at you. You try to back away, but you find yourself unable to move your limbs. The sheets fall away to reveal your nakedness, and you see that you have been bound with the spider silk in an elaborate pattern. Qilin drapes herself over your back, pressing her own body up against yours tightly. &#x201C;Do the ropes feel good?&#x201D; whispers Qilin seductively. She twitches her finger and the threads begin to bite into your skin gently, causing you to shiver.<br>
<br>
Still giggling, Cao&#x2019;er approaches you with that wooden horror of hers, turning the crank.<br>
<br>
Round and round.<br>
<br>
Up and down.<br>
<br>
In and out.<br>
<br>
You scream.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You open your eyes, sitting up with a start. Your clothes are wet with sweat&#x2026; you hope that is all that they are wet with. You are back in your room on Maniac Island. Standing up, you walk over to the window.  The island has changed a lot since you left it: the Minamoto have made it a much more lively and hospitable place to live in. Zhang Jue had knocked you out when he found you, and by the time you woke up, you were tied to the bottom of a carriage on its way south. Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er had been sent off to see what they could do for Abbess Miecao and Qi Liuwu, but apparently they had told Master Zhang that since he refused to take them with him, they would visit Maniac Island later to find you.<br>
<br>
You step out of the mansion, and into the garden. You see the former Emperor tending the plants caringly and happily, convinced that he is in paradise&#x2026; you cannot believe that this was the same man that tortured his greatest general over immortality. You had recounted your encounter with Yang Xue to Master Zhang, but strangely enough he seemed to be unconcerned about the whole affair, even when you told him of the techniques Yang Xue left behind; you had expected him to be interested in those, at least.<br>
<br>
A carrier dove flies overhead, reminding you that you had asked Yoriwaka to convey a message to Shun about the Tufan plot soon after your arrival. Your royal friend had replied that he would look into it. That would be his business to deal with, you suppose.<br>
<br>
For now, you had a test to take.<br>
<br>
Though, rather than a test, it felt more like an assignment. Master Zhang had tasked you with creating your own training regimen: it would take as long as you liked. If you wished, he had said, you could stay here for five years until you felt ready to leave the island. However, the both of you knew that the world would move on without you, and that you had other commitments you had to keep.<br>
<br>
In that way, it is a test: a test of how much time you are willing to give up to devote to training. For Master Zhang the answer would be simple &#x2013; he would devote as much time as was necessary, regardless of how the world turned&#x2026;  but he is asking for your answer, not his.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would have expected you to demand that I reach the same answer as you, Master,&#x201D; you said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are not me,&#x201D; he replied. &#x201C;Your adventures out in the world have showed me that much.&#x201D; He paused, before continuing. &#x201C;I encountered Wang Zhengchong shortly before he fought the Fire Temple&#x2019;s master.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You grinned. &#x201C;So that is why you are using this approach?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zhang only smiled sinisterly, looking down at you. &#x201C;Come to your own conclusions about the path you must take.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
That was yesterday. You look at the untamed jungle, wondering what you should do next.<br>
<br>
Then, you hear a shout from behind you. Turning, you see Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er running towards you, waving and smiling.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er is holding something&#x2026;<br>
<br>

            <h3>二 · The Fruit of Two Years</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Fruit of Two Years</span></b><br>
<br>
You lounge on one of the highest branches of the tall tree lazily, enjoying the cool breeze. This far south, the winters are temperate, far different from the biting cold of the north. It has been nearly two years since you returned to the island and devoted yourself to your training. You deserve a rest once in a while.<br>
<br>
The leaves sway in a different direction, and your eyes snap open.<br>
<br>
It is not the wind.<br>
<br>
Rolling over on the spot, you cling to the branch and peer down.<br>
<br>
Master Zhang is there, a jovial smile on his face. &#x201D;We have a guest. You should come back to the mansion.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Before you can get to your feet, he draws his arm back and drives it into the trunk with a tremendous shout.<br>
<br>
The tree, wide enough that you could barely put your arms around it, sways. There is a cracking, splintering sound as the wood breaks apart where your master had hit it. He is not waiting for it to hit the ground. As the tree begins to fall, its attraction to the earth slowly pulling it downwards, Zhang Jue leaps onto the trunk and begins running towards you.<br>
<br>
Keeping your balance easily, you raise yourself to a crouch and leap to meet him. The two of you exchange a few blows as a greeting move, trading and blocking claws and kicks.  Leveraging your higher position on the falling tree, you make a somersault, attempting to nail Zhang with an Earth Splitting Lightning Descent. A disdainful sneer crosses his face as he reads your move, grabbing your ankle before your heel crashes into his forehead. &#x201C;Try harder,&#x201D; he says simply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Whoa!&#x201D; You shout in alarm as he pushes you backwards roughly. It looks like he is going to smash you into the tree as it hits the ground; you do not think you want to take this sort of punishment just yet. You attempt a Floating Lightning, kicking your other foot into the air in an upwards thrust. Zhang narrowly evades your kick, leaning backwards while gripping tightly onto your ankle, but you have gotten into position. Standing on your hands, you use your Shouwang Claws to dig your fingers into the tree&#x2019;s trunk. You twist your torso, your claws still locked into the wood. The force you generate tears your fingers free of the trunk as you spin, and it is enough to make your master to let go of your leg.<br>
<br>
You jump away from the tree and Zhang as it crashes into the forest floor loudly. However, it seems like he has no intention of letting you go that easily, however. His claw smashes into your chest, as Zhang executes the Bloody Diamond Horn. You are flung backwards violently, only coming to a rest when your back meets another tree in a painful collision. You get to your feet quickly, gritting your teeth through the pain and spitting out the blood in your mouth. Just in time.<br>
<br>
Zhang throws another Bloody Diamond Horn at you, and you have no time except to respond with the same. Claw meets claw: the force of the impact pushes you back against the tree, but your arm holds even though you feel like it may shatter any moment. You pull back as soon as you can, weaving in a way that allows you to retaliate with the Elusive Claws of the Hidden Tiger before escalating to the Raging Claws. The surrounding greenery begins to get shredded from the force of the attacks as you battle your master.<br>
<br>
Even though your <i>qi</i>-absorption prevents you from growing tired with such rapid expenditure of energy, exchanging moves with Zhang like this can only lead to your defeat. You can feel him gradually cornering you with his superior skill, forcing you into an inevitable mistake.<br>
<br>
You shift up the pattern of your attack, mixing in the first move of the Xianglong Palms. Successfully nudging away Zhang&#x2019;s claws, you draw your wodao in a quick slash before returning it to its sheath. Zhang hops back with a  laugh and draws his own sword, one that he occasionally carries around.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, who is here, Master?&#x201D; you ask with your bloodied mouth, blocking his strike with the scabbard of your wodao. With one smooth movement you draw the curved sword and attack simultaneously, but Zhang shifts his body to one side with casual ease, allowing your slash to pass by him harmlessly. &#x201C;Go and see for yourself,&#x201D; he replies, retaliating with a merciless series of jabs that drive you back as you deflect his sword thrusts rapidly with the wodao, reining your <i>qi </i>in so that you do not make a fatal miss in your defense.<br>
<br>
The way to the mansion is, of course, behind him.<br>
<br>
With a grin, he presses the attack. Unable to find an easy opening, you crouch and spring towards him, the Yuchang Sword dropping from your sleeve into your hand. The sudden appearance of a second sword causes Zhang to miss half a beat as his instincts cause him to be on guard, and you take advantage of it without hesitation. You slash upwards, knocking away his sword. Pivoting on your feet, you swing around and cut at him with the wodao in your other hand. &#x201C;Ha, that is too na&#xEF;ve!&#x201D; he laughs. He raises his elbow and drives it down on the blade of your sword before it reaches him. As you lose your balance, you see his sword coming towards you, filled with killing intent. You kick off the ground, turning your fall into a spin that carries you away from Zhang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Come on, master, give me a break,&#x201D; you complain. As you try to regain your balance, Zhang charges at you. You make a clumsy strike with the Yuchang Sword to ward him off, but it falls short. Zhang grabs the advantage as he swings, and you twirl the short blade. &#x201C;The Deceptive Fish Stab?&#x201D; he grins, angling his sword to push aside the second thrust that was meant to hit him as he falls for the feint. &#x201C;You are too smart, Master,&#x201D; you say, as his stab knocks away your Yuchang Sword and comes straight for your chest. Then, he notices it all too late: the second feint, used to hide your sheathing of the wodao.  You focus, and at the last possible second, draw your blade. Committed to the attack, even Zhang Jue will find it hard to retract his move. The curved sword slices through the air and towards your master&#x2019;s arm.<br>
<br>
If he does not block it, you could cut it clean off.<br>
<br>
He does.<br>
<br>
Somehow, your master manages to maneuver his sword back into a defensive position, shouting from the effort. The force of your blow knocks the sword from his hand, but for now he is safe. Before you can recover from your move, he reaches out and traps the wodao between his arm and body.<br>
<br>
Realizing your peril, you instinctively let go of the sword, but it is too late.<br>
<br>
You see him visibly breathe in. Too late, you realize the technique he is about to use: one of the moves that he perfected abroad.<br>
<br>
Zhang Jue shouts &#x2013; no, roars to the heavens so loudly that you cannot do anything but freeze up; you can almost imagine it is loud enough to be heard on the mainland. A powerful wave of pressure blasts you away at the same time. The last time he did it, he collapsed the Minamoto village. The Xiongshi Violent Roar (&#x96C4;&#x72EE;&#x66B4;&#x543C;, Manly Lion&#x2019;s Violent Roar) was a technique you had yet to find a proper counter for.<br>
<br>
 You sink to your knees, your ears ringing and your legs numb from the sonic assault even as dead birds drop to the ground around you.<br>
<br>
Perhaps one day they will learn to fly around the island.<br>
<br>
As Zhang walks towards you, you force yourself back to your feet, the both of you grinning at each other. The light sparring isn&#x2019;t over yet.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You stagger into the main hall of the mansion, bloodied from your beating by Zhang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just returned from your daily exercise?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Chi Tianxie is sitting there drinking tea. You nod, wobbling your way over to a chair and dropping into it with a groan. &#x201C;So,&#x201D; you begin, &#x201C;I suppose you are the guest that my master spoke of?&#x201D; He nods, confirming your words.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did you come to see Qilin?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
He grins affably.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I came for you. You see, I was wondering just how long you were going to drag this whole situation out.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You understand which situation he is talking about, and gulp nervously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, no, there is no rush,&#x201D; he laughs, trying to calm you down. &#x201C;It is just that, as a father, I would be more at ease if I knew when the two of you plan to settle down and give me some grandchildren.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Dad!&#x201D; Qilin enters the hall carrying a tub of water, frowning at her father. She has taken to tying her hair up in a pony-tail nowadays. &#x201C;I have told you many times that both of us aren&#x2019;t ready yet,&#x201D; she says, admonishing Chi Tianxie. Turning to you, she sets the tub down, picking up the cloth floating inside and wringing it. She begins to tenderly minister to your wounds.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alright, marriage is one thing, it&#x2019;s just a ceremony, but where are the grandchildren after two years? What is wrong? Is Jing impotent? Are there any problems there?&#x201D; Chi Tianxie asks his questions quickly with what seems to be genuine concern, but it causes Qilin to press down hard on your wounds as she suddenly turns red. It amazes you, considering how forward she is at other times.<br>
<br>
You and Qilin spend the rest of the day explaining to an unconvinced Chi Tianxie of the precautions you take and why, but it seems that his patience is slowly starting to wear thin, regardless of what he says&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s make a run for it,&#x201D; says an annoyed Qilin later that night. &#x201C;If we stay here, he&#x2019;s going to keep pestering us. Your training is complete, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod. &#x201C;Yes, I was planning to leave in the next week or so anyway.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;where will we be going?&#x201D; asks Cao&#x2019;er, looking up from her books.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hah,&#x201D; snorts Qilin, &#x201C;there is only one place our darling here is going to go right after he gets his freedom. We&#x2019;re going to visit the Holy Maiden, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I <i>am </i>concerned about the Fire Temple,&#x201D; you say, looking away from her. &#x201C;Shun is still keeping an eye on the Tufan, but it appears as if they have not made any major moves in the past two years.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, you are so cute when you lie,&#x201D; she grins, putting her arms around you. &#x201C;Well, no matter. I will just get my fill of you while I don&#x2019;t have to share you with even more women&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You do not get much sleep that night.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The Fire Temple of Gushnap is located near the Tang-Tufan border, high up in the mountains. With the instructions given by Yunzi, you had little trouble locating the place&#x2026; though you wonder if she is still there.<br>
<br>
When you arrive, you find a place more akin to a fortress than a temple, surrounded by many village houses. The gates are open, but guarded.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who goes there?&#x201D;  The guard appears to be of Han origin. You gesture to Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er to stay where they are, wrapped in their thick clothing, and approach the guard.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am a pilgrim, sir,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I wanted to visit the Great Fire Temple of Gushnap, so that I may worship at the fire&#x2019;s glory.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The guard stares at you a while before saying, &#x201C;Lord Vairya has ordered that worship services are temporarily closed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why is that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He frowns at being asked for an explanation, but does so anyway.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Our Holy Maiden has just departed for Dukezong. She will be back in two weeks&#x2019; time, and Lord Vairya has decreed a temporary hiatus on worship,&#x201D; he says curtly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; You pretend to be excited. As far as you know, Dukezong is a major Tufan city, and the current seat of their royalty now that Lhasa is taken by their rivals. &#x201C;What is the event?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A competition, and a betrothal of some sort. Look, if you have nothing to do, please move on,&#x201D; sighs the guard. You thank him and back away: it seems that the guard is already getting slightly suspicious. It looks like Yunzi isn&#x2019;t here at the moment&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You settle down and wait for Yunzi here. From the looks of it, Xsaora Vairya may be the one in charge here while she is gone. While she is not around, perhaps you can poke around the Fire Temple and try to understand more of their people, as well as attempt to uncover any secrets they may be hiding here.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You head to Dukezong, three days south of here. If the Tufan are planning an engagement and competition of some sort, it is the perfect opportunity and excuse for you to sneak in and get involved. It&#x2019;s not exactly like you are going there for Yunzi&#x2019;s sake, but you are rather intrigued by what the Tufan have in mind.

            <h3>三 · Betrothal Competition</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Betrothal Competition</span></b><br>
<br>
As you approach Dukezong, the first thing that strikes you are its tall walls. The Tufan have built it up as a fortress city, adding fortifications upon fortifications. The second thing that interests you are the thousands of colourful flags fluttering in the brisk mountain wind, set along the battlements. The city appears to be decorated for festivities, with garlands hanging from almost every brick. The gates are guarded, but open for entry: the guards give you only a brief glance as you enter with Cao&#x2019;er and Qilin &#x2013; the three of you had wrapped up your heads and bodies with travellers&#x2019; cloaks to fend off the cold, leaving only the eyes and noses exposed.<br>
<br>
Stalls and carts line the streets, manned by hawkers touting their wares. Long, ornate banners are stretched between buildings, bearing writing that proclaimed the purpose of the festival, first in Tibetan and then in Han.<br>
<br>
It seems that Prince Songtsen Tenzin, the ruler of Tufan, is seeking a groom for his younger sister, Princess Pema Rinchen. The method by which he is selecting the lucky man is through a martial arts competition, scheduled to begin just tomorrow. A wide variety of martial artists, not only from the steppes and the mountains, but also from the Central Plains itself, have answered his call. After all, riches and glory <i>and </i>a princess&#x2019;s hand await the eventual winner.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;are we going to change Number Three?&#x201D; asks Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I really doubt you are going to come all the way here and not compete,&#x201D; says Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t go for every princess that happens to fall across my path. And stop with that numbering thing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why? How else would we rank our seniority among sisters?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Because&#x2026; ah, because you are all equal in my heart?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin laughs. &#x201C;Right, if you say so. Are you really not going to compete? Wouldn&#x2019;t it be nice, being a Tibetan prince?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I doubt Prince Tenzin will like it if his sister is the third wife,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Make her the main wife, then,&#x201D; replies Qilin cheerfully.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;I&#x2019;m not that irresponsible&#x2026; you&#x2019;ve already claimed that spot&#x2026;&#x201D; you mutter quietly, appearing to do an imitation of Cao&#x2019;er in your reluctance to speak up. Qilin perks up, her eyes shining brightly. &#x201C;Oh? What did you say? Can you say it again?&#x201D; Giving her a dismissive snort, you refuse to play her games and stalk off without answering her.<br>
<br>
Still, whether you compete in this tournament or not is worth some consideration. It looks like a fair number of Eight Sects&#x2019; disciples are also present, perhaps seeking glory and power of their own, though none of them are names that you recognize. They would probably recognize <i>you</i> rather quickly, however. Furthermore, you have gathered that this Prince Songtsen Tenzin appears to have promoted literacy in the Han language in his territory. On the surface, it seems to be a friendly move that would stimulate cultural exchange, trade, and various other opportunities, but you have also heard that this prince is a fan of Sun Wu&#x2019;s Art of War.<br>
<br>
Know your enemy.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You register in the competition. You&#x2019;ll decide what to do when you win, though you really aren&#x2019;t keen on marrying any princesses. Being a competitor might get you access to various sources of information that you would not find otherwise&#x2026; but truthfully, you just really want to test your skills against someone who is not Master Zhang.<br>
If A wins:<br>
<b>1. </b>You register as Man Tiger Pig.<br>
<b>2. </b>You use another pseudonym.<br>
<b>3. </b>You register under your own name.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do not register in the competition. This is not what you are really here for, and the less trouble you get into, the better. Probably. If you are not competing, you can spend more time looking around the city and seeing if there is anything else you can find out for Shun.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
After wandering about the streets and attempting to gather what information you could from the people &#x2013; half of the locals spoke no Han, and the other half spoke it in a mangled manner - it appears that there will be a pre-tournament celebration held in the palacegrounds tonight. There, the princess will preside over a few exhibition matches. You hear that the prince will be demonstrating his skill in such a bout. Yunzi will also be there, as his personal guest of honour.<br>
<br>
You did come all the way here thanks to her invitation, didn&#x2019;t you?<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Find a way to get into the exhibition match; Cao&#x2019;er and Qilin should be able to whip up something that leaves a participant incapacitated, allowing you to sneakily take his place. It&#x2019;ll be a good surprise for Yunzi. Should you have registered for the competition, however, it might be wiser to appear here under another identity&#x2026;<br>
If A wins:<br>
<b>1. </b>Appear with a pig&#x2019;s mask.<br>
<b>2. </b>Try to find another mask to use&#x2026; any mask will do.<br>
<b>3. </b>Appear unmasked.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Entry to the celebration appears to be limited to the upper-class of the city as well as the registered participants. If you have registered, you should be able to enter normally, bringing along Cao&#x2019;er and Qilin as your companions, but should you have decided not to register, you will have to find a way to obtain an invitation.<br>
If you do not have an invitation yet desire to go, you would opt to&#x2026;<br>
<b>1. </b>Swindle one from a gullible contestant by talking them into giving it into you.<br>
<b>2. </b>Lure a weak contestant into a dark alley and take it by force.<br>
<b>3. </b>Pickpocket a contestant that lacks sufficient alertness.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You don&#x2019;t need to attend the festivities to appear before Yunzi. You&#x2019;ll just sneak into her room after it has concluded and talk to her there.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You&#x2019;ll have plenty of chances to talk to her later on: it seems that she is one of the judges for the tournament and will be staying here until the entire event is over, which would likely take quite a few days to conclude. You do not make your approach tonight.

            <h3>四 · Tournament Delay</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tournament Delay</span></b><br>
<br>
The best time for you to enter the palace is while everyone is occupied with the pre-tournament feast. It no longer surprised you to discover that Qilin spoke enough Tibetan to bribe the location of Yunzi&#x2019;s chambers from a palace maid &#x2013; that girl seems to know just a little bit of everything. The corridors of the palace are watched, but with the amount of guards they have on hand, they might as well be deserted to you. Quietly and unseen, you take advantage of the shadows to slink from pillar to pillar, leaving no trace of your passing behind. It does not take you long to reach the room.<br>
<br>
When you enter it, a faint fragrance catches your attention. It is familiar to you, though the memory of it is so vague that you cannot recall when you last caught its scent. You look around the room. The center of the room was dominated by a large, ornate bed.  There were a few polished mirrors and dressing tables placed by the walls, and a row of folding screens. Glancing down at the floor, you  raise your eyebrows in surprise: it seems that the noble and pure Holy Maiden does not have the habit of tidying up after herself. Her undergarments are scattered carelessly on the floor &#x2013; the maids must not have gotten around to cleaning up the room yet.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps I should do her a favour and clean up,&#x201D; you mutter jokingly to yourself as you prod the thin fabric with your toe. You hear loud cheers coming from the courtyard; the celebration may be ending soon. There are no rafters for you to hide in the room, and you opt to go behind the folding screen, where more of Yunzi&#x2019;s garments are hung. Then, you empty your mind, amidst the calming, pleasant fragrance, and wait, as silent and as unmoving as a block of wood.<br>
<br>
After a while, you hear footsteps approaching. There are three sets.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;-can&#x2019;t believe he did that!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Please calm down, Holy Maiden.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I&#x2019;ll be calm. Here are my calm orders. I want no one to disturb me tonight. Not even the prince. Make sure he <i>never </i>gets within sight of my door&#x2026; yes, I <i>know </i>it&#x2019;s his palace. I don&#x2019;t care.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As the complaint continues, you hear the door open and slam shut a moment later. The footsteps shuffle towards the bed, and you hear a muffled scream of rage, as if someone is shouting into the sheets. &#x201C;This is so irritating. I&#x2019;m so tired. I just want to escape everything.  Asena, should I run?&#x201D; You hear Yunzi&#x2019;s weary, pleading whisper from your hiding spot behind the screen, and she begins muttering a prayer in the Tujue language. A sudden thought comes into your mind, and you grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Priestess of the Ashina,&#x201D; you croak, lowering your voice and attempting to throw it around the room as you massage your throat with your fingers: Qilin had taught you a bit of it and you could not even come close to her proficiency, but it was still something you could manage in a pinch, in the right conditions. &#x201C;What ails you so?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201D; Yunzi&#x2019;s reply is sharp and quick: you can feel it being directed towards the folding screen you are behind. It looks like your skills are still insufficient&#x2026; but if she has not recognized you yet, you are going to play this out until you are satisfied. &#x201C;I am an emissary of the mother wolf, holy priestess,&#x201D; you continue, your tone somber and stoic. &#x201C;Child, I am here to share your burdens. Come, allow me to help you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why is an emissary of Asena speaking in Han?&#x201D; asks the girl suspiciously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is the language you desire to hear at this moment, though you may not know it,&#x201D; you reply smoothly. &#x201C;The wolf is mother to all, and these are her ways. Trust in her. Do not question.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you are really a wolf spirit, tell me.&#x201D; Yunzi takes a slightly challenging tone. &#x201C;Tell me what is in my future. Can you do that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course, sacred one. Ommmmmmmmmmmmmmmm~&#x201D; You begin humming deeply, modulating your tone up and down in a way you think rather mysterious and suitable. Then, you say, &#x201C;You will meet a tall, good-looking and extremely charming boy with an eye-patch-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
The folding screen crumples inwards as a palm bursts through the thin paper, interrupting your prophecy. You dodge backwards, the edge of her hand just brushing past the tip of your nose. Then, the folding screen begins smouldering, and bursts into flames shortly after. Clicking your tongue in slight surprise, you dash away from the burning screen.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I knew it was you, you impudent dog,&#x201D; says Yunzi triumphantly as she leaps to the attack. &#x201C;Brilliant deduction, Holy Maiden. Hey, aren&#x2019;t you worried about that fire you just started?&#x201D; you respond. Blocking her blows, you attempt to retaliate but she slips quickly out of your sight, always remaining just vaguely in your peripheral vision. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, even if I burn down the room, it is fine if you are burnt to ashes along with it. You&#x2019;ll pay for all your sins tonight,&#x201D; Stopping in her tracks suddenly, she sends both her palms towards you with a powerful thrust. You whip your arm up and meet it with a claw strike, countering her force directly with your own. A small gust of wind swirls around the room as your hand meets hers, blowing out the flames from the folding screen. Resisting the burning <i>qi </i>with no small amount of pain, you begin pushing Yunzi back with your superior strength, but she suddenly kicks out at you. You leap, evading her kick. She takes the opportunity to twist at your arm while you are in the air, attempting to wrench you painfully to the ground by using your own momentum against you. You spin, pulling at her. You&#x2019;re not going down without a fight.<br>
<br>
As the both of you struggle to gain the upper hand over the other, whirling about the room in a strange, violent dance, you trip over the smouldering remains of the screen and crash onto the bed, taking her down with you. She stares at you, breathing heavily. Her skin is flushed, a bead of sweat dripping down her brow. Her sweat, mixed with the fragrance &#x2013; now you recall where you had encountered it: it was during your first fight with her, back on the steppes. The two of you are so close that your noses are almost touching. Her mouth parts slightly.<br>
<br>
There is a knock at the door.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Holy Maiden, are you all right?&#x201D; It is a female&#x2019;s voice.<br>
<br>
After a brief, awkward moment, she pulls her eyes away from yours, sitting up straight. &#x201C;Y-yes! I am fine. I was practicing our Temple&#x2019;s skills. I do not want to be disturbed for the rest of the night, so leave me to my training,&#x201D; she calls out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see. I thought I sensed some other person in there. Unfortunately, the prince just sent a message that he would like to meet you in the garden for a moonlit walk, Holy Maiden. He is waiting for you in the grounds.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am tired and uninterested,&#x201D; replies Yunzi with a firm tone. &#x201C;Turn him down.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I understand and obey, Holy Maiden,&#x201D; says the voice dutifully.<br>
<br>
After you are certain that her attendant has gone, you ask, &#x201C;Is that woman one of your Amesha Spenta?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, she is. A new one, ascended to the position just a few months ago. Not all of them made it back from Heihu Valley alive,&#x201D; comes the reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sounds interesting,&#x201D; you say, earning yourself a venomous stare from the Holy Maiden.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, why are you here?&#x201D; The question seems accusing, as if she thinks you are here to do mischief.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you invite me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;To the temple, yes. <i>Two</i> years ago.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Better late than never.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Spoken like a boy who has never known responsibility.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t aware that I was responsible to<i> you</i> in any way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi falls silent, apparently yearning to say something. She shakes her head slightly, however, and changes the topic. &#x201C;Did you sign up for the tournament?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I knew it. I knew you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to resist,&#x201D; she exclaims, half-amused and half-frustrated. &#x201C;What is it with you and your habit of fighting for the right to marry princesses?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Habit? I only did it-&#x201C; You pause, remembering that you had challenged Yunzi for her hand in marriage once before, though you had not known what it meant then. Perhaps it would be wiser for you not to argue this point. &#x201C;Princess Rinchen is a nice girl,&#x201D; says Yunzi seriously. &#x201C;If you are not going to treat her with the respect she deserves, drop out.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are assuming that I am going to win. Thank you for your confidence,&#x201D; you say jokingly. Your teasing seems to disarm her slightly. &#x201C;I-I have seen the other competitors just now, at the feast. As an impartial judge, I must say that those that I have seen don&#x2019;t really stand a chance against you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Judge, eh? Why did Prince Tenzin ask you to preside over the tournament anyway? It seems strange, I must say, asking the Fire Temple&#x2019;s Holy Maiden to be his guest of honour.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi is suddenly flustered, colour rising into her cheeks. She closes her eyes and says, &#x201C;He just proposed to me publicly at the feast just now, after he won his exhibition match. It seems that he wants to make me his wife at the same time that his sister marries the champion for double festivities. Inviting me here was merely a setup for the plan.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How&#x2026; romantic. You must be flattered,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Bothersome is what it is,&#x201D; replies Yunzi quickly. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t expect he would make his move so openly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Reject him then.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t know. We will see. I need to consult with Vahista and Vairya first.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Because of the Fire Temple? Is he going to hold them hostage if you don&#x2019;t comply?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, don&apos;t be silly. Prince Tenzin is not that sort of person.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem to be rather familiar with what sort of person he is,&#x201D; you laugh, but Yunzi does not seem to find it funny. Her eyes flash angrily, but she bites back whatever she was going to throw at you. You shake your head. &#x201C;If you are tired, just leave.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Temple saved my life,&#x201D; she says flatly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So did I, and I did it even earlier,&#x201D; you say wryly. &#x201C;If that is all it takes&#x2026;&#x201D; What you say next surprises even yourself. The words are out of your mouth before they even begin to register in your mind. &#x201C;Come with me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi stares at you, a strange expression on her face.<br>
<br>
There is another knock at the door.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Holy Maiden, I am afraid I <i>do</i> sense someone in the room after all. There could be an intruder.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait, Armaiti! Let me get dressed, then you can check the room with me, together,&#x201D; replies Yunzi loudly. Turning to you, she hisses, &#x201C;Go!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod. Yunzi gets off of you, allowing you to roll off the bed. You move towards the window, casting one last glance at the irritated Holy Maiden and grinning, before jumping out.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Esteemed masters, we have an unexpected problem,&#x201D; says the chief administrator of the tournament apologetically. He gives you a nervous look. &#x201C;It seems that most of our participants have dropped out this morning.&#x201D; Indeed, your participation had become public knowledge rather soon, and there was little doubt left once you appeared in the entrance hall. Apparently many of the pugilists have weighed their chances of survival against the rewards of Princess Rinchen&#x2019;s hand in marriage, and found the odds wanting: your reputation has spread to such an extent that it seems even the foreign pugilistic community is aware of some made-up rumours about your bloodthirst, though you think it is likely that Zhang Jue&apos;s own reputation and travels have played a big part in creating that effect.<br>
<br>
The exodus was swift.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We had planned for a preliminary elimination competition, but now that we are down to only nine participants, it seems that we must convene with Prince Tenzin to decide how we proceed next,&#x201D; continues the chief administrator haltingly. &#x201C;The start of the competition will be postponed to the afternoon.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
That is why you find yourself enjoying a meal in the finest inn in Dukezong, compliments of the tournament organization committee. &#x201C;I was surprised when you came back so early,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;&#x2026;yes&#x2026; I thought you would have stayed the night with Number Three&#x2026;&#x201D; agrees Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing like that between me and that girl,&#x201D; you say, looking around the inn. A few of the other participants are also here.<br>
<br>
One of them, a young Tibetan man, is being scolded by a pretty teenage girl as he looks into his bowl of wine sullenly. After a while, she walks out of the inn, exasperated, though as she passes by you her eyes seem to light up with some sort of interest.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I caught what they said,&#x201D; says Qilin quietly. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t imagine it is a secret to the locals at this rate. Does the Tibetan look familiar to you?&#x201D; You shake your head, and she grins. &#x201C;Of course not, but your path has crossed his once before, two years ago. His name is Jixuan Wuni.&#x201D; You vaguely recall such a name making it to the bracketed elimination match, though you had not faced the man in combat.<br>
<br>
She continues. &#x201C;And that girl&#x2026; Cao&#x2019;er and I snuck into the feast last night, while you were busy rolling around with your precious Holy Maiden. That&#x2019;s the younger sister of Princess Pema Rinchen. I didn&#x2019;t manage to catch her name, but I definitely saw her there.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Was it a lover&#x2019;s spat?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Close. She&#x2019;s telling him that it is better for him to run off with Princess Rinchen than to participate in the bloodsport her brother organized.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, I got it,&#x201D; you say, understanding the situation instantly. &#x201C;Knew you&#x2019;d get it, darling,&#x201D; smiles Qilin. &#x201C;If you entered the feast last night, do you see any other faces I would do well to remember?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin glances around, and then frowns. &#x201C;Ah, there&#x2019;s one. Cao&#x2019;er, do you remember him?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s expression darkens scarily. &#x201C;Him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You turn to look at the person that they are displeased about. It appears to be a handsome, rich Han man in his twenties, accompanied by a bevy of the usual sycophants you would expect to see. He is drinking happily with his gang, roaring in laughter.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do not have much details on him, but his name is Zhang Manxing,&#x201D; mutters Qilin. &#x201C;He tried to drug me and Cao&#x2019;er last night. Luckily, we were adept enough to slip away.&#x201D; Just as she says that, Zhang Manxing looks over. His eyes widen with glee. &#x201C;Oh, it is the two fair beauties! What a coincidence!&#x201D; He walks over to your table, a wide grin on his face. &#x201C;Is this your brother?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin arches her eyebrow, telling you to handle it. It looks like even she does not have the patience to deal with this man. You look up at him and smile politely. &#x201C;No, I am not.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; he says, slightly annoyed at the brevity of your answer. &#x201C;Well, you must be one of the participants in the tournament. It looks like you have not dropped out from some silly fear of this Southern Maniac&#x2019;s disciple they say is taking part.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I have nothing to fear.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good show!&#x201D; he shouts, slapping you on the back hard, laughing. &#x201C;It is a pity that a man as brave as you entered the competition when I am here. The Tufan Princess will be mine without a doubt!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you for the compliment, but who might you be?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
An aggrieved shout rises from Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s table. &#x201C;You call yourself Han and yet you do not know our Young Master? He is Zhang Manxing, younger brother of Chief Secretary Zhang Manlou, whose godfather is Grand Eunuch Wang! He is here with the personal blessings of our great Emperor Xuande!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A very impressive background, Young Master Zhang,&#x201D; you say, wondering if he actually did receive Shun&#x2019;s personal permission to participate. &#x201C;You must have had the best training in martial arts.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course I have,&#x201D; he grins proudly. &#x201C;I received instructions from masters of all the Great Eight Sects. The leader of the pugilistic world, and the most powerful martial artist living, Master Nie Wuxing of Huashan, is my personal teacher. When it comes to martial arts, I dare say I am the equal of Bai Jiutian.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, that will be something to look forward to. Please go easy on me,&#x201D; you murmur, looking down as if you are frightened. He does not look that strong to you, though you cannot rule out that he is hiding his true strength for the tournament. Still, his family interests you more than his supposed skill: you recall that Zhang Manlou was the man who set Liu Chanfeng down on a self-destructive path, inciting her hatred of all things male.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, no-name, it is good that you know who I am,&#x201D; sneers Zhang Manxing, pleased that you appear intimidated. He looks at Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er with unbridled lust, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be seeing you around. You and your two beautiful female friends.&#x201D; He wanders back to his table as you sigh. You cast your eyes around the inn again, matching faces to some names and stories that you have heard on your way here&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Three other people catch your attention:<br>
<br>
Pang Xiaohu, the son of the self-proclaimed Bandit King, Pang Hu.<br>
<br>
Xuxian, a young local monk who has just returned from a stay in Shaolin, and is rumoured to be the disciple of a mysterious, powerful  and reclusive Tibetan lama.<br>
<br>
Jiu Mou, a young member of the Beggars&#x2019; Sect.<br>
<br>
You wonder if you should approach any of them before the tournament begins.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You approach Jixuan Wuni. Though you had not spoken to the man before this, you are interested in hearing more about his story with Princess Rinchen, even though you know what it probably is all about. If true love is involved, you can&apos;t not support it.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You approach Zhang Manxing. His appearance here could be a matter of politics. It could do you well to try and ingratiate yourself with him for now; this might be part of Shun&#x2019;s plan, and you don&#x2019;t want to mess it up.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You approach Pang Xiaohu, the Little Tiger of the Bandit Kingdom. If he has come here, it probably means that the Bandit Kingdom is seeking to further expand its influence. Perhaps you could find out more about their motives and actions.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You approach Xuxian, the Tibetan monk from Shaolin. You might be mistaken, but your instinct tells you that he is the most powerful fighter here: you feel that he has a powerful inner strength.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You approach Jiu Mou. A beggar from the Sect willingly participating in such a tournament seems rather rare, though he also holds himself differently from the other beggars you have seen. You wonder just why he is here.<br>
<br>
<b>F. </b>You do not approach anyone. You are here to fight, not to listen to their stories.

            <h3>五 · Fight or Flight for Love</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fight or Flight for Love</span></b><br>
<br>
Without waiting to be invited, you get up from your table and take a seat in front of Jixuan Wuni. His face scrunches up slightly at your approach, but he does not do anything rash like attacking you or jumping out of the window. &#x201C;What business do you have with me, Man Tiger Pig?&#x201D; he says slowly, as if he feels the need to think and enunciate each of his words clearly. &#x201C;I just thought I would have a drink with a fellow contestant,&#x201D; you say, putting your elbows on the table cockily. &#x201C;Any particular Tibetan brews you recommend?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If I tell you, will you leave me in peace?&#x201D; he asks, scowling.<br>
<br>
You make a show of thinking for a while before nodding your head. &#x201C;No.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His scowl deepens and his gaze drops back to his food and drink. Jixuan Wuni sighs heavily, scratching his head. &#x201C;Look, Man Tiger Pig. I want no trouble with you. We will fight later and I will do my best. There is no need for you to seek me out. Leave the violence for the tournament.&#x201D; It seems like he thinks you are here to goad him into a fight. You laugh heartily. &#x201C;That is not what I am here for.&#x201D; Leaning forward, you whisper, &#x201C;You seem to be pretty chummy with some princesses.&#x201D; The blood drains from his expression as he stares at you in horror. &#x201C;You will not lay a finger on them,&#x201D; Jixuan Wuni growls, his knuckles turning white as his fists tighten. &#x201C;Wait, just <i>what </i>sort of monster do you think I am?&#x201D; you ask quietly, mildly surprised at his reaction. He tells you. It appears that during the two years that you have been on the island, there have been several opportunistic knaves using your name to commit evil deeds near the less-policed frontiers of the Tang lands. Of course, it was nothing that people wouldn&#x2019;t already put past you: murders, robberies, teasing virgin maidens, but it seems that your reputation as a no-good vagrant is on its way to being set in stone.<br>
<br>
You pinch the bridge of your nose with a wry smile. &#x201C;The rumours of my misdeeds have been greatly exaggerated, I assure you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can say whatever you want.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will. Trust me when I say I have no designs on Princess Rinchen.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you do not wish to marry her, why do you compete?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I was just bored,&#x201D; you say, and he seems to accept that answer all too readily. You are not sure whether to regard that as a good thing or a bad thing. Looking around, you grin and say, &#x201C;It would be easier to do what the little princess suggests, wouldn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Jixuan Wuni shakes his head solemnly. &#x201C;You do not understand.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Help me understand.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He shakes his head again. &#x201C;I will not gossip. I do not know you well enough, Man Tiger Pig, and you do not know me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What if I told you I want to help you get the girl?&#x201D; You speak quietly, dangling your offer in front of him with a charming little smile as you put forward your most trustworthy face.<br>
<br>
His lips narrow, forming a thin, hard line. &#x201C;Do you not think you are being a little insulting? Why would you think I need your help?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps it may injure your pride, true... but it is practical.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My feelings for the princess are something I can only prove with my fists.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is why you are refusing to run away, eh? A man&#x2019;s man, Jixuan Wuni. You have my respect,&#x201D; you say, bowing deeply with just a hint of sarcasm in your voice. When you raise your head, you look him straight in the eye. &#x201C;Believe me when I say that I am offering my aid with no strings attached.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What reason would you have to help me? What would you gain from it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;Why, this is what I do! Stealing royalty and mocking the pompous! The fun is payment enough. Now, since the little princess was speaking so loudly just now, I have no doubt everyone knows about you and Princess Rinchen. If you won&#x2019;t tell me, I can ask  about it from someone else&#x2026; and they might embellish it plenty. <i>You </i>will be truthful, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see you love to poke your nose where it is unneeded,&#x201D; he says glumly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I poke plenty of things. So, what will it be?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a  resigned look on his face, Jixuan Wuni begins to speak. &#x201C;The princess was out on an inspection of the country. Back then everyone was poor and the security was bad. Her carriage was attacked by bandits. The guards were of no use. I helped her run, and we have been meeting occasionally ever since.&#x201D; You wait for him to continue, but he looks away awkwardly. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You shrug. Sometimes simple stories are the most meaningful, as Master Zhang once said. Of course, his idea of simple usually just involved a powerful opponent, himself, and a <i>glorious</i> battle. &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t say I have any romantic tales of my own that would top that, so I can&#x2019;t complain. Why don&#x2019;t you run away with her again, like her sister suggested?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do not want to sneak away with her in the night like some shameless rogue. If I am a man, I should stand and fight for her hand, and prove I am more worthy than all the others.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that what she wants?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He looks down. &#x201C;Well&#x2026; no. She thinks it would be easier if we ran. But that is not right. We cannot run forever. Tufan is her home, the Prince is her brother. I cannot ask her to give up her status just to be with me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Before you can say anything else, an emissary from the palace arrives with news of the tournament. He relays the message in both Tibetan and Han: it appears that the competition will proceed as scheduled in the afternoon. Prince Tenzin has deliberated long and hard, and finally come to an answer &#x2013; all the remaining nine participants would compete at once in a battle royale, after the fashion of the legendary and prestigious Huashan Summit. Apparently, he thinks that it would only be fitting to do so, with an actual disciple of one of the Five Great Pugilists here to grace his competition. The message even takes the pleasure of naming you as his inspiration for this decision, and he hopes that this will be an exciting, fair fight worthy of his sister&#x2019;s hand.<br>
<br>
You think it is more likely that you get piled on by everyone else seconds after the bell is rung.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Son of a mountain goat,&#x201D; you curse.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>There is yet a few hours before the competition is due to start. Now that the palace is busy with the final preparations for the tournament, this should be the perfect time to steal away Princess Rinchen. You persuade Jixuan Wuni that he should elope instead of participating in the tournament like some hard-headed fool. As it is more likely for a loser to attempt abduction after an acrimonious loss in the tournament, they will never see you coming in the middle of the day, before the competition has even begun. Of course, the prince may be expecting this move - Jixuan&apos;s relationship with the princess seems to be an open secret, but it should not be anything you can&apos;t handle. He is the sort of man that would live more comfortably outside of the palace anyway: that much you can tell.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You proceed with the tournament: it may be a good test of your ability to see if you can guide Jixuan Wuni through the free-for-all and have him achieve victory. You will spend the next few hours gauging his level of ability, and having done that, impart to him the basics of one of your combat techniques you think would help him come out ahead. If it is his wish to be recognized as the rightful partner of the princess, you would like to help him accomplish that. Of course, it is rather probable that every other contestant will be gunning for your scalp once the fight starts, and combined with the possible need to assist Jixuan Wuni that may prove to be an obstacle that even you may not overcome.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You enter the tournament to win it. You think it would be a waste of your time to try and help the Tibetan in the tournament. You still have no interest in marrying the princess, but now that you have heard of Jixuan Wuni&apos;s story, perhaps you can fob her off to him afterwards. The marriage ceremony should not take place immediately after the tournament concludes: there will probably be time for you to run off or even steal the princess for him should you come out victorious.

            <h3>六 · An Unexpected Challenger</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">An Unexpected Challenger</span></b><br>
<br>
Jixuan Wuni is a masterful fighter with the chakram, a weapon you have seen only rarely in your travels. He wears the sharpened metal rings around his arms and legs, six on each limb, and is adept at both throwing them from a distance and wielding them as a melee weapon. When worn, they also act as a guard that few fighters would dare strike with their bare hands, helping to augment his unarmed prowess. As you spar with him, you begin to understand the current limits of his ability. Though in terms of speed and strength he is inferior to you, he appears to be able to keep up with your movements with his eyes, even if the rest of his body is unable to follow. Though you did not push him to his limit, his stamina should outstrip yours too: he seems to be a sturdy fellow. Unfortunately, his inner strength is lacking. Jixuan Wuni has not received proper instruction in department, his teacher focusing on the superficial aspect of physical combat and neglecting the cultivation of internal energy. You are not sure whether it is a trait of the school of martial arts he hails from, or whether he is just naturally deficient in the area &#x2013; you are not experienced enough to tell. You would not have enough time to instruct him on <i>neigong</i>, and you would not be the best person to do so anyway, considering your own strange <i>qi</i>. You may be able to give him some <i>qinggong</i> pointers, however.<br>
<br>
Jixuan Wuni&#x2019;s skill at hand-to-hand combat appears to be equal with that of his weapon ability, though you are quite sure you are still ahead in both aspects. It might also be possible for you to try and adapt some of your sword techniques for use with the chakram. His attacks are quick and forceful, reminiscent of the hard Shaolin styles rather than the soft Taiji method; this should make him rather compatible with the techniques you have. With that in mind, you decide to teach him:<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Wuying Leipo Kick.<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> Xianglong Eighteen Palms.<br>
<br>
<b>C.</b> Shouwang Mad Claws.<br>
<br>
<b>D.</b> Chuzhan Fist.<br>
<br>
<b>E.</b> Minamoto-ryuu Sword Style.<br>
<br>
<b>F.</b> Self-Taught Sword Style.<br>
<br>
<b>G. </b>Kuanglang Step.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You step onto the stage, the last to arrive. It is a circular wooden platform that is large enough to occupy a good part of the main square. The people of the city are watching from stands set up specifically for the tournament, windows, and even the rooftops of the buildings around the square. Loud music blares from their pipe instruments as the audience cheers excitedly for the fight to begin. You glance casually around the stage, looking at the opposing fighters.<br>
<br>
Jixuan Wuni is already here, his expression deadly serious. He gives you a brief nod when you catch his eye.<br>
<br>
Besides him is a young Tibetan warrior, one of the sons of the Prince&#x2019;s trusted general, it seems: Langtsu Maide, and then his brother, Songtsu Taide. Both are bedecked in light armour, spear in one hand and shield in the other. They look straight ahead, calmly awaiting the start of battle.<br>
<br>
Then there is the young beggar, Jiu Mou, lying on his side in his dirty clothes as he shakes one propped-up leg in a rude manner. He glances at you and shrugs, tapping his beggar&#x2019;s stick to a catchy beat.<br>
<br>
The Shaolin-trained Tibetan monk, Xuxian, is the next one you see. He sits cross-legged, his palms clapped together and his eyes closed in serene meditation. You sense a vague, quiet power about him.<br>
<br>
The Bandit Prince, Pang Xiaohu, is standing with arms folded, his shaggy hair resting on his shoulders. He looks rather impatient as he stares at you: you can sense his bloodlust. Here is a man that loves to fight.<br>
<br>
Finally, there is Zhang Manxing and one of his servants, a cowering girl who seems to be called Xiaofang.  You wonder why she is still fighting when her eyes betray the massive amount of panic that must be swirling in her mind. Zhang already has a sword in hand, looking imperiously at the rest of the fighters. He frowns when he sees you &#x2013; it looks like he had not recognized you as the infamous Man Tiger Pig before this, but he seems no less confident.<br>
<br>
The guests of honour are sitting at a special stand which, of course, has the best view of the stage. Yunzi is there swaddled in jewelry and finery, the female Amesha Spenta Armaiti standing behind her. There is a handsome Tibetan man in his late twenties dressed in rich and colourful robes: this must be Prince Songtsen Tenzin. His sisters sit next to him &#x2013; there is the one you saw before at the inn, Princess Sonam Jinpa, and the goal of the tournament herself, Princess Pema Rinchen.<br>
<br>
Prince Tenzin stands up and raises his hand. The noisy pipes fall silent, as does the crowd. &#x201C;Good citizens of Dukezong!&#x201D; he proclaims, his voice strong and rich enough to carry throughout the square. As he begins to introduce the purpose of the tournament yet again, you catch sight of Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er in the aged section of the crowd, waving a banner that somehow reads &#x201C;GOOD LUCK MY DUCK&#x201D; which seems to be rather well-accepted by the cheerful old Tibetans sitting around them. They must have misspelled it, you think.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Before we begin the tournament, I would once again like to restate my proposal to the lovely and talented Holy Maiden of the Fire Temple, Lady Yunzi, in front of all the people that I love,&#x201D; says the prince cheerfully. As he turns to Yunzi and bows, beaming, you see her expression freeze. You grin. It looks like he&#x2019;s been <i>just</i> a bit too pushy, and this is the last straw. Yunzi does not say a word in response. She stands up silently, ignoring the protests of Armaiti.<br>
<br>
Then, she leaps onto the stage.<br>
<br>
The square becomes very, very quiet.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Noble prince!&#x201D; she shouts, pulling the jewelry off of her in a very unmaidenly manner. &#x201C;Where I come from, a proposal must be backed by courage and strength! I will not yield to anyone who is my inferior, so if you think you are good enough, show it!&#x201D; You do not think it is a very diplomatic way of speaking to a powerful prince of Tufan, but then again, she has never been a very diplomatic princess.<br>
<br>
Prince Tenzin&#x2019;s smile only grows wider, the fires of his interest stoked by Yunzi&#x2019;s challenge. His guards and ministers surround him, pleading with him not to be rash, but he waves them away. &#x201C;Interesting! Lady Yunzi, do you mean your words?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I believe in what I say,&#x201D; replies Yunzi with conviction. &#x201C;On the other hand, should <i>I </i>win this competition, I would have your sister join me in the Temple.&#x201D; As hostage for Prince Tenzin&#x2019;s good behaviour, you presume, but that remains unspoken.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Done!&#x201D; grins the prince fiercely. He follows onto the stage with a confident stride, leaving behind a lot of concerned and worried court members.<br>
<br>
As Yunzi walks by you haughtily, putting some distance between her and Prince Tenzin, you whisper, &#x201C;Admit it, you just wanted an excuse to fight me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you getting a bit too full of yourself? Anyway, last night was inconclusive. Let&#x2019;s make this round three,&#x201D; she replies quietly.<br>
<br>
A few of the other contestants appear to be rather confused at the sudden inclusion of Yunzi and Prince Tenzin: <i>are </i>they allowed to hurt them? They do not have time to ponder any possible, unspoken changes in the rules, however, as the prince shouts for the tournament to begin.<br>
<br>
He immediately goes after Yunzi, who casts you a look of annoyance and darts off to face him.<br>
<br>
It takes a few seconds for the other participants to decide what they want to do&#x2026; and as you expected, all of them turn to look at you. You would not be surprised if at least some of them have come to an agreement beforehand.<br>
<br>
You tap your foot impatiently, scratching your head as you count the stares. &#x201C;One, two, three... look, I know I&#x2019;m the best looking guy around here, but don&#x2019;t stare at me together like that. I&#x2019;m shy.&#x201D; Somehow, what you say triggers them to launch their attack. Xuxian and Jiu Mou stay behind, standing where they are, but the others shamelessly make a charge at you. Before they can get to you, Jixuan Wuni blindsides Langtsu Maide, knocking down the Tibetan officer while he is too preoccupied with your presence.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s time for you to act. It would probably be wiser for you to leave the monk and the beggar aside instead of drawing them into the fight, but as for the others&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You focus your attack on Pang Xiaohu, the Little Tiger who is swinging around an axe in each hand and laughing maniacally. He seems to be a powerful fighter.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You focus your attack on Zhang Manxing: that man rubs you the wrong way, and you want him to be the first one to go.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You focus your attack on Songtsu Taide, attempting to defeat the Tibetan before he goes back to his brother&#x2019;s aid.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You try to slip past your assailants and attack Langtsu Maide, going to Jixuan Wuni&#x2019;s aid. It&#x2019;ll be easier for him to defeat the man if it is two on one.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You go after Prince Tenzin, attempting to drag him and Yunzi into the battle. He can&#x2019;t expect to have an uninterrupted duel with her if he steps into a stage that he declared to be a free-for-all, can he?<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You hold back, using just the minimum amount of force whenever possible.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You will not hold anything back. If anyone dies... well, they knew the risks coming into the competition.

            <h3>七 · First Blood</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">First Blood</span></b><br>
<br>
You do not wait for them to come to you.<br>
<br>
You jump, flying into the air, the arc of your leap ending over their heads.<br>
<br>
A Tibetan spear thrusts forward to meet you. Twisting in mid-air, you kick the spear aside and land unimpeded.<br>
<br>
An axe swings powerfully at your head. Tucking your body inwards, you hit the ground rolling.<br>
<br>
You get to your feet, knocking aside the hand that is attempting to run a sword through you, and strike.<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing manages to dodge at the last moment, your fingers tearing away the front of his clothes. There is both surprise and anger etched on his face, though he manages to muster up a confident laugh and regain his composure swiftly. &#x201C;You came for me first? Did you think I was the weakest of us all, and that you could dispose of me quickly?&#x201D; he taunts.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, out of all the people here, your looks would be improved the most by a good beating,&#x201D; you respond, darting forward to resume the fight. A curse on his lips, Zhang Manxing sheathes his sword and takes on a defensive Taiji stance &#x2013; perhaps it is true that he has learnt from each of the sects. He deflects each of your strikes with great effort, his moves more rough than gentle, but it seems that he does understand the basics of the form.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose you aren&#x2019;t going to fight me yet, then,&#x201D; you hear the Little Tiger say lightly, and he whirls around without warning, his axes aiming for the neck of Songtsu Taide, who had been about to turn and help his brother. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll just have <i>you</i> as an appetizer!&#x201D; roars the young bandit gleefully. The Tibetan raises his shield to block but Pang Xiaohu cleaves it in half without even stopping. Laughing, he goes on the attack against Songtsu, who is forced to discard the now useless shield and retreat in the face of the maniacal axeman&#x2019;s onslaught.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Looking away in a fight? You underestimate me too much!&#x201D; A shout draws your attention back  towards Zhang Manxing, who has unsheathed his sword again and is attempting to cut you down. You block his blade with the scabbard of your wodao, but before you can draw and slash he has retreated, the point of his sword facing you cautiously. You recognize the stance of Emei&#x2019;s Qingcheng Stab. With a quick dart forward he advances again, his footwork changing as his swordplay shifts into a wild and fast form you have faced before &#x2013; Huashan&#x2019;s swift sword technique. This time, you are ready for it.<br>
<br>
Zhang&#x2019;s sword comes rushing down onto your head. You raise your scabbard and catch the edge of his blade, just mere inches away from your brow. Before he can pull away, you swing down, pulling his sword downwards. You draw your wodao as your swing passes its lowest point, and in one fluid, circular motion you slash upwards, completing the circle. It is only his good fortune that prevents you from removing half of his head: as he stumbles in surprise, the point of your sword only manages to draw a red, bloody line across his cheek.<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing screams in pain, clutching his face as he backs away from you. &#x201C;You&#x2026; you dare cut my face! You&#x2019;ll pay for this!&#x201D; Quietly, you sheath your sword and spread your arms. &#x201C;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201D; you say mockingly, &#x201C;I <i>did </i>say I would <i>beat</i> your face in until it looked better. Here, let me fix that.&#x201D; You leap to the attack as he drops his sword in a hurry and falls into a Taiji stance again. This time, you do not form a claw with your hand, but a fist. You drive it straight at his face. His arm comes up to deflect and redirect the momentum, but the sheer power and speed of your Chuzhan Fist brushes the arm away before it manages to do much. It is, however, enough that your punch merely clips his ear, turning it into a bloody mess, instead of outright mangling his face as you had wanted.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s not like you are feeling particularly protective of Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er; you just do not take kindly to people who would try to assault them.<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing stumbles away from you, gasping for breath as he moans from the pain. His confidence seems to have vanished, leaving behind a pathetic, whimpering husk of a man. You stride towards him, whistling a catchy ditty Yorimitsu was inspired to compose after meeting Zhang Jue. If he is really the equal of Bai Jiutian, then standards at Huashan have really dropped.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xiaofang! Xiaofang, where are you? Useless dog!&#x201D; he shrieks suddenly. &#x201C;Why did you even follow me here if you weren&#x2019;t going to help me out when I needed it? Quickly! Defeat this maniac or all is lost!&#x201D; You feel a presence manifesting behind you suddenly. Whirling around, you find yourself face to face with the servant girl, Xiaofang. She is fast&#x2026; but you are faster. You snatch her wrist, twisting it to make her drop the dagger, and bring her down to the floor with a quick flick. As her <i>qi</i> begins to drain, you sense something off about it though you cannot comprehend just what is strange at the moment. You let go of her arm and prepare to kick the servant off the stage.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait!&#x201D; whispers Xiaofang desperately, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m the Emperor&#x2019;s loyal servant!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t we all, when we find ourselves about to be beaten?&#x201D; you smile.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I do mean it. I serve the Emperor directly. I have heard of your name from my superior. We are on the same side!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You groan. &#x201C;I hope it&#x2019;s not who I think it is.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We must have Zhang Manxing win the competition,&#x201D; pleads Xiaofang. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s for the sake of the dynasty!&#x201D; You suppose that his victory <i>would </i>benefit Shun, but still&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Funny how you say that at this time,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;Couldn&#x2019;t you have told me before?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I did not know&#x2026; I was not sure-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
Xiaofang is interrupted by a loud scream and a gurgle that causes the cheering crowd to fall silent. You snap your head up and see a terrible sight: Songtsu Taide is flat on the floor, cut clean in half at the waist. His blood has stained the floor a dark red, seeping into the wood. Pang Xiaohu has his arms crossed again, red staining his face and clothes. &#x201C;So, are you going to fight me now, Xu Jing?&#x201D; Before you can respond, Langtsu Maide shouts out in rage and agony, attempting to run towards his brother&#x2019;s killer. Jixuan Wuni strikes quickly, knocking Langtsu down from behind while he is distracted. The Tibetan warrior falls down unconscious, out of the fight. That was probably a kind decision &#x2013; had he not done so, you could see Langtsu sharing his brother&#x2019;s fate in the next few seconds.<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing is clutching the side of his face, staring wildly around the arena as he tries to figure out what to do next.<br>
<br>
The monk, Xuxian, is walking towards Pang Xiaohu with a terrified expression on his face, though you can see that his eyes are full of resolve. It looks like he is joining the fight. The beggar Jiu Mou, on the other hand, has stood up and begins walking the other way, to the edge of the stage. The audience murmurs in surprise as he hops off the stage, disqualifying himself. Casting one last look over the proceedings, he sighs loudly before resting his stick against his shoulder and wandering off.<br>
<br>
Prince Tenzin is slumped against one of the stands outside the stage, battered, dazed, and tended to by half a dozen guards. Yunzi catches you looking at her and she shrugs, smiling. &#x201C;No challenge,&#x201D; she mouths silently. You shake your head at her arrogance. You&#x2019;ll see how well she fares against you later.<br>
<br>
You can feel the tension rising between Xuxian and Pang Xiaohu, who is looking down on the short, slight monk with raised eyebrows. &#x201C;It looks like you&#x2019;re not too bad yourself, baldie,&#x201D; he grunts. &#x201C;I guess I&#x2019;ll take you on before I move onto the main dish.&#x201D; Hefting his axes again, he attacks.<br>
<br>
To his surprise, the monk blocks his axes with his bare palms &#x2013; you think it is Jinzhongzhao, which Guo Fu had demonstrated before, but somehow in this monk&#x2019;s hands it seems slightly different. It does not seem to elicit anything but glee from the Little Tiger, however, and his attacks grow ever fiercer.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey,&#x201D; says a voice timidly under your heel. You look down: you had almost forgotten that you still had Xiaofang under your shoe. She stares up at you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s time to decide what to do with these self-claimed emissaries of Shun&#x2019;s will. They might be telling the truth, or they might not: you have no time to find out. Still, you feel it is likely that Xiaofang is not lying.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You put them out of the tournament. Regardless of what Shun has planned, he is not here right now. You will do as you see fit.<br>
<b>1. </b>You slaughter Zhang Manxing on the stage. What is one more person dead?<br>
<b>2. </b>You spare him &#x2013; you have clearly shown that you are the better fighter: there is no need to do anything beyond giving him a sound beating.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You leave them be: perhaps they do have a plan from Shun, and you do not want to interfere with it more than you already have.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
It looks like the state of the battle has changed yet again: in the blink of an eye three competitors out of the original nine have been eliminated, and the Prince appears to have tremendously overestimated his abilities compared to Yunzi. Xuxian and Pang Xiaohu are battling it out in the middle of the stage, with the monk seeming to hold the upper hand. Jixuan Wuni is standing back, waiting to see what you will do. Yunzi is looking at you with a glint in her eyes: you realize that if you don&#x2019;t do anything at all, she&#x2019;ll be likely to jump you, looking for a good fight.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You join the fight between the monk and the bandit. Yunzi might interfere, but even in that case you should be able to handle the fight.<br>
<b>1. </b>You side with the monk: Pang Xiaohu is a bloodthirsty killer and should be eliminated as soon as possible.<br>
<b>2. </b>You side with the bandit: Xuxian is the stronger fighter, and it makes more sense to defeat him first.<br>
<b>3. </b>You attack them both, turning it into a three-way fight. That&apos;s the <i>fun </i>way to do it.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You head to the side with Yunzi for the private fight that she wants. You can deal with whoever is left over later, after you&#x2019;ve finally made it clear to the stubborn Holy Maiden that you are the better fighter.

					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tibetan Trouble</span></b><br>
<br>
Offering her no words of comfort, you boot a surprised Xiaofang off the stage and head for Zhang Manxing. As you approach, he gives you a hateful glare, raising his fists. You trade only two blows before you successfully grab him by the neck. Evidently he is not used to fighting while injured, as you can see him constantly wincing from the injury to his ear. As he shouts bloody curses at you, you throw him out of the arena so that he can join the servant girl.<br>
<br>
Then, you turn your attention towards the monk and the bandit, who are still locked in battle. Yunzi calls out to you to get your attention, but all you do is give her a grin before you join the fight.<br>
<br>
Plunging in, you drop to the ground and make a sweep with your leg. Pang Xiaohu lets out a shout as he hops away from your attack, but you manage to catch Xuxian and bring him tumbling to the floor. Turning, you immediately launch a strong upwards kick at Pang. He attempts to block, but the force of your kick knocks his large body away. &#x201C;Wait, I do not want to fight you right now, master-&#x201C; Xuxian gets to his feet, trying to get you to stop, but you strike downwards at him with the Raging Claws of the Mad Lion. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about it and just enjoy the fight,&#x201D; you say. Frowning, Xuxian steels his body, raising a palm to counter your attack. Your <i>qi-</i>enhanced strike tears up the wooden boards underneath Xuxian&#x2019;s feet, but in the instant that his palm hits your claw you feel a vast, boundless <i>qi </i>resisting you, throwing you back before you have the presence of mind to begin absorbing his strength. Sensing an attack coming up from behind you, you narrowly dodge the deadly axes of the Little Tiger.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now <i>this </i>is more like it!&#x201D; With a laugh, he comes after you, swinging his axes so furiously that you barely have any time to block. Putting some distance between you and the bandit, you unleash your silk threads, tangling him up in it as he shouts in frustration. Xuxian acts before you can strike: the monk extends his pinky finger forward, pointing at Pang Xiaohu. A piercing lance of <i>qi </i>shoots forth, almost tangible to the naked eye. It penetrates the bandit&#x2019;s thigh, bringing him down as if he had been stabbed with a real sword. Moving towards you, he swings his hand and jabs his index finger at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stupid Xu Jing, don&#x2019;t gawk!&#x201D; Yunzi lands on Xuxian&#x2019;s hand, forcing it down. His finger technique blasts a clear hole in the wood &#x2013; that would have hurt a lot had it landed. &#x201C;I would have dodged it!&#x201D; you shout back. As the girl jumps lightly to your side, she strikes out at you without warning. Of course, you were expecting it. You block and retaliate. Ducking and weaving through each other&#x2019;s attacks, the two of you engage in a brief but rapid exchange of moves. She is faster than before, but so are you. &#x201C;Is that all you have to show me?&#x201D; you mock her, pushing her back with a powerful claw strike that she is forced to take to the air to avoid. &#x201C;If you really want to see something impressive, then just wait for a second,&#x201D; Yunzi responds confidently.<br>
<br>
Just as you are about to leap after her, Pang Xiaohu returns to the battle, having cut his way free of the silk. He hurls one of his axes at you, shouting. As the weapon spins through the air, you knock it away with your scabbard. It arcs into the sky. Pang catches it with ease, swiftly pouncing towards you with a battle-cry. Xuxian intercepts him before he arrives, burying his fist in the bandit&#x2019;s side in a demonstration of the Shaolin Luohan Fist (&#x7F85;&#x6F22;&#x62F3;, Arhat Fist). His blow only manages to drive Pang back two steps. The Little Tiger grins fiercely, but you wipe that off his face with a well-aimed kick to the neck. As you land, you strike at a perplexed Xuxian, who does not seem to know whose side you are on. The monk&#x2019;s attacks are powerful but not very skilled &#x2013; it is mainly his finger technique that you have to watch out for, and he seems unable to use it properly when on the defense. Your aggressive onslaught causes Xuxian to retreat in alarm. Yunzi darts in behind him, tripping up the monk before continuing to attack you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Daxuanwo Tiger Axes (&#x5927;&#x6F29;&#x6E26;&#x864E;&#x65A7;, Great Maelstrom Tiger Axes)!&quot; Pang Xiaohu roars, and spins around in a destructive whirlwind of axe blades, charging towards her. Smiling, Yunzi grabs you and swings you about in a flurry of fancy footwork, as if in a dance.<br>
<br>
The both of you exchange places, leaving you to face Pang&#x2019;s whirling axes.<br>
<br>
You scowl, draw your wodao, and leap forward, right into the path of his attack. Executing the form of the Vermillion Pheasant, you strike out at his axes in quick succession. Your powerful slashes knock away his swings, negating his attack entirely. As Pang Xiaohu falls back, surprised yet pleased, you turn to face Yunzi. She is no longer behind you, however: Xuxian is. He jabs at you with his middle finger, from a distance away. As the powerful <i>qi </i>attack rushes towards you, you bring your sword up. With a shout, you bat it away, deflecting the energy with your sword more on sheer reflex than any controlled effort.<br>
<br>
Xuxian&#x2019;s mouth gapes open in surprise. &#x201C;T-that&#x2019;s impossible!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I didn&#x2019;t know I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to do that,&#x201D; you say, ducking a swing from Pang Xiaohu. You call out to the bandit in frustration, &#x201C;Look, do you have a problem with me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not! I&#x2019;m just excited about fighting you! You&#x2019;re famous, y&#x2019;know?&#x201D; he says simply, throwing a punch at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Better get in line, friend.&#x201D; You meet his large fist with your own. Though he is a much taller man, with bulging muscles, your strength is able to match his. As the two of you break apart, Yunzi appears again, little fiery sparks seemingly swirling around her wrists as she dashes towards you while keeping low to the ground. Grinning up at you, she strikes, bringing her palms together in a forward thrust. She is too quick for you to dodge fully; your sleeve is caught by her attack and bursts into flames. You tear it off quickly, throwing the burning cloth to the floor. While you are distracted, Yunzi has taken up a stance: open left palm facing the sky, closed right fist pointed towards the earth. &#x201C;Here, you wanted to see something good, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xsaora Vairya&#x2019;s most powerful technique.<br>
<br>
You laugh, slightly nervous. &#x201C;H-hey, are you sure you should show that off here-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
She breathes in deeply, and vanishes from your sight with a loud bang, leaving behind broken planks where she once stood.<br>
<br>
Your senses scream at you to move, and you do, attempting to get away.<br>
<br>
The next thing you feel is a powerful force tossing you aside. Yunzi&#x2019;s arm grazes your side in a strike delivered with just a single palm. Her other arm is stretched out behind her, still firmly closed in the shape of a fist.  As you tumble to the floor, you grasp the strength of the move &#x2013; even with her slender frame, Yunzi would have easily delivered enough power in her blow to knock you off the stage. It was only your pure instinct that prevented that from happening. You cannot help but laugh in admiration: this <i>is </i>something impressive that she has shown you&#x2026; and you think that it is not even the full technique. She looks at you with a rather condescending smirk. You&#x2019;ll get her back for this.<br>
<br>
Before you can get to your feet, Pang Xiaohu looms over you from behind. &#x201C;Watch out!&#x201D; Jixuan Wuni leaps in, finally getting involved in a fight that he should know is above his level. He blocks Pang&#x2019;s axes with the chakrams on his forearms, and with a shout of effort he pushes the bandit back. The Little Tiger is not one to give up so easily, however. Regaining his footing, his hands blur in a deft, intricate pattern, swinging the axes so fast that Jixuan Wuni is hardly able to predict where they would land next. Lashing out, he strikes at Pang&#x2019;s hands, managing to block swing after swing. You get up, preparing to team up on the bandit together with Jixuan Wuni.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Pang crouches and lashes out with his foot, breaking the pattern. He is aiming for Jixuan Wuni&#x2019;s crotch, and he hits it, causing the Tibetan to squeeze his legs together and make a strangled yelp of pain. Swivelling around, he chops down at Jixuan&#x2019;s shoulder with his axe.<br>
<br>
You can make it in time.<br>
<br>
You kick at his hand, aiming to disarm Pang of the offending axe. You suddenly realize Yunzi has come to your side, doing the same. Surprise begins to form on her face: it seems that neither of you had expected the other to make an identical move. Xuxian is standing off to the side, wide-eyed, with a finger outstretched.<br>
<br>
Your foot lands a direct hit on Pang&#x2019;s hand at the same time that Yunzi does. The big man finally lets out a cry of pain as the axe is kicked away and hit by Xuxian&#x2019;s <i>qi</i>. The force of your kicks and the monk&#x2019;s finger technique sends the weapon blasting off the stage like an arrow shot from a bow.<br>
<br>
And like an arrow, it finds something to hit.<br>
<br>
There is a scream and a gurgle.<br>
<br>
And then, more screams.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;...<i>son of a mountain goat </i>indeed,&#x201D; you murmur, staring at the sight of Prince Tenzin, still sitting where you had last seen him, surrounded by ministers, with the axe buried deep in his chest.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh dear,&#x201D; says Yunzi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Cockshit,&#x201D; curses Pang Xiaohu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Namu Amitabha, Namu Amitabha&#x2026;.&#x201D; prays Xuxian in a panic.<br>
<br>
Jixuan Wuni watches silently, not saying a word. His expression is frozen.<br>
<br>
The soldiers are running into the square. The crowd is screaming and shouting from the stands and the buildings.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose the tournament is over, then?&#x201D; you ask, to no one in particular, and no one responds.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You make a run for it. You don&#x2019;t think it would be a good idea to stick around. People usually don&#x2019;t take kindly to seeing a beloved ruler die in front of their eyes, whether it was an accident or not. They&#x2019;ll be looking for someone to blame, and you&#x2019;re not about to stay here and find out whether you will be the scapegoat. It&#x2019;s time to get back to the Central Plains &#x2013; you&#x2019;re not going to linger around Tufan territory anymore.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You try to convince Yunzi to come with you. Having her running to the Central Plains instead of back to the Temple may be a good way to shift any blame off of her organization. That, and you think she needs a break from them.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You do not ask Yunzi to come with you. Now that the Fire Cult&#x2019;s patron prince is dead, she might be more needed with the Temple. Besides, if you take her away like that, you are rather sure the Amesha Spenta might come for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You stay and try to explain things properly. It was just an accident; everyone should have seen that. Since the Prince is just about dead, Princess Rinchen and her future spouse should be next in line to rule in the next few seconds. That means Jixuan Wuni should have a very, very good chance of becoming the Prince Consort, and if you play things right, you should be able to get out of this without any further nasty relationship problems with the Tufan. Hopefully.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b> You get Cao&apos;er down here to see if she can heal the prince. It might work.<br>
<br>
<b> 2. </b> You don&apos;t call for Cao&apos;er. You don&apos;t want her anywhere near this mess.

            <h3>九 · Price of Freedom</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Price of Freedom</span></b><br>
<br>
You raise your hands as the soldiers surround you. Yunzi stares at you in surprise. &#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D; she hisses. You reply, &#x201C;Trying not to make things worse, what does it look like? I&#x2019;m sure if no one does anything rash-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You hear a scream from behind you. Looking over your shoulder, you see Pang Xiaohu leaping onto the rooftops with his <i>qinggong</i>, having cut down a soldier that tried to apprehend him. &#x201C;It was nice fighting with you, my friend! Let us meet again!&#x201D; he shouts to you before he disappears on the other side of the building. Before the commotion from his escape has subsided, soldiers begin shouting and scattering from the other side, and you hear cries of &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry! I really didn&#x2019;t mean to do it! I&#x2019;m sorry for hitting you too! Sorry! Please forgive me!&#x201D; as Xuxian too blasts his way clear in a panic and jumps to safety, heading for the city walls.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well.&#x201D; You look straight ahead, at the advancing soldiers.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Killers! Witches!&#x201D; You hear someone call out: you recognize the voice. Zhang Manxing. He is gesticulating at you and Yunzi, and shouting loudly. &#x201C;Killers! They killed the prince. The fire witch planned this!&#x201D; Then, surprisingly, he starts babbling in Tibetan.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He is repeating the same thing, and his command of the language is horribly broken, but&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Jixuan Wuni. A refrain begins to rise amongst the crowd.<br>
<br>
Killers.<br>
<br>
Witches.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the ground shudders underneath your feet, turning the hostile murmurs into groans of panic. As you try to keep your balance, the Amesha Spenta Armaiti lands besides you gracefully, a young woman perhaps only a few years older than Yunzi herself. &#x201C;Holy Maiden, shall we go?&#x201D; The soldiers are afraid to approach; it seems that the reputation of the Amesha Spenta&#x2019;s strength is known in these parts.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, Armaiti. It is best to leave the city in such a situation. There is nothing more we can do here,&#x201D; Yunzi casts you a glance, and her servant follows her gaze. &#x201C;Shall we bring him along too?&#x201D; asks Armaiti, her face impassive. Then, a slight smile surfaces. &#x201C;Or are you putting that elopement plan into place, Holy Maiden? You know that I&#x2019;m obliged to come along if that is the case.&#x201D; Yunzi glares at Armaiti, fuming. &#x201C;There is no such thing! I keep telling you that! Look, Xu Jing, are you coming?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You shake your head. &#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m staying to try and talk things out-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D; Grabbing Yunzi, the Amesha Spenta flees with her before you finish your sentence.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>Well.</i>&#x201D; You look at the spear points aimed at you, and sigh.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The dungeon accommodations are quite inviting. It is better than the ones you enjoyed while in Chang&#x2019;an: say what you will about the dearly departed prince, it seems that he treated his guests well. The iron manacles are well-maintained and do not bite into your ankles, though you could probably pull them out of the brick walls with some effort. You look at the wooden cell bars, tapping them. It would take you only a strike to smash them.<br>
<br>
Yawning, you stretch your arms, leaning back. It has been more than half a day since you were taken into custody. You had proclaimed your submission loudly &#x2013; partly to show your goodwill, and partly to hint to Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er what you were planning &#x2013; sitting down in the middle of the stage, but even then it had taken nearly an hour for the hostile spears pointed at you to be lowered. It took all of your restraint to last that length of time; if you had so much as made a move, you were sure that it would have been a fight that would only end when you made the streets of Dukezong run red with the blood of their army. Finally, your surrender was accepted, and they clapped both you and Jixuan Wuni in chains nervously.<br>
<br>
Even as you wait, the leaders and surviving royalty are convening a council to discuss the freak accident. As you were led away, you had whispered to the minister that accepted your surrender a single sentence: &#x201C;Have Princess Rinchen meet me in the cells by nightfall, or I will free myself.&#x201D; Left unspoken was what you would do <i>after </i>you freed yourself; you let the minister imagine it himself. Your reputation would paint the picture for him. He gulped nervously and nodded.<br>
<br>
The shadows shift, and the light changes. Night comes, and yet you receive no news of the princess&#x2019;s visit. Shrugging, you begin gently pulling your feet against the manacles, feeling the strain of the chains. The guard outside your cell looks at you nervously, as he has been whenever you so much as twitched for the past few hours, and you bare your teeth at him in a friendly grin.<br>
<br>
Then, you hear footsteps approaching.<br>
<br>
The princess appears, with no escort, but it is not the princess you had been expecting.<br>
<br>
Princess Sonam Jinpa, the younger sister of Princess Rinchen, puts her hands on her hips and begins speaking to the guard in Tibetan. He gives her a bow and hurriedly runs up the stairs.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Where is your sister?&#x201D; you ask. The young princess shakes her head, and begins speaking in almost perfect Han. &#x201C;My sister is busy with the political council. Besides, she is rather upset about our brother&#x2019;s death. I am sorry, but did you expect her to just accept it and meet the man who caused the incident?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>You </i>don&#x2019;t seem to be too upset or scared to meet with me,&#x201D; you point out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m made out of tougher stock than the rest of my family. My brother was a good man with good ideas, but unfortunately he was weak to axes. That is just how it was.&#x201D; You stifle back a chuckle as Princess Jinpa puffs out her meager chest in pride, making a morbid comment that you think is rather insensitive to Prince Tenzin&#x2019;s very recent death; perhaps it is some sort of cultural difference that you don&#x2019;t understand. &#x201C;Anyway, I am her representative here, Xu Jing. What did you want to tell her?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;First of all, it was an accident. I am very sorry about that,&#x201D; you say solemnly.<br>
<br>
To your surprise, Princess Jinpa laughs. &#x201C;My sister already realized that, although not everyone is convinced. That is not a problem.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, it <i>is </i>a problem if she is the only person convinced.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We will come to this later,&#x201D; replies the princess dismissively, waving away your concerns. &#x201C;Anything else?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I hope this entire debacle has not closed the door on her relationship with Jixuan Wuni.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That will not be a problem either. He has already been found innocent of all charges and freed, and my sister is a faithful woman. We will come to this later. Anything else?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There should be no repercussions towards the Fire Temple, I hope?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The public seems to be rather angry, thanks to some rumours by this foreigner named Zhang. My sister will be working to defuse the situation. She&#x2019;s good friends with their Holy Maiden. Anything else?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Can I go now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No.&#x201D; Her eyes twinkle, reminding you of the terrible things that happen to you whenever girls&#x2019; eyes twinkle.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alright,&#x201D; you sigh, &#x201C;Time for that &#x2018;later&#x2019; you were talking about. What is Princess Rinchen&#x2019;s plan?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Princess Jinpa begins pacing around the cell&#x2019;s narrow corridor with her hands behind her back, sounding mature and well-studied for her age. &#x201C;This is how things stand right now. Our council is split into two factions. One side supports our distant uncle, Prince Lobsang, who is now ruling in Lhasa. They propose that we reunite the two states in marriage to rid the bad blood between us and make for a stronger Tibetan kingdom. The other does not wish for such a reunification and supports Princess Rinchen, and to that end has proposed that my sister marry one of the brave fighters in the tournament to strengthen Tufan. There are only two choices that would work. This Zhang fellow, who has very good ties with the Tang dynasty and was invited by the deceased prince himself to the tournament. And Xu Jing, who has personal strength and would be a good general for our forces, and actually performed well in the tournament itself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would think that the soldiers would be too angry at the accidental death of their prince to serve under me,&#x201D; you say, and Princess Jinpa shrugs. &#x201C;Look, I am just reciting what my sister told me to say. Take it up with her. She knows stuff I don&#x2019;t.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would if she would come.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Anyway, let&#x2019;s continue. My sister, on the other hand, wants to marry the man she loves, of course. To that end she has proposed a second option to her supporters.<i> I</i> will be married to either Zhang Manxing or Xu Jing. She prefers the latter, it seems. The ministers will accept this compromise.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right, so who would <i>you</i> prefer?&#x201D; you ask, grinning. &#x201C;You would be the one getting married after all.<br>
<br>
She hems and haws, looking away from you, before saying, &#x201C;I suppose you look better than that Zhang. He tried to flirt with me during the pre-tournament celebration. I thought he was creepy. Yes, you would be better.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you for your approval, my princess. So, am I just to sit here and be traded away like a princess in a game of marriage?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Correct. That is what you&#x2019;re supposed to do. It&#x2019;s penance for your crime. You will serve the Tufan state loyally, to the best of your ability, from now on. By demonstrating your goodwill for your entire life, you will make up for the death of Prince Tenzin. If you refuse, you will never leave this place alive.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is being married to you that bad that it would be considered punishment on par with execution?&#x201D; you laugh. The young princess flushes. &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you find out?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That would be nice, but before I answer, could I ask you a question?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If, for instance, a situation happens right now where Princess Rinchen is forced to choose between marrying someone else or running away with Jixuan Wuni, what would she pick? Would she abandon her city, or will she do her duty?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Isn&apos;t that clear already? She&apos;ll run away with him, like how lovers are supposed to do. Really, why would anyone give up the chance to travel the world and see its sights? Now, your answer?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...&quot;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>It is not up to them to decide whether or not you get to leave this place. You are leaving. You refuse the offer. You will break free from the manacles and escape; it looks like there is little else you can do here, except to pay a visit to Jixuan Wuni and advise him to follow Princess Rinchen&apos;s lead.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You break free and find Jixuan Wuni to give him your advice, now that you have heard the whole situation. You also kidnap Princess Jinpa while you&apos;re at it, so that the ministers of Dukezong do not have any more princesses to give away to Zhang Manxing.  If they have ever heard of the infamous Man Tiger Pig, they <i>really </i>should have seen this coming.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You agree to the marriage. You suppose it is for the best even though you are entirely unwilling; you&#x2019;ll just have to explain it to Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er and hope that the princess is okay with sharing. This is the only way you can have Jixuan Wuni as a ruler of Tufan short of slaughtering all of his rivals and installing him by fear and force.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You go looking for Zhang Manxing. It looks like you have unfinished business with him.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You don&apos;t go looking for Zhang Manxing. Let him do as he wishes: your paths will surely cross again one day.

            <h3>十 · Escape from Dukezong</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Escape from Dukezong</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid, princess, that negotiations have broken down. I&#x2019;ll be going now,&#x201D; You stand up, rattling the chains. Princess Jinpa looks at you in alarm &#x2013; she does not seem to have expected this. &#x201C;You might want to stand back,&#x201D; you say, tensing yourself as you prepare to break free. She is about to open her mouth to shout for help when you leap.  The force of your movement tears the manacles free from the crumbling bricks and sends you barrelling through the wooden bars. Before Jinpa can run, you strike at her pressure points, immobilizing her movement. Your belongings are placed on a table nearby. As you gather them, you find that the princess is still silent, struck dumb by the ease at which you broke free. &#x201C;I suppose your brother did not find any use for keeping a very secure dungeon.  I&#x2019;ve seen worse,&#x201D; you say casually. She nods. &#x201C;Imprisonment was not his favoured method of punishment.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;All the better for me, then. Aren&#x2019;t you going to scream for help?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She does.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Excellent,&#x201D; you laugh, and advance on her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-what are you going to do?&#x201D; asks the immobile princess as she tries to put up a brave front. &#x201C;I will not surrender to you!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just bear with this for a moment,&#x201D; you say, chuckling. Then, you bend down and haul her over your shoulder with her face towards your back, like one would a sack of rice. You would have preferred an actual sack to put her in, but you&#x2019;ll make do with the lack of one. She starts screaming again. &#x201C;Unhand me, you foul ruffian!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Someone&#x2019;s been listening to one too many cheap stories of kidnapped maidens, I see.&#x201D; You hear footsteps rushing down the stairs; the soldiers, no doubt. The alarm would already have been raised. The guards of the palace are well-armoured: pressure points would not be an ideal technique for disabling them.  Making sure she&#x2019;s comfortably rested, or at least as well as one can be, you move. The first soldier arrives at the bottom of the steps. He runs into your fist as he rounds the corner, a loud smack echoing around the cells as he falls backward. You step over him and dart up the stairs, surprising the second. He is standing above you &#x2013; you jump, introducing his nose to your knee. As he falls, writhing in pain, you continue to run without looking back as Princess Jinpa shouts bloody murder over your shoulder.<br>
<br>
When you reach the main corridor, you see that it is already barred and guarded. It would take too much time to beat them and unbar the gates; you turn and head upwards as a dozen soldiers chase after you. Vaulting up more flights of stairs, Princess Jinpa&#x2019;s threats and shouts of outrage turn into pleas for you to stop. &#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m getting dizzy! Please let me go! I&#x2019;ll do anything!&#x201D; You laugh. &#x201C;Hold on for just a second. I need to go faster.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>Faster</i>!?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You turn the corner with the distressed princess&#x2026; and find yourself facing six soldiers in an open corridor that overlooks the city below. There are more shouts coming from behind you &#x2013; it looks like you are trapped. &#x201C;Unhand the princess!&#x201D; shouts their leader. Two of them have their spears at the ready, but the others are in an unarmed stance; it looks like they fear harming the princess. That works for you. &#x201C;Help me!&#x201D; shouts Jinpa repeatedly, encouraged by the presence of her loyal guards. &#x201C;Princess! Hold on! We&#x2019;ll rescue you!&#x201D; shout the soldiers protectively in return. You give her butt a good slap &#x2013; it&#x2019;s a bit bouncier than you expected from her figure, causing her to let out a cute little yelp. &#x201C;Oh, hush,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
The soldiers come at you, outraged. Grabbing firmly onto the princess with one hand, you dart forward. A fist comes towards your face. You grab the soldier&#x2019;s wrist, pulling him off balance. Letting go of the wrist, you drive your elbow into his gut. As he falls, you crouch down low, swinging the princess away from an attempted rescue by another soldier. She lets out a agonized moan as you make a sweeping low kick, knocking down two more soldiers. Hopping over them, you kick the soldiers, sending them smashing against the wall hard and rendering them out of the fight.<br>
<br>
The remaining soldiers hang back nervously, sweat pouring down their faces. Luckily, their reinforcements arrive&#x2026; ten, perhaps twenty soldiers, cutting off your path both forwards and backwards and with more arriving every second.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s nowhere to escape, Man Tiger Pig! Give yourself up and hand over the princess!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You could defeat them, but their sheer numbers meant that they would stand a high chance of managing to grab the princess from you in the process. Besides, you&#x2019;re not ready to hand the princess over just yet.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; you whisper to Princess Jinpa.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you mean, <i>don&#x2019;t worry</i>?&#x201D; she asks worriedly.<br>
<br>
You throw her off the balcony.<br>
<br>
As the soldiers scream in horror, you make your own leap while they are distracted.<br>
<br>
Snatching the princess in mid-air before she splatters against the ground, you land on a nearby rooftop slightly heavily, cracking the tiles beneath your feet. It seems that you need a bit more practice. You turn to look at the assembled soldiers up in the palace and give them a polite nod of the head before running off, jumping from roof to roof with your <i>qinggong</i>. They would not dare fire arrows at you while you have the princess in your arms. On her part, she is utterly silent, her eyes blank; perhaps her nerves are still too frazzled at being tossed off the building.<br>
<br>
The main gates are closed; no matter how strong you are you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to open them by brute strength, but you are not planning on using the gates. You nimbly claw your way up the walls. When you reach the top, you peer over it, looking at the outside of the city. Once you disappear into the countryside, your skills will prevent the Tufan soldiers from being able to track you down. As you expected, Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er are waiting there. You wave at them, attracting their attention. Before you can jump over to the other side, the sound of many hurried footsteps approach you from both ends of the wall. It looks like they were prepared for you to come this way too. Soldiers begin to line the wall, surrounding you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It is Jixuan Wuni, the Princess Rinchen standing behind him with a look of concern on her face. &#x201C;What are you doing with Princess Jinpa?&#x201D; he asks.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why would anyone give up the chance to travel the world and see its sights? I&#x2019;m just fulfilling her wish. Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll bring her back safely,&#x201D; you say, looking down at the princess you are carrying. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t mean it that way!&#x201D; she shouts angrily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alright, alright. Princess Rinchen,&#x201D; you call out, causing her to jolt in surprise. &#x201C;Y-yes?&#x201D; she asks timidly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You wanted to marry your sister to Zhang Manxing, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I wanted to marry her to you, but to be honest&#x2026; after what you just did, I am reconsidering it. I should have seen this coming.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s always wise to reconsider your decisions,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;In fact, sometimes it is better if you take a break from it all. Your position, your status, your comfort, friends, family, lovers&#x2026; what is most important? Jixuan Wuni, I have not known you for long, but I&#x2019;ll say this: a relationship is built on compromise from both sides. Accept the compromise that your partner offers.&#x201D; You really have no idea if it is sound advice - you might be one of the worst people to give a talk on this issue - but you&#x2019;ll say anything to get him to ensure that he marries Princess Rinchen, whether he runs away with her or not.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You sound like a preachy mother-in-law,&#x201D; he replies stoicly.<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;Well, just think about it. Now&#x2026;&#x201D; You turn to leave.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I cannot let you leave with Princess Jinpa.&#x201D; Jixuan Wuni steps forward towards you; you see that he is not wearing his chakrams, but he is ready for a fight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You want to take her from me by force?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, you&#x2019;re not going to beat this monster! You&#x2019;re going to get yourself hurt!&#x201D; blurts out Princess Jinpa suddenly. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about me!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s that, little princess? Having a change of heart about someone saving you?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;N-no, it&#x2019;s not&#x2026;&#x201D; She goes quiet, and you look at Jixuan Wuni. He seems resolute, but you have no doubt that you can escape with the princess if you want to.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You have a &#x2018;fight&#x2019; with him and allow him to take back Princess Jinpa while you run off with your tail between your legs. This would definitely enhance his standing within Tufan; he would be the one who rescued the princess where all the soldiers could not. He might even be legitimately considered a marriage candidate for Princess Rinchen due to his heroism.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You have a &#x2018;fight&#x2019; with him and feign retreat due to Jixuan Wuni having the upper hand, trying to create for him the reputation of a man that can match you in battle. You do not hand over Princess Jinpa, however. You will not change the plan now, not when you&#x2019;re so close; if she stays, she may still get married off to Zhang Manxing, and you can&#x2019;t stand by and let someone like him happen to her.

            <h3>十一 · Beyond Tufan</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Beyond Tufan</span></b><br>
<br>
Jixuan Wuni needs no incentive to begin the fight. He takes the offensive, approaching you quickly with his <i>qinggong</i>. Cradling the Tufan princess, you defend against his attacks laboriously with one arm. His speed is such that he manages to get some legitimate blows in on you; you wince as his fists strike your ribs, propelling you backwards. Jixuan Wuni frowns: he knows that you are capable of being faster than that.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It looks like you were holding back during the tournament, Jixuan Wuni!&#x201D; you exclaim. Then, you go on the attack. Your claw attacks just miss him by a hair&#x2019;s breadth, smashing into the stone as you dance around the man, exchanging blows with him until you walk right into the path of his kick. As you stagger back from its force, he stretches out for Princess Jinpa. You discreetly push her forth so that his hand reaches her. Jixuan Wuni grabs hold of the princess, and you topple backwards over the wall, a look of utter surprise etched clearly on your face for all to see.<br>
<br>
All it takes is for a simple somersault for you to land on your feet. The moment you touch the ground, you sprint for the trees, where you had last seen Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er. The gates would likely open soon, sending forth soldiers who would like nothing better than to hunt you down. You will have to leave Tufan quickly. As you enter the woods, you see their tracks, leading further in &#x2013; you follow it quickly.<br>
<br>
Then, you arrive at a clearing.<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing is there, grinning wildly at you, the side of his face bandaged from the injury you inflicted. A dozen of his lackeys are present too;  the two girls are held up with swords to their throats. Qilin tries to talk, but the blade at her neck presses in firmly. &#x201C;No words from you, bitch,&#x201D; growls the thug.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well well, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Zhang smoothly as he whips out a folding fan and plays with it while pacing about in a cultured manner. &#x201C;Bet you didn&#x2019;t see this coming, did you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, but then again, I didn&#x2019;t see any balls on you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His scowl is ugly, distorting his fine features. &#x201C;Such a tongue on you!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;ve been told that,&#x201D; you say, grinning.<br>
<br>
He shakes the fan at you angrily, his eyes dark and hateful. &#x201C;You won&#x2019;t be smiling for much longer. Make a single move and these two beauties will get their throats slit, as wasteful as it would be.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You glance at Qilin; she shakes her head almost imperceptibly, though you can tell that the rest of her body is immobilized via pressure points, as is Cao&#x2019;er. There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be any fear in her eyes &#x2013; she has something up her sleeve. You decide to trust in her and play along.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very well, I won&#x2019;t move,&#x201D; you sigh. &#x201C;What next?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What next indeed&#x2026; maybe the boys and I should just fuck them in front of you, eh? How would you like that? Hah, by the time I&#x2019;m done they&#x2019;ll be begging for more.&#x201D; His men holler with approval. A leer on his face, Zhang Manxing swaggers over to Cao&#x2019;er, a dagger appearing in his hand. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s start with the unkempt one. I&#x2019;m curious about what&#x2019;s inside all those layers of rags.&#x201D; With a whistle, he runs the sharp point of the dagger down the front of Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s clothes, slicing them open.<br>
<br>
He only finds more layers underneath.<br>
<br>
Zhang&#x2019;s brow furrows as he lets out an impatient groan. &#x201C;Well, let&#x2019;s continue until we see something good.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You see Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s fingers beginning to wiggle. Somehow, she has managed to undo the immobilization all by herself. A look of murderous rage surfaces in her eyes as her hand twitches, unnoticed by the hooting men.<br>
<br>
You tense up; you are not sure whether to let her act. You promised Yao, after all. You can reach Zhang Manxing in a single leap. You can do that. Take his arm off before his men can react. Crush the skull of the one holding Qilin hostage, then stab the one holding up Cao&apos;er in the ear. You focus, your fingers steeling themselves for the bloodshed to come...<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Would someone please tell me what is going on here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zhang freezes with a strangled noise in his throat, his hand jerking so much in fright that the dagger drops to the ground.<br>
<br>
Out of the shadows appears Gao Ying, Xiaofang following behind him with a wide-eyed look on her face. He looks at you, and you look back at him. Then, he sighs.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Young Master Zhang,&#x201D; says Gao Ying quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-yes, Eunuch Gao?&#x201D; squeaks Zhang nervously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let the two girls go.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Look, Eunuch Gao, this is just a little harmless fun. You are best friends with my godfather, Grand Eunuch Wang, aren&#x2019;t you? I&#x2019;m sure you-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let the two girls go, please,&#x201D; repeats Gao Ying, more politely this time.<br>
<br>
This time, he complies, desperately beckoning at his men to free the girls. With a few jabs they are able to move again. Cao&#x2019;er runs to you, burying her head in your chest as she throws her arms around you in a squeeze that takes the breath out of you. Qilin just walks to your side, glaring at Zhang Manxing and his men. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll have them dead. Painfully,&#x201D; she mutters under her breath. &#x201C;Are you alright?&#x201D; you ask in concern. She nods. &#x201C;No problem. If they had tried touching me they would soon regret it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Eunuch-&#x201C; begins Zhang, but Gao cuts him off with an authoritative wave of his hand. &#x201C;Head to the rendezvous point, Young Master Zhang. His Majesty is waiting for your report.&#x201D; With a hurried bow, Zhang complies, running off with his men.<br>
<br>
Gao Ying turns to you. &#x201C;Xu Jing.&#x201D; He gives you a nod.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem to have that little weasel whipped,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Why do you keep him around anyway?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Zhang clan is still extremely influential, and he has his uses,&#x201D; replies Gao without a hint of hesitation. &#x201C;I have received a report from Xiaofang on what has happened in Dukezong. We did not expect your presence, and things are moving quickly in a direction we had not planned for.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is Tufan so important that Shun is dragging his lazy ass all the way out here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can ask His Majesty yourself. Actually, we have been trying to find you when it turned out that you had left Yinhu Island. His Majesty has an urgent mission for you back in Tang lands. There is trouble with the Eight Sects.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really. Why would he need me to investigate the orthodox sects?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why would I lie to you?&#x201D; smiles Gao Ying grimly. &#x201C;His Majesty has his reasons, and unfortunately due to the nature of my commitments I am unable to help him with this particular issue. Of course, it is up to you whether you want to come or not. His Majesty was very clear on that point. I do not have the time to explain any further.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You hear shouts coming from the direction of the city, and torches moving in the woods. It looks like your pursuers are coming. You would have to decide quickly.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You go with Gao Ying to meet Shun. If he has come all the way out here, he must have important plans for Tufan&#x2026; though it could just be that he is stretching his legs instead of sitting in the palace growing fat. If the situation in the Central Plains is as urgent as it seems, you should return as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You decline. You will find out what it is after you get back to the Central Plains at your own pace. In the meantime, you will head over to the Fire Temple to rendezvous with Yunzi first &#x2013; she must have gone ahead back to the temple, and though she might not be expecting your arrival, you would like to visit the place anyway.

            <h3>十二 · Gates of the Fire Temple</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Gates of the Fire Temple</span></b><br>
<br>
Five Amesha Spenta; surely a welcome more than you deserve. You had been spotted mere seconds after you gained entry, and surrounded by the most powerful warriors of the Fire Temple. You look around you &#x2013; Vahista and Vairya are present, as is the female Amesha Spenta that had been at Heihu Valley. There are also two others; a man and a woman, who look considerably younger. You presume that they must be the newly selected ones, like Armaiti.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Am I not welcome here?&#x201D; you ask carefully, looking at Vahista and Vairya: from the way they stand, they appear to be the most senior ones amongst the Amesha Spenta. Vahista is the one who speaks: &#x201C;On any other occasion, you would be, but unfortunately your timing is poor. There are some urgent spiritual issues that the Temple has to address right now. We are not receiving any outsiders at this moment. Please come back at another time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;When would that be?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He does not answer, only fixing you with a steady gaze. Vairya, standing besides Vahista with his arms folded, laughs. &#x201C;Go now. But if you are here seeking death by my fists, I am willing to oblige.&#x201D; You are not too sure if you want to take him up on that offer &#x2013; something tells you that starting any fight with Vairya will not be good for your health. The combined pressure exerted by the five warriors is remarkable; you suppress the instinct to flee like a whipped dog. Making an effort to stand up straighter, with a more confident look on your face, you grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would, but I&#x2019;m really here to meet with the Holy Maiden, upon her invitation. Is she around?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Vahista sighs. &#x201C;Yes, we know of her invitation and have been briefed accordingly, but I am afraid I cannot comply with that order at this moment. As I have said, we have some overriding concerns that do not involve you. You should not be here right now&#x2026; and the Holy Maiden is not here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She never came back from Dukezong,&#x201D; says one of the other Amesha Spenta, the young man. &#x201C;She sent us a message, saying that she was going on a well-deserved vacation together with Armaiti.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not look so put down, Manah, she deserves it,&#x201D; laughs the woman besides him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know, she has been working hard these past two years. Still, Ameretat&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Enough, both of you!&#x201D; shouts the older woman. &#x201C;The Holy Maiden has the right to take a break, but it is not solely because of that. She is also protecting us by temporarily staying away from the Temple. Should Tufan want to find her, they will not do so here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I apologize, Haurvatat.&#x201D; The two younger ones express their remorse at the same time, lowering their head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You did not say anything to the Holy Maiden while the two of you were at Dukezong, did you?&#x201D; asks Vahista with a little hint of menace to his voice. &#x201C;Of course I spoke to her. We are friends after all,&#x201D; you reply cheerfully.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see. Friends.&#x201D; Vahista is not convinced or pleased by your reply, but he drops the matter. &#x201C;No matter. Now, if you have spoken enough, I would ask that you depart the Temple.&#x201D; There is a feeling of uneasiness in the air; you can see it on the faces of the Amesha Spenta. Somehow, you feel that it is nothing to do with your presence here&#x2026; there is something else.<br>
<br>
You think you might have an idea of what would disturb them so.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How is your Lord Ahura, by the way?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
The silence is so thick that you could cut it with a knife.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing&#x2026;&#x201D; warns Vahista, his eyes blazing. &#x201C;Please leave <i>now</i>. There will be a time when you can pass our gates and be our guest, but now is not that time.&#x201D; You can feel their killing intent rising&#x2026; if you stay here for a second longer, you will likely be killed.<br>
<br>
You should leave&#x2026; for now.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>If they are not going to welcome you openly, you will just sneak in quietly at night. They are hiding something, and you plan to find out what it is. This could be very important to both Shun and Yunzi. You have already scouted the outer premises on your way into the temple courtyard; you are confident you will not be caught.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You leave; there is nothing else for you to do here. You should return to your wanderings now.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You head north, towards the Tianshan mountain range and Tujue territory. There could be something of interest there, as Tianshan is reputed to harbour powerful immortals that have lived for more than a hundred years, and you would also like to see whether the border tensions are still high.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You head north-east, towards Chang&#x2019;an, Huashan and the rumoured headquarters of the Beggars&#x2019; Sect. If Shun has a job for you, you should be able to hear of it there regardless of whether or not he is present.<br>
<br>
<b>3. </b>You head east, towards Emei and Qingcheng. You would like to see how Master Yao, Abbess Miecao and Song Lingshu are doing; you have not seen them in a while.<br>
<br>
<b>4. </b>You head south, towards the Buddhist kingdom of Dali. You have heard that they are ruled by the Duan royal clan, who have mysterious and powerful martial arts techniques that allowed them to carve out their territory despite superior Tang military force.<br>
<br>
<b>5. </b>You head west, deeper into Tibetan territory. The internal strength of the monk, Xuxian, and his powerful techniques intrigue you. Perhaps you may be able to pick up some clues to that end in Lhasa.

            <h3>十三 · Divine Flame Apotheosis</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Divine Flame Apotheosis</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you going to be okay, going in alone?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You chuckle lightly, adjusting the length of the sash around your waist so that the wodao does not hang too loosely. &#x201C;Since when have you been a worrier, Qilin? Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201D; She bites her lower lip, frowning at you. &#x201C;I still think we should just leave. It&#x2019;s too risky.&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er nods, handing you a roll of spider silk that you wrap around your wrists. &#x201C;&#x2026;Don&#x2019;t have a good feeling about this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It needs to be done,&#x201D; you say, giving the both of them a quick peck on the forehead. &#x201C;I felt something wrong in the Temple, and I&#x2019;m afraid if I leave it be it&#x2019;ll mean trouble later down the line.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, you <i>better</i> come back soon,&#x201D; pouts Qilin. She places her hands on her belly. &#x201C;After all, I&#x2019;m&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What? I thought- How did- Cao&#x2019;er, is it true?&#x201D; you ask in a panic. Of all the times to drop this piece of information on you&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er shakes her head slowly.  &#x201C;She&#x2019;s lying.&#x201D; Qilin laughs out loud, giving you a mischievious grin. &#x201C;Oh, I just thought I&#x2019;d give you a bit more incentive not to act so rashly,&#x201D; she says, winking. You let out a great sigh &#x2013; your heart almost stopped there for a moment &#x2013; and rub at your eye-patch. &#x201C;I swear, you are more dangerous than the Amesha Spenta.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, you know you like it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You gently rap the top of her head with your knuckles. &#x201C;I need to go now.&#x201D; Giving you a wistful smile, she nods. It looks like you have not allayed their fears over this reckless incursion of yours, but you don&#x2019;t plan on giving up now. There is a full moon tonight &#x2013; though it will not help your visibility in the open, the deeper shadows of the moonlight will afford you cover. It is almost midnight; this time you will manage to penetrate the Fire Temple and uncover its secrets.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You scale the high walls of the temple. There are a few guards patrolling the perimeter, but they do not spot you as you gain entry to the interior through an open window. It is the Amesha Spenta you need to watch out for, but you do not see any of them. The moment you set foot inside the temple proper, however, you feel a sudden chill run down your spine. There is a great disturbance of <i>qi </i>somewhere within the building, swirling. Raging. Scorching. It is oppressive and overbearing, and the deeper you make your way into the temple&#x2019;s innermost chambers, the more adherents and worshippers you see laying splayed out on the floor, rendered unconscious by the overwhelming power burning at the temple&#x2019;s heart. You doubt that you could have made it this far unchallenged in normal circumstances, but tonight&#x2026;<br>
<br>
You are unsure whether you have chosen the right time or the wrong time to visit.<br>
<br>
As you near your destination, you begin to hear some faint shouts. You quicken your footsteps, breaking into a run after a short while. You have a feeling that stealth is no longer a concern. You run through the strange architecture of the temple, going down countless flights of stairs, until you arrive in a large, square chamber that could rival some of the halls in Daming Palace. You duck close to a wall, not wanting to reveal yourself too soon.<br>
<br>
At the center of it all is a pillar of flame, pure white in colour, stretching from the ground to the ceiling. It is the cause of the sweltering heat in the chamber, yet you sense that it is not the source of power that you felt. Around the flame stand the five Amesha Spenta, their arms outstretched, desperately pouring their <i>qi </i>into the fire in an attempt to control it. A strong wind swirls around the room, whipping up long scrolls on the wall that are filled with &#x2013; strangely &#x2013; Han writing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s no use!&#x201D; Haurvatat shouts. &#x201C;We cannot subdue him! He will awaken!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s too soon! This is all wrong!&#x201D; cries out Manah.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just shut up and keep working! We cannot let our Lord emerge as a corrupted god!&#x201D; Vairya this time, the tendons on his limbs bulging as he strains to contain whatever it is within the fire. They do not seem to notice your presence just yet &#x2013; all of them are too preoccupied with the task at hand. You see a faint darkness at the center of the white flame; gradually, it reveals the naked shape of a man.<br>
<br>
Ahura.<br>
<br>
His eyes are yet closed, but as his shape grows more and more distinct, a twisted smile spreads very slowly across his lips. Although he stands in the center of the conflagration, he remains unburned, his skin unblemished and unmarked.<br>
<br>
Vahista lets out a foreign curse as he redoubles his efforts, stepping closer to the fire. &#x201C;We must strengthen the Eternal Flame! It will purify our Lord! Tonight is the crucial period... once we pass this stage, his recovery is assured!&#x201D; The white flame burns more brightly and strongly than before as it flares up in response to Vahista&#x2019;s <i>qi</i>. The overwhelming power that you have felt begins subsiding slowly; what the Amesha Spenta are doing is beginning to take effect. Then, Ahura&#x2019;s eyes open: they, too, are pure white, as if the Eternal Flame itself burns within his body. Though you can see no pupils, you get the dreadful feeling that he is looking around the room.<br>
<br>
And for just a single moment, your gaze meets his.<br>
<br>
The Eternal Flame explodes.<br>
<br>
The chamber is flooded with blinding light, the Amesha Spenta crying out as they are hurled away. You raise your hand to shield your one good eye, but to no avail. When you lower your hand, your vision slowly returning, Ahura is standing in front of you in all his naked glory. The aura that he emits is that of divinity &#x2013; a god... but one consumed with madness. He is glowing with power, yet a darkness ripples within him. You realize that there will be no escape.<br>
<br>
Not from him.<br>
<br>
You mutter a quiet apology to Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
Ahura stretches a hand towards you, filled with hostile intent.<br>
<br>
With a shout of defiance, you leap at him; if you are going to go out, you might as well go out fighting. You unleash everything you know against him, kicking and clawing with all your might, sending him stumbling back.<br>
<br>
The living god is surprised for just a brief moment before bursting into a creature of flame and shadow, roaring as his hands blur in a movement that knocks aside all of your attacks with ease and ends up closing around your throat. A scorching pain radiates throughout your neck. You retaliate by grabbing his throat with both of your hands, though it burns your fingers to do so, and shove him hard. It looks like he has no presence of mind &#x2013; Ahura only snarls like a mindless beast as your surprise attack pushes him backwards further, just enough to step into the center of the chamber.<br>
<br>
As if on cue, the Eternal Flame erupts around you, roaring back to life and blinding your vision again. For some reason, the white fire does not harm you; instead, its essence seeps into your body. You feel the impurities in your inner strength being burnt away as it reacts with your <i>qi</i>. You grow gradually weaker, and the fire grows steadily hotter, as if feeding off your life force. The heat is starting to become unbearable. Your <i>qi </i>begins to go out of control as it attempts to fight off the Eternal Flame, with your body as the battlefield. A terrible pain shoots throughout your entire body, almost knocking you out: it is a familiar one, one that you felt once before when Master Zhang destroyed your meridians.<br>
<br>
You grit your teeth, but Ahura screams, and his fingers crush your throat. You choke, gasping for breath as blood begins bubbling out of your mouth, but still you keep your grip on him. In the mad god&#x2019;s desperation you feel his <i>qi </i>pouring into you, attempting to destroy you from inside out. You try to absorb it, to mitigate the damage that he is doing, but the sheer torrent of <i>qi</i> is almost too much for your body to handle. It is half light and half dark, orderly and chaotic, and suddenly you realize what the Grand Taoist had done.<br>
<br>
He had transformed Ahura&#x2019;s <i>qi</i> from order into chaos, turning light into darkness. The result had wreaked havoc and destruction on a body unprepared, unadapted to handle such a change. Perhaps the Eternal Flame was meant to purify and to regenerate Ahura, but the Amesha Spenta may have known nothing about the <i>qi </i>that he now lived with, and its side-effects. The Flame seems to have succeeded in restoring his internal energy to a certain extent, but the process is yet incomplete, and you appear to have interrupted it at the worst possible moment.<br>
<br>
Your sight wavers. This is a fight you cannot win, your strength waning with every second. Ahura has even taken control over the Eternal Flame, as he directs it to destroy you in his pain and anger: your chaos appears to be anathema to the light of the fire, as it seems driven to destroy you at all costs.<br>
<br>
Through the flames you see the Amesha Spenta, shouting in desperation and anger, though you cannot hear their words.<br>
<br>
The scrolls hanging on the walls flutter, strangely unburned. On the border between life and death, everything seems still and cold, despite the flames raging about you.<br>
<br>
From what little you can make out as your mind begins to wander, they are scriptures written to teach a martial arts technique.<br>
<br>
A few words from the scrolls stay in your thoughts even as all others melt away.<br>
<br>
All flows from the Origin and returns to the Origin.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>All flows from the Origin and returns to the Origin. Chaos is the source of both <i>yin </i>and <i>yang</i>, and the two combined can dissolve back into chaos. If the Grand Taoist could turn Ahura&#x2019;s <i>qi</i> into that similar to your own, it might be possible, even with your limited understanding, to transform your own <i>qi</i>, drawing out <i>yin </i>and <i>yang </i>from the primordial chaos. Where Ahura was unable to change the nature of his own <i>qi </i>and was burnt by his own flames, you must succeed. You will attempt, against all odds, to derive order from chaos, wresting control of the Eternal Flame to turn it against the man that once embodied it.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>All flows from the Origin and returns to the Origin. The chaos is infinite in its depth, and boundless in its hunger &#x2013; in the end, all returns to it, no matter <i>yin </i>or <i>yang</i>. You will not let pain nor a crushed throat stop you; Ahura&#x2019;s amateur use of his chaotic <i>qi </i>will not match yours. You draw in and absorb everything you can: you will take in the Eternal Flame and Ahura&#x2019;s <i>qi</i> &#x2013; all of it &#x2013; no matter how much it hurts you. You are not sure whether your body will be able to handle the strain of channeling such power, but your willpower will not be shaken by such petty concerns. After all, you are the disciple of Zhang Jue.

            <h3>十四 · Impermanent Way of the Chaotic World</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Impermanent Way of the Chaotic World</span></b><br>
<br>
You stir the chaotic mixture that is your <i>qi</i>, willing it to move. It circulates throughout your body turbulently, a darkness that is assailed from all sides by the light of the Eternal Flame. The heat is excruciating, burning you up from both without and within. You close your eye, seeing nothing but the light through your eyelid, hearing nothing but the roar of the flames. Your skin begins to redden, peel and char, but you shut out all thoughts from your mind but one: You will not see them again if you fail here. That thought, somehow, calms you down, and you begin to understand what you have to do. All flows from the Origin, and all return to it. The primordial chaos is not an existence separate from <i>yin </i>and <i>yang</i>, but their combined, original aspect. The Grand Taoist has shown you a possibility, a piece of hope that you can cling to.<br>
<br>
To derive order from chaos.<br>
<br>
To do that, you must find a beginning, a place to start.<br>
<br>
It is akin to finding and grasping a splinter afloat on a raging ocean.<br>
<br>
Once you do, however, you grasp the streams of <i>yin </i>and <i>yang</i>, and the threads of <i>qi</i> unravel naturally, as if it were meant to be. The chaotic <i>qi</i> inside you gradually stills, its violent turbulence subsiding into a gentle flow. <i>Yin </i>and <i>yang </i>are separated from each other, each aspect of <i>qi </i>forming a clean stream within you. They begin to flow in sync with the pure <i>yang</i> energy of the Eternal Flame, pulsing through your body while the heat transforms from a scorching blaze into a soothing warmth. You act not by will but by instinct, as your consciousness melds with it. Your perception expands, widening as it encompasses the room even while you keep your eye shut. Ahura is in front of you, frozen in mindless pain, hands clutching at his head as the Eternal Flame blackens his body, bits and pieces of ash breaking off and floating away. The Amesha Spenta too are frozen, but in shock, horror, and fear.<br>
<br>
Before you know it, your consciousness is carried away by the Flame, soaring up past the stone ceiling and into the vast sky. You vaguely perceive myriad worlds and existences, boundless heavens and endless hells, that your mind can barely begin to comprehend. It would take forever to know it all, yet any seeker of the universe&#x2019;s secrets would give all they had to pass into this realm. You hear a familiar voice, faint to the ear&#x2026; it seems to be the Grand Taoist, but you cannot catch his words, only his tone.<br>
<br>
It is one of pride and approval. You do not know whether you are hallucinating his presence; nothing seems certain or permanent in this place.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, it&#x2019;s a bit dull, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; you think, eliciting a vague sense of mirth from the presence.<br>
<br>
It <i>is </i>dull, though. No fights to be had, no maidens to be teased, nor any stuck-up bastards to mock.<br>
<br>
Really, you are not one for philosophical transcendence. Leave enlightenment to the monks and priests.<br>
<br>
The Flame begins to recoil from you, as if it can sense your impurity of thought even though your form is pure. You get a gradual sensation of falling even though there is nothing to fall from and nothing to fall to. The sensation grows, faster and stronger, as you suddenly fly past a giant wall, taller than the highest mountains. It has been repaired with precious jewels in places, fine cracks running along its length.<br>
<br>
It seems familiar to you somehow.<br>
<br>
As if you broke it once before&#x2026; but that cannot be right.<br>
<br>
You continue to plummet, falling away from the wall. A sudden cold runs throughout your entire consciousness as you get the feeling that you are being watched. There is a gaze from far off in the distance, belonging to a pair of eyes that you cannot make out. It seems dark and terrible, yet exceedingly beautiful.<br>
<br>
There is a quiet slither.<br>
<br>
A flicker of intent.<br>
<br>
And your <i>qi </i>dissolves back into chaos, <i>yin </i>and <i>yang</i> muddling together again in a featureless sea.<br>
<br>
The universe appears to implode, rushing in towards you, as pain unlike any you have ever felt before permeates every fiber of your consciousness, somehow replacing your every sense. Pain that can be seen, heard, smelled, felt and tasted.<br>
<br>
Then, all is darkness.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You catch a sniff of something pleasant and reassuring. You open your eye. One of the Amesha Spenta, the younger woman called Ameretat, is lying next to you in bed, her eyes closed in slumber. She is not wearing a single thread of clothing and from the feeling of your body, so are you. She shifts in her sleep, her full body pressing up close as if seeking your warmth. You have no idea how you got here, but your hand drifts to your throat &#x2013; it seems fine, as if Ahura had never crushed it in the first place. There is a knock at the door before you can react. &#x201C;I need to speak with you. I am coming in,&#x201D; says Vahista, and he does so. &#x201C;Are you awa-&#x201C; Stopping in his tracks, the Amesha Spenta averts his eyes and reverses his path, closing the door behind him, grumbling something about overdoing the healing process.<br>
<br>
It looks like there is a lot that you need to discuss.<br>
<br>
Vahista returns when you are presentable, Vairya entering the room after him with a  knowing grin. Without saying a word to you, Ameretat slinks away with a little smile on her face as Vahista watches on with disapproval. &#x201C;She lacks the discipline required to be one of the Amesha Spenta, but we are short of qualified candidates at the moment,&#x201D; he says, though you are not sure who his words are targeted at. You catch the stink of alcohol on Vahista&#x2019;s breath; it looks like he has been drinking even though the sun is still high up in the sky. He turns his eyes to you &#x2013; they are a little bloodshot. Worry lines crease his once youthful face. &#x201C;So, you must be wondering why you are still alive,&#x201D; he sighs.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s because you have taken a fancy to me,&#x201D; you laugh, and Vahista&#x2019;s frown deepens. &#x201C;You are alive because we have no choice. Lord Ahura is dead.&#x201D; Angling his head towards Vairya, he nods. The Guardian of Metal shrugs and carries a tall mirror in front of you. You look at your reflection &#x2013; it seems that your eyepatch has been replaced with a bandage. &#x201C;Take off the bandage, and you will see,&#x201D; mutters Vahista a bit unwillingly. You do so. The cloth strips fall away, revealing your hollow socket. At first you see nothing, but as you stare at your reflection, you begin to perceive a tiny little ember dancing in the depths of the empty eye. Your brow twitches when you do, slightly concerned at the sight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I guess you do see it,&#x201D; says Vahista. &#x201C;That is a sign that you have been marked by the Eternal Flame. For others it may appear in different places, and in different forms, but for you, that is how it has manifested.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is this going where I think it is? This better not be going where I think it is,&#x201D; you say, a bemused smile on your face. Vahista grits his teeth. &#x201C;Loathe as I am to do so, I must call you L&#x2026; Lor&#x2026; L-Lord,&#x201D; spits out the man finally, a grimace on his face. Vairya slaps him on the back non-chalantly. &#x201C;Ah, do not be too bitter about our Lord Ahura&#x2019;s death. This is the will of the Light, and the Flame has spoken. Well, not so much spoken, as chosen, but it is done.&#x201D; Vahista pinches his brow, his expression that of a man who has lost all hope. A single tear trickles down his cheek. &#x201C;I.. I can&#x2019;t do this. Give me a minute. I need to get another drink. Vairya, can you take him down to the chamber? We will talk there.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course. We will see you down there. Now, my Lord, come with me,&#x201D; says Vairya without a hint of worry in his voice. Vahista stumbles out of the room, and you follow Vairya as he leads the way. Before long, you arrive at the chamber of the Eternal Flame where you had confronted Ahura. There is no sign of him now. &#x201C;He burnt away, into ashes,&#x201D; says Vairya. Then, he says, quietly, &#x201C;Just because I call you Lord, and accept your authority, does not mean I trust you or like you. You killed my rightful master last night&#x2026; but I abide by the guidance of the Eternal Flame.&#x201D; You do not reply to his statement, walking forward into the chamber. The Eternal Flame seems to have shrunk, now no larger than a small bonfire, but as you approach it roars to life violently. You did it once before &#x2013; you try to do it again, creating order from chaos. Your <i>qi </i>unravels, transforming into separate, pure streams of <i>yin </i>and <i>yang</i>. Almost instantly, the Eternal Flame becomes calm, coiling around you as you move it to your will.<br>
<br>
The other Amesha Spenta arrive just in time to see this sight &#x2013; Vahista now appearing to be completely drunk in his grief, it seems &#x2013; and as one, they all fall to their knees before you, murmuring their foreign prayers.<br>
<br>
The word &#x2018;Lord&#x2019; comes out of their mouth more easily for some of them now, as they finally accept the reality of their situation.<br>
<br>
Of course, when the discussion begins, the first thing you realize is that you do not know a single thing about the rituals of their temple.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You will not be able to learn them in just a week or two, Lord,&#x201D; says Haurvatat, &#x201C;but you do not need to, for now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ish.. Thish.. Lord Ahura wash our symbol, and we have not yet told the adherents of his passing. We needs to&#x2026; to&#x2026; possh&#x2026;&#x201D; mumbles Vahista, drinking more with every word he tries to speak. Manah, the young man with the braided hair, speaks for him. &#x201C;It will take some time. We will reveal you as the new Lord once the worshippers are prepared for the news.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, yesh,&#x201D; nods Vahista before shaking his head, trying to clear it up. &#x201C;The orthodox bastards&#x2026; if they find out hish dead, they&#x2019;ll attack. Before we&#x2019;re prepared.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, leave the running of the temple to us for now, Lord,&#x201D; says Ameretat as she winds a lock of hair around her fingers playfully. Vairya nods. Haurvatat speaks next, casting a concerned glance at a weeping Vahista. &#x201C;In the meantime, Lord, we have heard troubling rumours from the Central Plains. As outsiders to the land, we do not claim to know the whole story, but here is what we do know. This information is from Vahista, and all credit is due to him, Lord. The orthodox sects are on the move, searching for three powerful martial arts manuals that are rumoured to have reappeared in the <i>jianghu</i>. They say mastery of even one of those manuals will make the practitioner invincible.&#x201D; She looks up at the scrolls lining the walls of the chamber. &#x201C;From what I have heard, these scrolls are a reproduction of one of those manuals.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;sh right,&#x201D; Vahista hiccups as he waves his hand about. &#x201C;Uni&#x2026; uni&#x2026; something&#x2026; I&#x2019;m useless! I can&#x2019;t remember. I can&#x2019;t do anything&#x2026;&#x201D; He continues crying.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all right, I can read,&#x201D; you say, trying to put on a comforting, lordly tone. You turn your eyes to the scrolls. The words come to you easily &#x2013; perhaps it is because of your new-found understanding of your <i>neigong</i>. The writings are scriptures, a strange jumble of both Buddhist and Taoist teachings. You do not fully comprehend the philosophy behind it, but you understand the practical theory that the writer was trying to convey almost immediately. The technique it teaches is called the Wuxiang Qiankun Skill (&#x7121;&#x76F8;&#x4E7E;&#x5764;&#x529F;, Formless Universe Skill), and it allows the imitation of the martial arts techniques of others. The foundation requires that the user be able to achieve <i>qi</i> of a formless, featureless nature, yet attain a high purity of internal energy; this may be why the technique feels easy to you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, so that&#x2019;s how you do it,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Pardon me, Lord?&#x201D; says Manah.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This Wuxiang Qiankun Skill. I know how to do it now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;B-but that can&#x2019;t be, Lord Ahura spent years trying to understand just the first level!&#x201D; blurts out Haurvatat.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Vairya raises his eyebrows in an expression of interest at your words: as expected, he wants to test out the technique you have just understood. &#x201C;You know, it is a pity I cannot fight you without your permission, Lord. Do I have it?&#x201D; he asks politely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No,&#x201D; you say flatly, to his disappointment. Getting pummeled by him is the last thing you need right now; you would really prefer to save such a fight for a better time. &#x201C;So,&#x201D; you continue, &#x201C;How did this get here in the first place?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We do not know for sure,&#x201D; says Haurvatat. &#x201C;It was here when the Temple first arrived, and two generations of adherents have spent their years attempting to decipher its secrets to no avail. Lord Ahura was the first to be able to learn the technique.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He was, was he? He must have worked hard. Good for him,&#x201D; you reply. Ameretat giggles girlishly at your response, causing the older Haurvatat to glare at her until she stops. &#x201C;As for the other manuals, we know of their names, but not of their location. The Xuanming Jiuyin Holy Art (&#x7384;&#x51A5;&#x4E5D;&#x9670;&#x8056;&#x8853;, Profound Darkness Nine Yin Holy Art), and the Xiaoming Jiuyang Divine Skill (&#x6653;&#x660E;&#x4E5D;&#x967D;&#x795E;&#x529F;, Dawning Light Nine Yang Divine Skill). Vahista said that word of these manuals reappearing has spread amongst the Tang pugilists, and I am sure the Wuxiang Qiankun Skill is part of those rumours too. It might only be a matter of time before they come knocking at our door.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;All the more reason to keep Lord Ahura&#x2019;s passing a secret for a while,&#x201D; says Vairya. &#x201C;We will pretend that he is alive and recovering well while making the necessary preparations in secret.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Until the time comes for you to reveal yourself and smite our enemies, Lord,&#x201D; bows Manah.<br>
<br>
It seems that they have accepted you as their Lord, but you feel distant from them: what they are doing now is solely out of obligation and duty, not out of any deep respect or loyalty. The failure of the ritual and the death of Ahura seems to have been placed on your shoulders, and had you not become marked by the Eternal Flame you get the feeling that the Amesha Spenta would have bore you a terrible grudge. You also get the feeling that abandoning your position is not an option, not without offering them an alternative.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you propose I do until then?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;If I am not to discharge my responsibilities as Temple Lord, shall I continue on my wanderings?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That may be best for now,&#x201D; nods Haurvatat. &#x201C;We think it would be better if you investigated the Central Plains personally. As you have learnt one of the three legendary techniques that they are after, there is a possibility it might be easier for you to find and learn the other manuals, my Lord. You should also try to find the Holy Maiden while you are there.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, about her&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, yes, yes!&#x201D; shouts Vahista. &#x201C;Now she&#x2019;sh engaged to you. Just like the both of you always wanted, I am shure Lord Ahura knew that&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I wasn&#x2019;t going to be asking about that, and I don&#x2019;t want to be engaged to her,&#x201D; you say defensively. &#x201C;Like it or not, you are the new Lord, my Lord, and the Holy Maiden will marry you,&#x201D; replies Haurvatat coldly. It seems that your quick refusal irks the woman slightly, though you do not know why.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;About this Lord thing,&#x201D; you begin&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You like it. It feels good. They should continue calling you Lord.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You are not used to it. They should call you by name; you don&#x2019;t feel comfortable being addressed as Lord.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You are to be called LORD MAN TIGER PIG. Nothing else.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You ask them to call you whatever they want to call you. Lord, your name, whatever it is. You don&#x2019;t really care, but they should not stand on too much ceremony with you if they don&#x2019;t want to.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>*suggest a name*<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
It looks like the Fire Temple are asking you to go on your wanderings again. Perhaps you should consider seeking out more news of these powerful manuals that have attracted everyone&#x2019;s attention.<br>
<br>
<b>A.</b> You head north, towards the Tianshan mountain range and Tujue territory.<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> You head north-east, towards Chang&#x2019;an, Huashan and the rumoured headquarters of the Beggars&#x2019; Sect.<br>
<br>
<b>C.</b> You head east, towards Emei and Qingcheng.<br>
<br>
<b>D.</b> You head south, towards the Buddhist kingdom of Dali.<br>
<br>
<b>E.</b> You head west, deeper into Tibetan territory.<br>
<br>
<b>F. </b>You refuse to leave: you are staying at the Fire Temple no matter what they think. You are the Lord and they cannot stop you from doing what you want.

            <h3>十五 · Return to the Central Plains</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Return to the Central Plains</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;About this Lord thing,&#x201D; you begin, looking at all of them seriously. &#x201C;Is it a title sacred to your religion? I do not mind what I am called, and do not demand any certain title, but if your heart does not believe in the words that your lips make, then you do me, yourself, and this Temple a disservice.&#x201D; This earns you a moment of silence broken only by the intermittent flickering of the Eternal Flame. &#x201C;Wise words, Lord,&#x201D; replies Haurvatat finally. She bows her head, averting her eyes from you. &#x201C;It is more habit than tradition. Lord Ahura was not overly keen on the full title in daily usage, and thus we have shortened it to a single word.  There is precedence for your personal preference. I will still call you Lord, for to me that is what you are, and I hope you do not find it as a mark of dishonesty on my part.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very well then, Lord. I hope you will not mind if I call you Lord Xu, to differentiate you from the previous Lord,&#x201D; says Manah, prompted by Haurvatat&#x2019;s words.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll gladly call you Lord Jing, if you want to get closer to us,&#x201D; smiles Ameretat. &#x201C;Or would you prefer Master?&#x201D; It looks like you are not getting away from the title of &#x2018;Lord&#x2019;.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem to have a different way of doing things, little Lord,&#x201D; says Vairya, nodding. &#x201C;As you wish. What about you, Vahista?&#x201D; The Amesha Spenta of Fire is passed out on the ground, in a small pool of clear wine that has trickled from the gourd still clutched in his hand. Haurvatat casts him a brief look of disgust before apologizing to you. &#x201C;My apologies, Lord. Please forgive him for this ugly behaviour. There is no other with more faith than Vahista, and the events of last night&#x2026; well&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Someone is coming,&#x201D; remarks Manah suddenly. &#x201C;Please step back from the Flame, Lord Xu.&#x201D; You can hear the hurried footsteps approaching the chamber too, and you do as he asks, moving to the side of the room. In a matter of moments, one of the cultists appears, gasping. He bows to the Amesha Spenta, prostrates in front of the holy flame, and proceeds to rattle off a sentence in their language. After hearing him out, Vairya nods and waves him away. As the cultist leaves, he glances just briefly at Vahista before running off.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It seems that there are two girls out there threatening to attack the Temple if we do not hand you over,&#x201D; says Vairya.<br>
<br>
Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er must have come looking for you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The sight of you calms them down quickly enough, and the three of you are provided a guest chamber to rest in as the Amesha Spenta begin running about the Temple, preparing for your departure. &#x201C;Lord Ahura&#x2019;s quarters need to be tidied up, but they should be ready by the time you return.&#x201D; Ameretat winks as she closes the door.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Excellent work, darling.&#x201D; Qilin gives you a wide, proud grin after you tell them of what has transpired. &#x201C;With this, you now have the backing of both our Wudu Cult and the Fire Temple.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;your domination of the pugilistic world is not far away now, Jing&#x2026;&#x201D; adds Cao&#x2019;er dreamily.<br>
<br>
It seems that they may have let your takeover of the Fire Cult get to their heads.<br>
<br>
You stay the night at the Temple; you are still exhausted from your exertions, and it is a long trek back to the Central Plains. The Amesha Spenta see you off discreetly the next morning.  &#x201C;I apologize for my unseemly behaviour yesterday, Lord,&#x201D; says Vahista with a tinge of regret and awkwardness. He continues to address you as Lord even after the others conveyed to him your wishes, though you can tell that he is still depressed. Vahista looks unkempt and unfocused, as if he had trouble sleeping and struggled out of bed to see you off. Hopefully there will be enough alcohol in the Temple for him to drink his sorrows away.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Will you be heading back to the Central Plains, Lord?&#x201D; asks Haurvatat. You nod. &#x201C;If there is a bloody struggle about to sweep the pugilistic world, I should meet up with the Holy Maiden and Armaiti as soon as possible.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wish I could go with you, Lord Jing,&#x201D; says Ameretat despondently. &#x201C;I never got to visit the Central Plains.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Lord Xu, we will communicate by pigeon,&#x201D; says Manah. &#x201C;I have bred a good flock that will unerringly find their way back here.&#x201D; He passes you a small cage containing one of the birds. &#x201C;I spent last night ensuring that the pigeons will be able to recognize and track you down no matter where you are, so even if you are on the road, they will find you. Should you have any urgent matter to convey to us, please feel free to send a message back.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thanks. This will be helpful,&#x201D; you say, and Manah bows, apparently pleased at your praise.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well then, little Lord. We will take care of things here, so go on your trip without worry and become stronger.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If I become any stronger, the next time we meet you will not be my equal,&#x201D; you say, half-jokingly.<br>
<br>
Vairya bursts into laughter. &#x201C;Good! I hope that the next time we meet, you will grant me permission to fight you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
On that alarming note, you depart the Fire Temple with Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You had carried a packet of Kunlun&apos;s Fire Powder Medicine with you. Before you left, you wondered if you should leave it with the Fire Temple, as they might be able to delve into its secrets on your behalf.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You leave the Fire Medicine with the Amesha Spenta, asking them to figure it out.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&apos;t; you might need it on your travels.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The little cottage is nestled in the lush forest between Emei and Qingcheng. A small wooden fence has been erected around it, and a garden of herbs is carefully tended in the yard. As you draw closer, you see Master Yao plucking leaves from a plant carefully; <i>zhizi</i>, a herb that helps to cease bleeding, if you are not mistaken. Sensing your approach, he looks up. The grouchy old physician cannot help but grin. Cao&#x2019;er runs towards him. The former abbess of Emei hobbles out of the cottage, aided by a beautiful young girl &#x2013; Yifang, looking even more similar to Cao&#x2019;er now that her hair has grown out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A family reunion, huh?&#x201D; Qilin smiles as she looks at the heart-warming scene unfolding in front of you. &#x201C;Do you want to visit your home too?&#x201D; you ask. The Wudu Cult is south of here, and not too far a distance to travel. She shakes her head, laughing. &#x201C;You <i>know </i>what is going to happen the moment we walk past the gates. We&#x2019;ve had this talk before.&#x201D; You had, during the two years on Maniac Island. Qilin was not ready to settle down just yet &#x2013; for her, marriage would signify that she would have to take her responsibilities as the heiress of the Wudu Cult much more seriously. Her father and uncle were quite keen to recruit you as part of the family, and should you arrive at the Wudu Cult, marriage festivities would likely be in short order. &#x201C;Besides,&#x201D; she continues as a hint of teasing slips into her voice. &#x201C;we are already husband-and-wife in all but name. That is enough.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Later that day, you find yourself sitting down to tea with Yao and Miecao. Your first master&#x2019;s hair is still rather short from the time he spent as a monk, though little else has changed about him. Miecao, on the other hand, is a lot more frail than you last saw her, though her gaze remains sharp and commanding. It looks like the battle at Heihu had taken its toll on the former leader of Emei.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The poison had dissolved too much by the time I managed to take a look at her,&#x201D; says Yao. &#x201C;I was unable to identify it, though it was particularly tenacious. Still, I got rid of all of it in the end! No one else could have, hah!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop your bragging, old man,&#x201D; says Miecao slowly. &#x201C;In any case, the only people with the capability to make such a poison are the Wudu Cult.&#x201D; She casts a suspicious glance at Qilin. &#x201C;I trust her,&#x201D; you say firmly, and the two old people nod, accepting your words without any further questions.<br>
<br>
The conversation turns to the battle at Heihu Valley; Wang Zhengchong had dueled Ahura, gaining the upper hand, his Amesha Spenta had rushed in to save their Lord from certain defeat, prompting Abbot Fangzhang, Abbess Miecao and Qi Liuwu to jump into the fray. From what Miecao had said, it seems that Nie Wuxing and the remaining masters had done a remarkable job of looking like they were helping out, darting around the sidelines of the battle. When the cliff collapsed that clique had managed to land somewhere safer. Abbot Fangzhang had protected the rest of them from the massive rain of boulders that followed the fall with his Jinzhongzhao, but due to the poison that had struck them all, it took too much of a toll on him. Qi Liuwu lost his arms attempting to strike away all of the falling rocks and was finally pinned down.  Miecao herself succumbed to the injuries and went into a coma, and she could not tell you much else. When she awoke it was already over, but by all accounts, it was Wang Zhengchong that had somehow freed them all from the sea of earth and rock.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Never trusted that Nie scum,&#x201D; mutters Yao. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s really a coward deep down inside, despite all those airs he puts on. Glorious leader of all pugilists under heaven, my arse.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is past is past,&#x201D; sighs Miecao. &#x201C;Now, I suspect you did not just drop by merely to have tea with two old people, Xu Jing. You are not the sort to pay your respects for no reason.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I really <i>did</i> miss the both of you,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;But yes, I have come back because I heard of something disturbing. Do you know of the Xuanming Jiuyin, Xiaoming Jiuyang, and the Wuxiang Qiankun manuals?&#x201D; Their wrinkled faces turn pale and grim. &#x201C;Why, my stupid disciple? Are you after those books? Trust me, nothing good will come of it,&#x201D; says Yao. &#x201C;They are cursed. Those who chase after that sort of power will not find a happy end. The stories that are even now travelling throughout the <i>jianghu</i> confirms it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not after their power, Master,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I am just concerned that others will obtain it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If I were you, and I came across those books, I would burn them,&#x201D; grunts Yao. &#x201C;You burn all the books anyway,&#x201D; you laugh heartily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing, be careful about this. These manuals are not something to take lightly. People have died for them, entire families exterminated down to the last child and dog,&#x201D; warns Miecao. &#x201C;The last time they were sought, a hundred years ago, the entire <i>jianghu</i> was consumed in a bloodbath.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It sounds like these manuals have a long history,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;When were they written?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Miecao sighs. &#x201C;Was your pupil always this inquisitive?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Only when it comes to the martial arts, I am afraid,&#x201D; replies Yao. &#x201C;Well, there is no harm in telling him a bit about this. He would run headlong into trouble whether or not he knows anyway. Jing, the manuals were written at different times in history. I do not recall the exact details, but I do remember that the first of these, the Xuanming Jiuyin Holy Art, was written in the late Han dynasty, just prior to its collapse, while the Xiaoming Jiuyang Divine Skill appeared at the start of the Sui dynasty. The Wuxiang Qiankun Skill is perhaps the most recent of these, emerging two hundred years ago.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you want more details, the library at Emei should provide you with some of the information that you need. One of our forbidden arts, the Jiuyin Huagu Palm (&#x4E5D;&#x9670;&#x5316;&#x9AA8;&#x638C;, Nine Yin Bone-Dissolving Palm) is said to be a technique found in the Xuanming Jiuyin manual. Sister Miaozhu is the abbess now,&#x201D; says Miecao. You recall Sister Miaozhu - she was the head of the Castration Nuns, and no stranger to you. &#x201C;She might be willing to help you out. If you really do want to find out more, however, I suggest you head to Shaolin Temple. Their repository of knowledge in martial arts is the greatest out of all the Eight Sects.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; you say thoughtfully. &#x201C;Thank you for the information.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I just want you to assure me that you will keep my granddaughters safe,&#x201D; replies Miecao testily. &#x201C;I fear that in the coming storm, even those who are unwilling will be swept up in it.  We do not have much friends left alive in the pugilistic world. In that case&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Speaking of which,&#x201D; interjects Yao, &#x201C;What about that Song girl in Qingcheng?&#x201D; He poses the question to Miecao. &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t Liuwu say something about that when he dropped by a few days ago? Right after he briefly blabbed about some Imperial constables guarding the Xiaoming Jiuyang manual being slaughtered by mysterious men-in-black.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Miecao nods, and turns to you. &#x201C;You should know this too &#x2013; if I recall correctly, you were friends with Song Lingshu of Qingcheng. It looks like her late father&#x2019;s friend, the senior disciple Mao Sanjiao, has taken over as head of the sect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about Song Lingshu? Is she still there?&#x201D; You are concerned about what you heard of the Imperial constables too, but given the circumstances, that was likely not a lead that you could pursue swiftly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, we do not know about that, but we expect that she is,&#x201D; replies Yao. &#x201C;I just thought you would like to know.&#x201D; Then, he grins. It seems that he expects you to want to do something about it.<br>
<br>
Since you are already here, you might as well visit Emei or Qingcheng.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You head to Emei, seeking out Abbess Miaozhu and asking for access to their library. Miecao will write a recommendation for you, though whether or not it will be accepted is not something she can guarantee, as she no longer has any power over the government of the Emei Sect.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You head to Qingcheng. If Mao Sanjiao has taken over the sect, you would like to find out just what happened that led to Song Lingshu being deposed. She did you a great favour before, saving you from the pursuit of the Black Dragon Society; if you can help her by any means, you will.<br>
<br>
<b>C.</b> You send Qilin and Cao&apos;er to Emei while you visit Qingcheng.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You tell Yao and Miecao about all that has transpired in the Fire Temple, including your current status as Lord of the Temple, and the presence of the Wuxiang Qiankun scrolls within the inner chamber.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do not tell Yao and Miecao about your adventures at the Fire Temple; it is better if they do not know.<br>
<br>

            <h3>十六 · Qingcheng Succession</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Qingcheng Succession</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going with you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look at Yifang, who is standing in your way. She had run out and stopped you right before you left the cottage. &#x201C;Pardon me?&#x201D; She stares at you, looking eerily similar to Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;I said, I&#x2019;m going with you. You are planning to visit Miss Song, right? I will come too. She is my best friend after all, and I have not heard from her in a few months.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;It looks like you are as nosy as ever, little nun. Well, not like I have the right to say anything...&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Please do not tease me, Master Xu!&#x201D; she exclaims. &#x201C;I am very serious about this. If you do not take me along I shall follow you anyway.&#x201D; She would. In that respect, she and her sister are <i>definitely </i>alike.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Take her along, Xu Jing.&#x201D; Miecao is standing at the door of the cottage, Yao holding her hand as support. &#x201C;Whether you visit Emei or Qingcheng, Yifang should be able to help you gain entry.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She would be bored keeping us company all day anyway,&#x201D; adds Yao. You cannot help but sigh. &#x201C;If the grandparents have said so, then I will let that be the final word.&#x201D; Miecao is right &#x2013; it would probably be easier to gain entry to both sects with an honest, upstanding orthodox pugilist like Yifang around. &#x201C;I will keep her safe and bring her back as soon as I am done,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
Yifang shakes her head firmly. &#x201C;You do not need to worry about me. I am no longer the same girl you once knew.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In more ways than one, clearly,&#x201D; you grin, making your gaze obvious as Yifang flushes. A sudden burst of killing intent from Miecao stops your teasing. The former abbess&#x2019;s stony, unflinching glare bores into you and rids you of any impure thoughts you might be harbouring. &#x201C;W-well,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;if you are packed, then let&#x2019;s be off.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, why did you stop being a nun anyway?&#x201D; asks Qilin. The four of you are sitting in a Chengdu restaurant, having spent some time gathering information about the Qingcheng Sect before making your approach.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Grandfather and Grandmother needed someone to take care of them, and my sister was&#x2026; well&#x2026;&#x201D; Yifang casts an awkward look at Cao&#x2019;er, who only gazes back blankly. &#x201C;What?&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er brusquely. It seems like there is a bit of friction between the two sisters &#x2013; Cao&#x2019;er had spent the better part of the last two years with you on the island, and that had left only Yifang to take care of Yao and Miecao in their old age.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you not think you might be a bit selfish at times, sister?&#x201D; says Yifang quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;I go with Jing. No matter what,&#x201D; replies Cao&#x2019;er with an air of finality. Yifang seems displeased; the argument is likely to continue. Qilin glances at you; you understand what she is trying to convey with her eyes &#x2013; she is asking if you want to step in, or leave it to her.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You step in, trying to mediate the conversation between Yifang and Cao&#x2019;er. Perhaps you can take charge and try to find a solution for all four of them to live together peacefully.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You leave it to Qilin to solve the problem between Yifang and Cao&#x2019;er. She should be able to understand them better than you do; you&#x2019;ll follow what she suggests.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The conversation moves to the topic of Song Lingshu and the Qingcheng Sect afterwards. It is a topic that makes you clap your hands to your face, leaning your elbows on the table. As it turns out, Mao Sanjiao is planning to marry Song Lingshu, a girl young enough to be his daughter.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Again? Is this the season of marriage?&#x201D; you groan.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;disgusting old man&#x2026;&#x201D; comments Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It makes some amount of sense. Mao Sanjiao does not have an heir yet. Should Song Lingshu marry another man and bear a child, they could gain enough support to form another faction in Qingcheng, and threaten his reign,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;Right now, the entirety of the Qingcheng Sect is already united behind him. Making the popular daughter of the last sect head as his wife will only strengthen that support into something unassailable.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Under the leadership of Mao Sanjiao, they have also gone from strength to strength in the past two years by pursuing the policies Song Jiangke laid down,&#x201D; you say, laying out what you have found. &#x201C;In fact, they have absorbed many smaller schools, and turned them into branches of Qingcheng all over the country. They might not have the numbers of the Beggars, or the clout of Huashan, but as far as wealth and influence amongst the commonfolk go, Qingcheng Sect would rank very highly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would call it a well-timed move,&#x201D; Qilin says. &#x201C;The question is, is the girl being pressured into it, or is she doing it willingly?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I cannot see Miss Song doing it willingly,&#x201D; says Yifang confidently. &#x201C;We need to talk to her.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think we can just walk in there and demand to see her,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;Besides, the wedding will take place in two days, and a lot of luminaries from the other sects have been invited for the festivities. I hear that the new head of the Beggar Sect is already here, as are the masters of Taishan and Kunlun. I am unsure who Wudang and Shaolin would be sending, but as for Huashan, Bai Jiutian is present as his master&#x2019;s representative.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Abbess Miaozhu will probably be attending too,&#x201D; says Yifang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think I have just about had enough of weddings,&#x201D; you mutter, and Cao&#x2019;er pats your hand tenderly. &#x201C;Anyway,&#x201D; you continue, &#x201C;what do you suggest we do, Yifang? She is your friend after all &#x2013; you know her better than we do.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yifang lowers her head in silence, thinking deeply. Then, she says, &#x201C;I should be able to obtain an invitation if I ask. The people at Qingcheng still know me. We will be able to get in that way without doing anything wrong; they have set up rooms at the sect for the visitors.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They are also hiring more servants to assist with the big day. We might be able get in from there, Jing,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;That way, we also get paid!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps you could sneak in yourself to talk with her,&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er says. &#x201C;&#x2026;you did it the last time with me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Or we could just walk in openly on the day of the wedding to pay our respects,&#x201D; you say, causing all three girls to glare at you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
It looks like Yifang and Cao&#x2019;er would enter Qingcheng via invitation, while Qilin would infiltrate disguised as a servant. As for you&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You enter with Yifang and Cao&#x2019;er, using the invitation to gain entry. You will disguise yourself as best as you can, allowing you to mingle with the orthodox pugilists more easily and befriend them. Even if they do recognize you, your invitation should shield you.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You infiltrate the help together with Qilin, talking your way into service. This should gain you entry to places like the bedchambers and the kitchen easily should the two of you think up some dastardly plot regarding the wedding, as well as pick up information from the servants.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You sneak into Qingcheng alone at night, separately from the others. It would be too late for you to sign up with the help or enter by invitation afterwards, but you only need to talk with Song Lingshu and find out what she thinks about all this.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You will arrive on the day of the wedding to pay your respects to the couple, walking in openly without any fear or invitation. There is no need for you to skulk around or pretend to be someone else.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>This distraction might be a perfect chance for you to gain entry to Emei &#x2013; the girls seem keen on poking their nose into Qingcheng&#x2019;s business and you will let them do so while you head over to Mt. Emei to sneak into the library.<br>
<br>

            <h3>十七 · Servitude</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Servitude</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is this high enough?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Higher,&#x201D; calls out the maid. You raise the red banner up, standing on your tiptoes on the ladder. Careful not to give away any hints of your martial ability, you clumsily fold the banner underneath a tile, pinning it there. The ladder wobbles, and she cries out in concern. You do not fall. Regaining your balance, you climb back down the ladder and wipe your hands on your tunic. &#x201C;You really are a regular monkey, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; Her friends and co-workers have come to watch too, joining the maid in the courtyard. You soon find yourself surrounded by maids and servant girls, applauding your act of chivalry in helping with the banner. &#x201C;You were wonderful! Did you have any training before?&#x201D; asks one of them.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not!&#x201D; You laugh depreciatingly. &#x201C;If I were only a tenth as powerful as Master Mao in <i>qinggong</i>, I would have flown up in a single leap and tied the banner in the blink of an eye! Alas, I am only a humble servant, here on the good graces of the great Qingcheng Sect. But that reminds me, once I saw a certain swordsman in the woods...&#x201D; The girls titter and giggle as you continue entertaining them with made-up anecdotes of flashy martial artists and maidens in need of rescue.<br>
<br>
After a while, you subtly steer the conversation towards Song Lingshu&#x2019;s situation. &#x201C;Speaking of warrior maidens, I have heard that the wife-to-be of Master Mao is a skilled pugilist, powerful in her own right <i>and </i>as beautiful as a fairy. I have not seen her since I came to Qingcheng Sect and I must admit that I am curious.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, the mistress is pretty indeed! She is not a fragile beauty, but strong and confident!&#x201D; gushes one of the girls. &#x201C;Tradition dictates that she cannot meet the groom until the day of the wedding, so it&#x2019;s no wonder you have not seen her around in the main building. She is currently in the east building.&#x201D; Another of the girls adds excitedly, &#x201C;She is receiving her friends there too! When I made my rounds in the east building, I saw the Twin Flowers of Huashan!&#x201D; As the conversation turns from the Twin Flowers into how good-looking Bai Jiutian and Zhang Manxing are, you make a mental note to find a way into the east building.<br>
<br>
It should not be hard; the entire sect is busy with activity as they prepare for the upcoming wedding, and you have found that as long as you appeared to be doing work, they did not monitor your location. It looks like Mao Sanjiao is not expecting any trouble, but then again, anyone who would make trouble here, at a gathering of a who&#x2019;s who in the pugilistic world, would have to be insane.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;After all I have heard, Miss Song must be very excited about the upcoming marriage,&#x201D; you add. The girls laugh awkwardly &#x2013; they seem to think differently. You put on a face of surprise. &#x201C;What is wrong? Am I off the mark?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x201D; begins one of the girls, torn between the duty to keep a secret and the urge to gossip it &#x2013; though not for long &#x2013; &#x201C;To be honest, although Master Mao is a noble and good leader, the mistress does not seem too enthusiastic.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would not blame her,&#x201D; whispers another girl, nodding her head. &#x201C;He <i>is</i> a bit old. But as the mistress says, this is for the good of the sect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Out of the corner of your eye, you spot Mao Sanjiao himself, laughing and talking with a few other men as they walk towards the study. &#x201C;Master Mao is here,&#x201D; you hiss. The girls clam up in fright, afraid that they have been caught gossiping. &#x201C;He hasn&#x2019;t heard us. Go, go!&#x201D; They scamper off, scattering quickly back to their chores in the practiced way servants do. You wait for a while, and then take the chance to creep closer towards Mao&#x2019;s study. Grabbing a nearby broom, you begin sweeping the corridor nonchalantly.<br>
<br>
The laughter from within is loud; they certainly are not bothering to lower their voice. If that is the case, they cannot blame you for overhearing anything. You take a furtive peek through the blinds, craning your head back just a little. You cannot see everything from this angle, but it will have to do.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are a lucky man, Master Mao,  a beautiful young wife at your age! The rest of us have to make do with old shrews.&#x201D; Liu Ye of Kunlun is there, in a jovial mood like all the others. So is Su Cheng of Taishan. There is also a middle-aged man dressed in less refined cloth, more rags than clothes &#x2013; this must be the representative sent by the Beggars&#x2019; Sect. Mao Sanjiao shakes his head and hands, grinning widely. &#x201C;Oh, no, no, this is not luck, but a blessing from Heaven. It is something I could only have dreamed of! Who would have thought that the little girl I looked after from a young age would grow up to be such a stunning beauty?&#x201D; He begins laughing, and the others join in.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We are not expecting any trouble, are we?&#x201D; says the beggar suddenly. &#x201C;Of course not,&#x201D; says Mao. &#x201C;Master You, there will be no issue. No one would dare! Not with so many powerful pugilists present. We have the masters of Taishan and Kunlun here. We have you, the most powerful Beggars&#x2019; Sect leader! Even Young Master Bai and Young Master Zhang, the pride of the Eight Sects, are here to share my joy. <i>Who </i>would dare?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You resist the urge to jump into the room and answer his question.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed, Master Mao! I would say that even the infamous disciple of Zhang Jue would not dare approach such an event!&#x201D; You hear Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s voice, boastful and confident.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, yes, Young Master Zhang. I have heard that you encountered him recently?&#x201D; asks Su Cheng of Kunlun.<br>
<br>
Zhang seems to leap at the chance to tell his story. &#x201C;Yes, in the barbaric Tibetan city of Dukezong. I was there to win the hand of their princess at the request of the Emperor himself, but that Xu Jing played dirty and knocked me out of the competition. Afterwards, he killed the prince, kidnapped the princess and went on a rampage all over the city, slaughtering the Tibetan barbarians. After a furious chase, I tracked him down and stopped him before he forced himself on the princess and took her chastity, but the slimy little snake managed to slip away using her as a distraction. I would have beaten him otherwise! Thankfully, I managed to rescue the princess, saving her for our Emperor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, if he appears here then I shall be relying on you to defeat him, my dear <i>shidi</i>,&#x201D; says a cultured voice cheerfully. Bai Jiutian. &#x201C;Y-yes, of course, <i>shixiong</i>! Leave it to me,&#x201D; replies Zhang Manxing with a trace of hesitation.<br>
<br>
You crane your head a bit further, trying to get a better view of the room. This time, you see Bai Jiutian &#x2013; despite the cheerful tone in his voice, he does not look very enthused to be here. It looks like the Beggar Chief, You, has also picked up on it. &#x201C;What is the matter, Young Master Bai?&#x201D; he asks. &#x201C;You do not look too well.&#x201D; Bai Jiutian shakes his head, putting on an apologetic smile. &#x201C;I am sorry. I am just tired from the long trip.&#x201D; He leans forward, as if weary, but suddenly stops.<br>
<br>
You get the feeling that he has sensed your presence &#x2013; his eyes dart towards the window that you are besides, though from that angle he would not be able to spot you clearly. You edge further away from the window.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; asks Mao Sanjiao.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, it is nothing,&#x201D; replies Bai Jiutian politely. &#x201C;Come, we are here for your joyous occasion, Master Mao. Please do not concern yourself with me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Making a few more quiet sweeps, you leave the broom behind and walk off.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; Qilin ponders your report, her legs swinging as she sits on the kitchen table. The both of you have managed to find an empty period in the shifts to meet up, Qilin having cleared one of the kitchens temporarily with some clever talking. &#x201C;Well, I managed to meet up with Cao&#x2019;er and Yifang just now. Yifang has spoken with Song Lingshu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What did they say?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It matches what you found. She is doing it for the good of the Qingcheng Sect, holding duty over her personal wishes. A bit silly, if you ask me,&#x201D; sniffs Qilin. &#x201C;If I were her, I would have run.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I take it that she has no desire to escape?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not exactly, but it seems that she sees no other way that will not tarnish the legacy her father has left behind. It seems like this &#x2018;Uncle&#x2019; Mao has been telling her a lot of things to influence her decision.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose he would,&#x201D; you say quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What should we do? Do we convince Miss Song to flee?&#x201D; asks Qilin. &#x201C;If we don&#x2019;t know what we want to do here, we can&#x2019;t proceed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Your main goal here in Qingcheng is to:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Bring down Mao Sanjiao by any means necessary; murder, if need be. There is little time left before the wedding. You will have to dispose of him and return Song Lingshu to her rightful position as head of the sect. Mao Sanjiao is too dangerous to be left in charge of Qingcheng any longer than he already has.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Convince Song Lingshu not to go ahead with the wedding. If she refuses publicly, or runs away on or before the wedding day, that is sufficient to cast aspersions on Mao&#x2019;s leadership. He will lose face with the Qingcheng disciples and his peers in the Eight Sects, making it easier for Song Lingshu to take back the sect at a later time once she is ready.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Disrupt the entire wedding to make a mockery of Qingcheng and the Eight Sects. It will be a fine wedding day when the esteemed and noble orthodox pugilists are turning their expensive pants brown.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s settled then. I&#x2019;ll make the preparations needed,&#x201D; nods Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s still some time before the day ends,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll try to talk to Song Lingshu one more time myself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you know where her chambers are?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No problem,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m good at getting servant girls to spill the beans.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I certainly hope that&#x2019;s the only thing they spilled,&#x201D; smiles Qilin. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t play around too much.&#x201D; Hopping off the table, she gives you a wave and exits the kitchen. You decide to leave too &#x2013; you should visit Song Lingshu at least once. She is in the east building, as you recall.<br>
<br>
Turning the corner, you see Bai Jiutian standing in your way, staring at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, young master?&#x201D; you ask, a nervous tremor in your voice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your disguise may trick the other masters, but it will not fool my eyes.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Disguise? What are you talking about-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
His jab comes swiftly, aimed at your face. You block it on sheer instinct before you have time to think, raising your arm and knocking his wrist aside. Bai Jiutian smiles in a satisfied manner. &#x201C;I can only think of one person who would have the guts to sneak into this place. It has been a long time, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who? Xu Jing? Oh, Young Master Bai, surely you can&#x2019;t be mistaking me for that dashing and handsome young rogue?&#x201D; you simper.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Enough games, Xu Jing. Why are you here?&#x201D; he snaps. &#x201C;Are you planning to disrupt the wedding?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why would anyone want to do that? After all, aren&#x2019;t Master Mao and Mistress Song so deeply in love?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He frowns slightly, an irritated look coming across his face. &#x201C;I would not pretend to know the depths of your strange and depraved mind, Man Tiger Pig. You do not need a reason to ruin the wedding, do you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If they <i>weren&#x2019;t</i> in love, it would be a good reason, but I am not a Man Tiger Pig or whatever it is you think I am, Young Master Bai.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Again with the denials... and they have reason to marry even if they are not in love. This is my last warning. Come clean to your purpose here, or face my wrath.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You tell Bai Jiutian the truth about her purpose here and attempt to convince him to help you. From the looks of it, there is a small possibility he might not be fully onboard with this wedding. Mao Sanjiao gaining power also means that he could become a rival to Huashan and Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You lie to Bai Jiutian and hide your purpose here, claiming only to be curious about the wedding and that you have no mischief planned. You cannot trust him; he might just go to Mao Sanjiao and expose you, ruining everything.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>If it&#x2019;s a fight he wants, it&#x2019;s a fight he gets. It&#x2019;s been a long time coming.<br>
<br>

					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">To Steal A Bride</span></b><br>
<br>
You decide to be honest. &#x201C;I am here to stop the wedding.&#x201D; Bai Jiutian scowls, but he does not seem very surprised by your statement. &#x201C;As I expected. Why are you doing this? Are you planning to run off with Miss Song?&#x201D; You step back with your hands up, laughing. &#x201C;What is this, an interrogation?  Why do you care what I do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are splitting up a husband and wife with no good reason,&#x201D; states Bai Jiutian. &#x201C;No proper gentleman can stand by and watch that happen.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yet you have not told on me to Mao Sanjiao.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; had to make sure of your identity first.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, now you know it. Besides, I have a good reason for stopping the wedding. Do not tell me that you have not thought about it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is there to be concerned with?&#x201D; Bai Jiutian bristles, his demeanour clearly hostile. You keep a careful watch on his hands, which are not anywhere near the hilt of his sword&#x2026; at the moment. Tilting your head slightly, you say, &#x201C;Surely you cannot believe that Miss Song is truly happy with this arrangement, deep down inside?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That does not matter, does it?&#x201D; His expression betrays his displeasure despite his words. &#x201C;As a woman, this is her duty. It is how she can best serve her sect. She will learn to be happy with the marriage in time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As expected of the perfect gentleman! Even your opinions on marriage seem like you regurgitated it from some old civil treatise!&#x201D; The Huashan swordsman flushes, glaring in response to your mockery. You ignore him and continue, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t believe she should sacrifice her personal happiness. It has nothing to be with being a woman or a man. Besides, this is not the only way for Miss Song. She can always lead the sect herself &#x2013; she did so once before. She does not have to marry Mao Sanjiao to keep it strong.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian reacts rather strongly to your words. &#x201C;It has everything to do with being a woman, Xu Jing. She cannot hope to hold the sect together for long as a lone female. The world does not work that way.&#x201D; You shrug dismissively, chuckling. &#x201C;You are a traditionalist, it seems. Well, I have more faith in her than you do, then. She saved me once &#x2013; I will not see her as someone weaker than me just because of her sex. I believe she can do it.&#x201D; This seems to cause Bai to back down slightly &#x2013; he appears to actually be considering your words. You make another push from another angle.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Think about it. Right now Mao Sanjiao&#x2019;s Qingcheng Sect is growing in strength from day to day. Do you think someone like him will really be content working with Huashan in the future? If we manage to get Miss Song to call off the marriage, we can kill two birds with one stone.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am aware of that.&#x201D; His eyes narrow, looking straight at you. &#x201C;<i>You </i>seem to be very aware of his movements too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Come on,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;An old, devious coot like him? It&#x2019;s clear as day.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian sighs, and finally nods his head. &#x201C;Very well. For once you make a bit of sense. I must say that my master too is concerned with Mao Sanjiao&#x2019;s actions recently. Perhaps it would be best to see what Miss Song truly thinks about this whole affair. How do you plan to go about it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You smile mischieviously. &#x201C;Can you climb?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You have Bai Jiutian go up first while you act as the look-out &#x2013; somehow, you think Song Lingshu will be more appreciative to see his face at her window rather than yours. You hear him knock, and when the windows open there is a surprised gasp. After a while, he calls out in a whisper, &#x201C;Come up!&#x201D; You easily leap the height between the ground and the window, clambering over the sill. Song Lingshu closes the windows quickly and turns to the two of you. She does not seem to have changed much since you last saw her, though her hair is longer now and elaborately done up in a beautiful knot. There is a slightly more feminine touch about her as a result, and you can&#x2019;t say you disapprove of it. &#x201C;<i>What </i>are you thinking? Do you have any idea what is going to happen if you are discovered?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian looks away uncomfortably, while you grin and say, &#x201C;I just missed you, that&#x2019;s all. Hello, Miss Song.&#x201D; She peers at you for a while, trying to identify you under your make-up. &#x201C;That is Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Bai disgustedly, as if he is loathe to pronounce your name. &#x201C;O-oh! I thought he was a manservant of yours, Young Master Bai,&#x201D; stammers an embarrassed Song Lingshu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So <i>he&#x2019;s </i>who you turn into a blushing maiden for, eh?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let us get this over with quickly, Xu Jing,&#x201D; snaps Bai Jiutian. &#x201C;No more empty words.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alright, alright. I&#x2019;ll cut straight to the point,&#x201D; you say, giving in. You look at Song Lingshu seriously, gazing deep into her eyes and causing her to freeze up. &#x201C;Miss Song.&#x201D; Your tone is solemn and authoritative, and she responds uncertainly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-yes?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you really want to marry Mao Sanjiao?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Song Lingshu frowns, folding her arms. &#x201C;This again? Did Yifang put you up to this? I have told her before that what I want here is the prosperity of the sect that my father bequeathed to me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He bequeathed it to <i>you</i>, not Mao.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is no difference.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you really believe that? Is Mao Sanjiao really running the sect the way you want it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; She falls silent, looking at the floor. You sigh. She is half-swayed thanks to her own misgivings and Yifang planting the seed of doubt in her mind earlier today, but the work is not yet complete. You have done plenty of talking today &#x2013; glancing at Bai Jiutian, who has remained silent all this while, you call out to him. &#x201C;Hey, you say something too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He seems reluctant to speak, but finally nods. &#x201C;I do not want to admit it, but Xu Jing is right. The way Mao Sanjiao is expanding is too risky for the sect. It will attract greedy eyes. This cannot last, Miss Song. His way is wrong, and he only plans to use you to further legitimize his actions. If you think you can speak up and influence him after marriage, you are wrong. He is not that sort of man.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Song Lingshu looks only at him, taking in every word. She begins nodding in agreement. You roll your eyes. Well, you suppose the difference in treatment is to be expected.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Miss Song, I cannot let this marriage go through,&#x201D; states Bai Jiutian as he approaches her. &#x201C;Will you reconsider it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I suppose&#x2026; if it&#x2019;s you that is asking&#x2026;&#x201D; Song Lingshu glances away bashfully. &#x201C;But isn&#x2019;t it too late? What do you expect me to do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You could run away with Young Master Bai here,&#x201D; you offer cheerfully. &#x201C;What? Xu Jing, you did not tell me about this!&#x201D; exclaims Bai indignantly. He seems rather opposed to the idea. &#x201C;I am not running away with Miss Song. That would be&#x2026; well, that would be wrong, for one!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201D; you taunt. &#x201C;Are you not man enough to take a girl away from a forced marriage?&#x201D; This insult finally cracks Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s composure, and he grabs your collar, flustered. &#x201C;Not a&#x2026; Of course I&#x2019;m a man! How could you even think otherwise? But I do not think running off is the correct idea! If you want to run away so much, why don&#x2019;t <i>you </i>take the responsibility for it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you propose to do then, Young Master Bai?&#x201D; you ask, calmly prying his fingers away.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-well, it is simple. Just call off the marriage. Miss Song, just walk out there tomorrow, before the ceremony, and call it off.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That would probably split the sect,&#x201D; you point out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In the long run, it is for the better,&#x201D; replies Bai Jiutian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What happens afterwards?&#x201D; asks Song Lingshu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You will have to gather the support of the sect to stand against Mao Sanjiao.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod, and say, &#x201C;You will be helping  out with that, I presume?&#x201D; Bai Jiutian looks aghast at the idea, as if it is utterly stupid. &#x201C;Of course not. If I interfere openly with an internal matter of Qingcheng, it would look like Huashan has something to do with it!&#x201D; Song Lingshu ponders the proposal for a while, scratching her head in an unmaidenly manner. &#x201C;Look, I don&#x2019;t think it is going to work out that easily. I just feel like Uncle Mao will try whatever he can to stay on top. They&apos;re not going to listen to my words that easily.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Can we convince any of the other Eight Sects&#x2019; members to support you publicly?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t know. I cannot leave this building to find out,&#x201D; says Song Lingshu sadly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I doubt Taishan and Kunlun will be on your side. They sway where the wind goes,&#x201D; remarks Bai Jiutian. &#x201C;The new Beggar Chief, You, is a calculating and suspicious man. I would not approach him either.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What of Wudang and Shaolin?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They have only sent representatives, not the heads of their sects. They will be of no use,&#x201D; says Bai flatly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That leaves Abbess Miaozhu of Emei, does it not?&#x201D; You think her likeliness of helping would be rather high compared to the other sects, but it is still only one more voice. You look at Bai Jiutian again &#x2013; he is the only other person with the clout to assist, thanks to his impeccable reputation in the <i>jianghu</i>. You may have to try and convince him to help speak up, if the plan is to succeed. Of course, no one is going to listen to <i>you </i>even if you try to say anything in public.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You ask Song Lingshu to call off the marriage publicly. You will try to gather whatever support you can; even if it is only Abbess Miaozhu and Bai Jiutian speaking out for Song Lingshu&#x2019;s wishes. It is still possible that it could descend into violence if Mao Sanjiao and the other masters react poorly and claim things like Lingshu being misled by certain quarters to say such a thing: you will have to be prepared for the likelihood of a fight breaking out.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will convince Song Lingshu to run off with you, since Bai Jiutian is not willing to take her. You will have her leave behind a message stating why she ran off, and that she does not approve of Mao Sanjiao&#x2019;s leadership. Then, you will have to see how the Qingcheng Sect reacts as a whole; hopefully, they will begin to distance themselves from Mao Sanjiao, allowing Lingshu the opportunity to return and regain control.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You will convince Song Lingshu to run off, but you will stay behind even after she is gone - with Qilin&apos;s help, you will disguise yourself as the bride, veiled for the wedding. Your body shape does not match hers at all, but it does not matter; you doubt that with all that wine flowing, anyone will pay enough attention to notice right until the veil is drawn back.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>This is not going to work out. You uncharacteristically lose your nerve for reasons unknown even to you and back out from the plan to have the wedding called off, suddenly afraid of the consequences. Perhaps it is just smarter not to cross all of these powerful people. They&apos;re really rather scary, and it would be better for you to run away and hide away from it all before things get worse.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>1. </b>Laxatives as a wedding gift.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>No laxatives.<br>

            <h3>十九 · Encounter in the Forest</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Encounter in the Forest</span></b><br>
<br>
Song Lingshu leads you through the forest path, away from Qingcheng&#x2019;s walls. Having swapped clothes with a female disciple that she trusts, the both of you made it out of the sect easily: they are more concerned with people going in rather than those going out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It feels great!&#x201D; she shouts, once she thinks she is safely out of earshot. &#x201C;If you hated marrying Mao Sanjiao so much, why didn&#x2019;t you resist?&#x201D; She gives you an embarrassed, guilty smile. &#x201C;I guess I didn&#x2019;t really think about it.&#x201D; You wipe the melting, heavy make-up off of your face and say disbelievingly, &#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t think about your marriage and future happiness?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Song Lingshu shakes her head. &#x201C;Everyone was so happy and excited when he proposed the marriage that I thought it was for the best. When I realized that it might not have been such a good idea after all, it was too late. I couldn&#x2019;t see a way out. I&#x2019;m not a very smart person, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201D; You remember that she once complained to you that most of her sect members saw her as the leader of Qingcheng, and not as a person of her own. It looks like nothing has changed, though you doubt that Song Lingshu has done much to change it.<br>
<br>
Duty and obligation over personal desire.<br>
<br>
It is not something you have room to lecture her about, to be honest.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If Young Master Bai had not enlightened me on what to do, I am afraid I would be making a terrible mistake today,&#x201D; she says happily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You speak as if I was about as much use as a stool,&#x201D; you say acidly. She gives you an apologetic slap on the back; the girl is clearly in a good mood. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m plenty grateful to you too!&#x201D; laughs Song Lingshu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Anyway, what do you plan to do next?&#x201D; you ask, changing the topic for something more forward-looking.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, my <i>shimei </i>has the letter that will convey my will,&#x201D; she muses. She had handed over a sealed letter to her trusted female junior in the sect; it will be opened and read to the gathered guests when the time is right. According to Qilin, Yifang too had spoken with Abbess Miaozhu: you can probably expect the Abbess to add a good word in for Miss Song. If you are lucky, Bai Jiutian will throw in his support for her actions too, though he had been non-committal about the idea till the moment the two of you parted.<br>
<br>
You are unsure what she wrote in the letter, however &#x2013; the headstrong Song Lingshu had insisted that she pen it herself. All you know is that it contains a denunciation of Mao Sanjiao&#x2019;s policies.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I guess I&#x2019;ll travel the land. I&#x2019;d like to see what sort of reputation Qingcheng has amongst the people. If there are things that I need to fix, I will do it. That will make my standing stronger, right?&#x201D; She seems a bit unsure &#x2013; she hasn&#x2019;t thought this out properly, but to be fair, neither have you&#x2026; but you do have an inkling of what she can do while she travels.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think,&#x201D; you say carefully, &#x201C;that would help. But it&#x2019;s not all you can do. Right now, people think of you as your father&#x2019;s daughter. They don&#x2019;t see you for yourself. You&#x2019;ll have to change that and make a name of your own in the <i>jianghu</i>. Once you have the reputation, they will follow.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Build a famous reputation, just like you did for yourself?&#x201D; Song Lingshu giggles at the thought of her having an unorthodox reputation. &#x201C;I understand. That sounds good to me. I need to be known as a true heroine and outshine Uncle Mao. The disciples will be more eager to follow me then. Is that it?&#x201D; You nod, and then say, &#x201C;Except for those who are more keen on accumulating wealth and power, perhaps.&#x201D; She shrugs. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want those sort of people in my Qingcheng anyway. That&#x2019;s perfect!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Humming cheerfully, Song Lingshu walks on ahead, a spring in her step.<br>
<br>
You stop.<br>
<br>
Someone is approaching you from behind at high speed. Turning around, you sense the rustle of the leaves as they draw closer. &#x201C;Hide!&#x201D; you shout out, but it&#x2019;s too late. Five men glide out from the bushes, coming to a halt in front of you and Song Lingshu. You curse your carelessness &#x2013; you had been so certain that you left the sect without being noticed that you had not bothered to hide or hurry after entering the forest.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well well, what do we have here?&#x201D; sneers Zhang Manxing, swaggering around as if he owns the forest and everything in it. &#x201C;Eloping with the bride, eh? I&#x2026; hold on&#x2026;&#x201D; The words that come out of his mouth slow down and crash into one another as he gets a good look at your face. &#x201C;Man Tiger Pig,&#x201D; he hisses, a tinge of fear in his eyes. His hand floats unconsciously to his wounded ear. His men look at each other nervously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hello again, Young Master Zhang,&#x201D; you say lightly. &#x201C;Do you have any business with me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With an effort of will, he regains control of himself, the sneer returning as if it never left. &#x201C;Now I do. What are you doing all the way out here with Miss Song? Oh, are the two of you having an affair?&#x201D; He licks his lips. &#x201C;Come on, Miss Song, if you wanted to release your frustrations from being paired with an old geezer like Mao Sanjiao, you only had to ask me. I can guarantee your satisfaction in bed. There is no need to resort to sleeping with a flea-ridden dog like him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have always thought you were a creepy scumbag from the moment I first saw you,&#x201D; snorts Song Lingshu, rolling up her sleeves. &#x201C;No thank you, Zhang Manxing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What a painful rejection,&#x201D; he groans mockingly. &#x201C;Well, never mind.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Surely you didn&#x2019;t ride all the way out here to talk about your sexual prowess, Young Master Zhang?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not. I came here to retrieve the bride. I overheard my most respected <i>shixiong</i> quietly agonizing to himself about Miss Song running away. When I confronted him, he caved in and told me about the escape. It seems that he was too cowardly to give chase, but I have no such fear holding me back.&#x201D; Zhang Manxing appears to have forgotten about the fear he expressed when he first discerned your identity&#x2026; or perhaps he never noticed it himself.<br>
<br>
Song Lingshu frowns, clearly shaken by what Zhang has just said. &#x201C;Young Master Bai would never&#x2026;&#x201D; she whispers, her fists balling up tightly. Then, she looks at you and says, &#x201C;Xu Jing, can we just beat them up and go, already?&#x201D; Her tone is impatient and you can sense a thirst for battle in her movements. &#x201C;This creep has had a beating a long time coming.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A beating? Don&#x2019;t get cocky! This time the fight is going to be different, Man Tiger Pig!&#x201D; shouts Zhang Manxing in response. &#x201C;You got lucky last time in Tufan! I was holding back! Now, you will be witness to my full skill&#x2026; you will not leave this mountain standing on your feet!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now that is something to fear,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;Did you come with just your four friends back there? Surely you didn&#x2019;t tell anyone else about this, did you? They could have stolen your credit.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course! I am the one who pressed my <i>shixiong </i>for information, I am the one who will rescue the bride, I am the one who will defeat the Man Tiger Pig today. I am not as stupid as someone like you; how could I get the credit for my hard work if I told anyone else?&#x201D; Zhang seems to be telling the truth about this, at least. You believe that he is actually smart enough to come alone. He extends his arms and goes into a fighting stance confidently, as do his lackeys. It looks like the time for words is over.<br>
<br>
You could fight him, but you are unsure if Bai Jiutian had been &#x2018;overheard&#x2019; by anyone else. It is possible that there could be reinforcements on the way to back up Zhang Manxing, though it is also possible that these are the only pursuers that will come after you: after all, if he had betrayed you to Mao Sanjiao, there were plenty of opportunities to do so <i>before </i>you left the sect, and Qingcheng would have been the first on your tail even if he did so after you left.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You fight to kill. You will not leave him alive to report your identity back to the orthodox sects; since he and his lackeys came here without informing anyone else, you can eliminate all the witnesses in a single fight. It is time to finish him off before he becomes a bigger pain.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do not fight to kill. Song Lingshu would not approve of it; if you went all out with killing intent, she would definitely be disturbed. It should not be too difficult to disable Zhang Manxing and his lackeys with your skill, and with Song Lingshu fighting alongside you.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You use the Wuxiang Qiankun Skill. It is a technique that you will understand better and improve quicker if you use it in a real fight. It is unlikely someone like Zhang Manxing will perceive the nature of the skill anyway.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You don&#x2019;t use the Wuxiang Qiankun Skill. You cannot risk anyone knowing about it just yet; you&#x2019;d like to keep your ability to use it a secret for a while longer. You will have other opportunities to practice it in battle.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You grab Song Lingshu and make a run for it. With your skills you can lose them easily in the forest. You are still not sure whether there may be more pursuers on the way; you gain nothing from fighting Zhang Manxing here but the loss of valuable time. It is more important that you distance yourself from the mountain as soon as possible.<br>
<br>

            <h3>二十 · Four Lions Formation</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Four Lions Formation</span></b><br>
<br>
The moment your killing intent is fully unshackled, birds flee the trees and all that is left in the forest is the gentle whisper of the wind. &#x201C;H-hey&#x2026;&#x201D; Song Lingshu raises her hand towards you tentatively, unnerved by the murderous feeling radiating from your presence. You ignore her, focusing intently on the men ahead of you: this is not merely going all out, this is a fight where you have no intention of letting any of them leave alive. Here is the man who would have violated Qilin and Cao&#x2019;er, and the ones that crowd around him. You take a step forward, just one step closer to Zhang Manxing, and his lackeys burst into action, diving in front of him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll take on Zhang Manxing!&#x201D; shouts Song Lingshu, running past you as she draws her sword &#x2013; it seems that she does not want to stay too close to you as you are now, and would rather throw herself into a fight. She passes Zhang&#x2019;s lackeys, but they do not stop her; instead, the entirety of their concentration seems to be focused on you. It looks like they are not just any run-of-the-mill thugs that Zhang picked up by the street&#x2026; they recognize who the bigger threat to their master is, and are prioritizing accordingly. They are not amateurs.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Were you trained by the palace guards, by any chance?&#x201D; you ask. They have taken up a rather interesting, wall-like formation with their swords raised, orderly and imposing. &#x201C;We are the elite bodyguards of the Zhang clan, the Protector Lions,&#x201D; says one of them. &#x201C;You will not pass.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I rather think I will,&#x201D; you say, and charge towards them. Their movements are crisp and well-drilled &#x2013; they may not be anywhere near as fast as you are, but the formation that they have memorized makes up for that. Moving as one, they support each other and box you in, relentlessly making up for one another&#x2019;s shortcomings. &#x201C;Interesting formation!&#x201D; you shout out, blocking and parrying their swords with your own. &#x201C;What is it called?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is the esteemed Shishi Formation (&#x56DB;&#x7345;&#x9663;, Four Lions Formation)! You will not get to the young master for we will stop you here!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Amusing!&#x201D; you laugh. You could probably destroy their formation quickly with your Shouwang Claws or Wuying Leipo Kick, but perhaps this would be a good test to see just how far your Wuxiang Qiankun Skill can go. You gather your <i>qi </i>and separate the streams calmly. <i>Yin </i>towards the left, <i>yang </i>towards the right. The movements of the formation become clear to you as the flow of <i>qi </i>in your body starts to mirror their own. You move, slotting in perfectly into the patterns of the Shishi Formation. They barely have enough time to be surprised.<br>
<br>
Drawing the Yuchang Sword, you go on the attack with a blade in both hands. You replicate the steps of the four-man Shishi Formation just by yourself, suppressing theirformation as you dismantle its patterns. Soon, <i>you</i> are the one boxing the four in, dancing around them and keeping them on the defensive.<br>
<br>
Their formation breaks.<br>
<br>
You drive the Yuchang Sword through the chest of one, the sharp blade sinking in so easily that you feel like you are stabbing air. You twist and cut, passing the sword through his ribs as you spin and take off the head of another bodyguard with your wodao. Following through with the movement, you suddenly reverse the direction of the cut and slash downwards, catching the third with a clean slice right through his torso. Droplets of blood fly through the air, blossoming into crimson petals wherever they fall.<br>
<br>
The fourth is already beginning to run, turning his back to you.<br>
<br>
Sheathing the wodao, you lunge forward, impaling him with the Bloody Diamond Horn. Your claws crush his spine, snapping it as your fingers drive deep into his back. You can briefly feel his heart beating wildly beneath your fingertips. He falls forward, as dead as his comrades. You flick your fingers downwards, allowing the deep red blood that stains them to spatter across the ground.<br>
<br>
You turn towards Song Lingshu and Zhang Manxing. Song Lingshu actually appears to be driving him back, but the instant your attention falls upon them, she cannot help but disengage from their fight, distracted by your powerful killing intent. Song Lingshu&#x2019;s face goes pale, while Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s expression is suffused with intense fear at the sight of the swift, merciless deaths you have given his men. To his credits, his knees do not buckle and he does not freeze up, but he immediately turns, attempting to flee.<br>
<br>
You leap towards him, covering the distance in a single bound. Before he can react, you allow your <i>qi </i>to collapse into chaos as you summon all your strength, raking your claws downwards and across his body.<br>
<br>
Blood spills. Red flecks rise into the air, but it is not his blood. It flows from your fingers.<br>
<br>
His tunic is torn apart by your blow, revealing the protective metal vest that he wears underneath. It is lined with countless tiny, sharp needles. The vest too is irreparably damaged where you have struck it, but the only injury he has suffered from your attack surfaces in the form of deep, bleeding furrows running down the length of his torso. His eyes are still bulging in surprise at the speed and strength of your attack. The vest saved him from certain death &#x2013; he would have been torn in two if he had not been wearing it.<br>
<br>
A sharp pain shoots up your arm, spreading from your injured hand. The tips of your fingers have been shredded and punctured by the needles, and you realize that they have also been poisoned. You are forced to your knees by a sudden light-headedness. You begin redirecting your internal energy to battle the poison &#x2013; it is nothing too severe, compared to some of the toxins you have read about. &#x201C;Xu Jing!&#x201D; calls out Song Lingshu, her voice filled with concern as she runs to your side.  Looking up angrily, she attempts to grab the fleeing Zhang. &#x201C;Zhang Manxing, you despicable wretch! Using a poisoned vest? Hand over the antidote!&#x201D; He hops back, his face full of panic as he spots you slowly rising back to your feet. In fear for his life, he decides to throw everything he has at you to survive. Reaching inside his tattered clothes, he draws out a small pouch and empties its contents towards you and Song Lingshu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Watch out!&#x201D; You finally find the strength in your throat to shout out, but it is too late.<br>
<br>
A yellow, sweet-smelling powder, light enough to float in the air, expands in a large cloud. You wave your hand hard, using the force of your <i>qi </i>to bat away most of the powder, but Song Lingshu is caught halfway reaching for Zhang, and takes the brunt of what is left right in her face. She stumbles immediately, falling back &#x2013; you stretch out and catch her. You hear the crashing of branches as Zhang Manxing disappears into the bushes, desperately putting as much distance between you and him as he can. Say what you want about that slippery bastard, his <i>qinggong </i>is quite well-suited to running away &#x2013; he is out of sight in a split second. Gritting your teeth, you attempt to get up and chase him, but a hot warmth rushes through your body, making your legs weak. You are forced back to your knees, cradling Song in your arms. It looks like you inhaled a small amount of that powder by accident too.<br>
<br>
You look down at Song Lingshu; her face is flushed and her body feverish. Her eyelids are trembling and half-closed. You scoop her up in your arms; she lets out a loud gasp, shuddering, and strangely falls into a daze, staring blankly at you as she breathes heavily. Her cheeks blush visibly. At this rate, you cannot waste any more time here &#x2013; if you do not make it down the mountain and to the rendezvous point quickly, things might go from bad to worse very soon.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is the Chunfeng Huafen (&#x6625;&#x98A8;&#x82B1;&#x7C89;,Spring Wind Pollen). A very powerful aphrodisiac, Jing&#x2026;&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the same one that he tried to use on us in Tufan, I believe,&#x201D; adds Qilin. You had arranged to meet up with the rest of your party at the same hut you had once used when rescuing Cao&#x2019;er &#x2013; they had arrived before you did, your travel speed slowed down by the effects of Zhang&#x2019;s powder. Cao&#x2019;er continues her explanation:  &#x201C;&#x2026;with that much dosage, if it is not purged from her body, her body will give out from the strain.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, how do we do it?&#x201D; You are still feeling a bit of the effects yourself; it is not a drug that can be neutralized easily with just <i>neigong</i>. Song Lingshu&#x2019;s moans from the bedroom do not help your condition any. &#x201C;&#x2026;the easiest way is to bed her&#x2026;&#x201D; says the genius physician bluntly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;make her Number Three,&#x201D; she nods.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-you can&#x2019;t!&#x201D; stammers Yifang, shocked by the discussion. &#x201C;Is there no other way?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is the safest way,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;Or perhaps you would like to do it, Yifang?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I can&#x2019;t,&#x201D; squeaks the former nun.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then we need someone who can,&#x201D; grins Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, if that is the easiest way, what is the harder way?&#x201D; you ask &#x2013; surely there has to be some other method.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can make an antidote&#x2026;&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er nods. &#x201C;&#x2026;but the ingredients need to be bought&#x2026; need to go to Chengdu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, it isn&#x2019;t too expensive,&#x201D; Qilin says, &#x201C;but it takes some time to prepare. Miss Song will just have to hold out for a few days.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You &#x2018;cure&#x2019; her, if that is what it takes. It is partially your fault that she got hit by the aphrodisiac anyway &#x2013; had you not injured yourself, she would not have run over out of concern. You have to take responsibility sincerely.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You persuade Yifang to &#x2018;cure&#x2019; her, if it works that way too. She is her best friend after all, and you think it would be more acceptable to Song Lingshu to have Yifang take the role of being the one that purges the pollen from her body.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You would rather hold out for the antidote. You will purchase the ingredients and have Song Lingshu hold out for a few more days so that Cao&#x2019;er can prepare it properly. You are not very sure if Miss Song would appreciate the traditional curing method all that much.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Qilin worked hard to gather information about the happenings in Qingcheng after it was found out that Song Lingshu ran away from the marriage. It seems that the Abbess Miaozhu, the Wu Brothers of Wudang, Guo Fu, and the Xu monks of Shaolin had attempted to put in a good word for Song Lingshu, portraying her as a girl who has always known right from wrong. At the same time, Bai Jiutian cast aspersions on Mao Sanjiao&#x2019;s ambitions in a far more subtler manner than Song Lingshu&#x2019;s own words - the contrast in approach worked extremely well, nudging public opinion against Mao in a polite manner beyond reproach.<br>
<br>
Then, Zhang Manxing arrived, bleeding profusely all over Qingcheng&#x2019;s shiny floor.<br>
<br>
He made his courageous report of how he fought off the vicious Man Tiger Pig and Song Lingshu. Bai Jiutian was utterly shocked that the man he spotted turned out to be Xu Jing, and blamed himself for telling Zhang and getting his <i>shidi </i>into mortal danger.<br>
<br>
Strangely, Zhang Manxing had divested himself of that vest before he arrived at Qingcheng &#x2013; none of the orthodox pugilists saw it.<br>
<br>
At first, the pugilists of Emei, Shaolin and Wudang did not believe Zhang Manxing, but upon checking his wounds, and finding the bodies of his bodyguards in the forest, they had no choice but to admit that this was your handiwork. The traces of distinctive, chaotic <i>qi</i> that you left behind in their wounds were enough to confirm your presence.<br>
<br>
Instead of outrage, they seemed to have expressed disappointment.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian seemed to be rather interested in examining the bodies of the bodyguards, though he ended up making no conclusions... at least none that he shared.<br>
<br>
In the end, the public sentiment amongst the pugilistic community appeared to be that Song Lingshu had fallen into bad company, but the deaths were nothing they did not already expect from Xu Jing. How they would react from now on was anybody&apos;s guess.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I appreciate the thought, but you didn&#x2019;t need to go after Zhang Manxing,&#x201D; sighs Qilin. &#x201C;It was safer to just run. You know how our reputation is like anyway.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is done is done, I suppose?&#x201D; You try to smile awkwardly. &#x201C;Oh, cheer up!&#x201D; Qilin gives you a tight hug. &#x201C;While you were busy sneaking Miss Song out, I went into the laundry and put some experimental ointment in Zhang&#x2019;s undergarments.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really? What does it do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a refined, non-contagious version of a rare toxin sample my uncle brought back from overseas. He calls it Meihua Poison (&#x6885;&#x82B1;&#x6BD2;,Plum Flower Poison), but it is not extracted from plum flowers at all. We are holding out high hopes for this product&#x2026; it is slow-acting, indistinguishable from other sex sicknesses, and should rot his pecker right off! Oh, and give him ugly sores all over and eventually culminate in blindness, agony, and death.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You stare at Qilin. &#x201C;You said non-contagious. It means that there is a contagious version?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, the Wudu Cult refined it. It&#x2019;ll only affect the target, thanks to our special ointment!&#x201D; she says proudly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you <i>very </i>sure?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very sure. Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Perhaps you shouldn&#x2019;t worry about it, or ask too much about these matters&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Yes, that&apos;s right. There are more important things for you to think about.<br>
<br>
Like where you should go next.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You decide to go to Emei to read about the Jiuyin Huagu Palm. It is rather certain that you won&#x2019;t be very welcome there at the moment, but you don&#x2019;t think they can stop you from sneaking into the library if you wanted to.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You head north, towards Chang&#x2019;an. It seems that Shun&#x2019;s imperial constables had a lead on the Xiaoming Jiuyang Divine Skill manual, and were actually in possession of it for a brief period of time. It would be a good track for you to follow up on.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You head east, towards Yuhua Hall. The orthodox sects surely have their own leads and ways of pursuing the manuals, but you have your own contacts that they would find it hard to draw upon. Perhaps the ladies of the hall could give you some clues.<br>
<br>

					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Journey to Chang&#x2019;an</span></b><br>
<br>
You sit in the room alone, meditating. At least, you try to &#x2013; your attention wanders to the two girls, Yifang and Lingshu. Taking your advice, Yifang had decided to spend more time with Cao&#x2019;er in order to strengthen their sisterly bonds. A message from Yao and Miecao indicated that they approved of this decision &#x2013; nothing would please them more than to see their two granddaughters get along.<br>
<br>
Miss Song, on the other hand&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You open your eye, glancing at Song Lingshu. &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t aware that I did anything that required thanking,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I was&#x2026; affected by that powder&#x2026;&#x201D; she says awkwardly. &#x201C;I had expected you to take advantage of me, but you didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You arch an eyebrow in surprise. Her face turns red as she is unable to meet your gaze.  &#x201C;Miss Song, what do you take me for? I might be a killer, but I would not stoop to that sort of behaviour.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Though Lingshu frowns as she remembers the corpses of Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s bodyguards, she takes a deep breath and then laughs brightly. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Besides, you wouldn&#x2019;t lust after me when you already have two beautiful women by your side,&#x201D; she teases.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you think that I <i>wasn&#x2019;t </i>tempted, then you would be wrong. But it wouldn&#x2019;t have been right in that situation,&quot; you say, grinning.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;O-oh.&#x201D; She seems stunned by your words, but plays it off quickly as she composes herself and moves on to the next topic&#x2026; one that you had been dreading. &#x201C;Regardless, Xu Jing, I have something to ask you. Are you&#x2026; were you the Killer Physician&#x2019;s apprentice?&#x201D; Her face is serious now. Deadly serious.<br>
<br>
You nod. There is no point hiding it; not that you <i>were </i>actually hiding it from her. She has already heard about it from Yifang. &#x201C;Yes, I am.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She sighs. &#x201C;What a day it is. Fate is ludicrous. To think that my best friend is the granddaughter of my father&#x2019;s killer, her twin is his apprentice that I once captured, and the only boy outside of Qingcheng that I got along with is <i>also </i>his disciple.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;When you put it like that, yes, it does sound ludicrous. Perhaps you should pray to the gods to change your fate.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She continues, &#x201C;I am not going to forgive Yao Shunshi for my father&#x2019;s death. I can understand if he tried to take my life, in accordance with his principles, but he should not have killed my father, the very man he had just cured.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have heard the whole story, right?&#x201D; you ask. You wonder why she is talking about this to you, when you have not been his apprentice in a while and his two granddaughters were right out there, in the other room.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, but that does not make it any better. If he truly wanted to take my father&#x2019;s life in recompense for my own, then why did he not do so at the time? Why did he wait so long, until my father was forced to call upon him again, to strike, so that he could kill both of us, father and daughter? Is that not purposely cruel and vengeful?&#x201D; Lingshu is angry; it seems that she can be rather hot-tempered.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do not presume to guess what Master Yao had in mind, but your father was not pressured into calling him. No one forced Master Song to call upon the Killer Physician again.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Still-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Even if he had killed Master Song seven years ago, would you have accepted it? Would you have <i>not </i>sworn vengeance against the one who took your father&#x2019;s life?&#x201D; You get up from the bed as Lingshu stares defiantly at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It would have been better,&#x201D; she says stubbornly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Better that you did not get the chance to spend another five years with your father, or better that Master Yao would not have returned and asked for your life in payment?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your father knew what my master&#x2019;s payment was going to be. Those are my master&#x2019;s code, the principles that he lives by.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They are <i>wrong </i>principles. One should not ask for a life to save a life.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nevertheless, they are his principles, and he does not save a life unless he is asked to. He did not come knocking on Qingcheng&#x2019;s door, asking to be allowed to save you or your father.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t need to save me-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s what you think. Your father evidently thought different. He also thought that he could force my master to break his principles through bribery or violence.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Lingshu&#x2019;s eyes flash dangerously at your words about her father, but this is something you have to say now that the subject has been raised. You press on.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Song was concerned for your life at the time, but does that mean he gets to trample over the principles of another man? One that he invited into his house, knowing full well the price he had to pay?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, he should not have, but-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Or are you really thinking Master Yao should have killed your father all those years ago, so that he would not return later and threaten your life?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She gasps, as if the very thought is an affront to her. She does not make any sort of retort, however. After a long, awkward silence, she nods. &#x201C;Yes, that is what I wanted to hear,&#x201D; she says quietly. &#x201C;That is why I brought this matter to you, instead of arguing with Yifang. She would not have said it. I&#x2019;m a bit of a hypocrite, aren&#x2019;t I?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Everyone is. Are you feeling better now, Miss Song?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am, but this doesn&#x2019;t mean I can forgive my father&#x2019;s death. I know it sounds weird, but&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It still has nothing to do with Yifang or Cao&#x2019;er.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Her usual, bright smile returns. &#x201C;I know that. Don&#x2019;t worry, I never blamed them for my father&#x2019;s death. I just needed to let loose and rant for a bit, or else I would have gone mad.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And you picked <i>me </i>as the target?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who else? We are friends, aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m glad to hear that.&#x201D; Sighing, you pat her on the head. Lingshu unexpectedly lets out a little scream, her ears turning bright red as she leaps away from you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
It turned out that the aphrodisiac had been present in Lingshu&#x2019;s body too long; she lasted far longer than any other girl would have thanks to Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s efforts to stabilize her condition.  It had left her with heightened sensitivity; Cao&#x2019;er was looking for a way to cure it, and has prepared medication that would temporarily suppress the symptoms as long as it is taken constantly, but it would take a while before she could walk around freely without being brought low by the touch of others.<br>
<br>
That also meant that Song Lingshu had no other choice but to follow you to Chang&#x2019;an.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The road to Chang&#x2019;an is uneventful, and for once, you encounter no traffic mishaps. The calm journey allows you to further your studies.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You learn the animal-taming technique, Wudu Fushun, from Qilin. It might be good to have some animal servants in the future.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You learn a form of <i>neigong</i> from Qilin - while your streams are separated, you can allow your <i>qi </i>to take on a poisonous nature: Liedu Zhuanhua Skill (&#x70C8;&#x6BD2;&#x8F49;&#x5316;&#x529F;, Fierce Poison Transformation Skill), the Wudu Cult&apos;s basic <i>neigong </i>skill. It transforms the user&apos;s <i>qi </i>into one of a poisonous nature, allowing them to inflict crippling pain upon an opponent even when unarmed. It can also absorb all toxins, turning them into temporary fuel to strengthen the <i>neigong </i>of the practitioner, though at a cost of weakening the body in the long-term if overused.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You learn the Yuhe Finger from Cao&#x2019;er. Now that you can manipulate your <i>qi</i>, you will be able to use it to heal others.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You learn the Qingcheng Stab from Yifang, incorporating it into your self-taught technique with the Yuchang Sword. As her skill with it is perfect, watching her demonstration will likely gain you a perfect understanding of the technique.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You learn the Guihe Formation from Yifang, asking her to demonstrate the possible variations for all six members to you until you have memorized it all and are able to execute it by yourself.<br>
<br>
<b>F. </b>You learn the Qingzi Sword (&#x9752;&#x5B57;&#x528D;, Green Letter Sword) from Song Lingshu, a swift swordplay that is heavily focused on offense; it is said to be one of the quickest sword techniques in the <i>jianghu</i>. Designed to be used in conjunction with the Chengzi Step to form the Qingcheng Sect&apos;s famous Qingcheng Jianwu combination technique.<br>
<br>
<b>G. </b>You learn the Chengzi Step (&#x57CE;&#x5B57;&#x821E;, City Letter Step) from Song Lingshu, a defensive <i>qinggong</i> geared towards evading the attack patterns made by weapons, particularly those from the orthodox sects. Designed to be used in conjunction with the Qingzi Sword to form the Qingcheng Sect&apos;s famous Qingcheng Jianwu combination technique.<br>
<br>
<b>H. </b>You meditate on Wuxiang Qiankun, attempting to advance your knowledge of the technique to a higher level now that you have had practical experience with it in a real fight.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You try to teach your techniques to the girls.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&#x2019;t try to teach your techniques to the girls.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Upon your arrival in Chang&#x2019;an, the first thing you do is to gather information.<br>
<br>
Sneaking into the Imperial retreat, you learn that it has been granted to Xiahou Yu as a place of residence: he is not here at the moment, however, having taken Liu Chanfeng back to Yangzhou to visit her old friends at Yuhua Hall. The secret carvings you share with Shun have had a new, fresh line added: it tells you of the password you will need to gain access to the headquarters of the Imperial Constabulary, and reminds you not to anger them too much, should you feel a need to visit.<br>
<br>
Shun himself appears to be extremely busy at the moment, hammering out a newfound relationship with Tufan; Lhasa appears to be making some rather antagonistic overtures towards Tufan and the Tang. It would be best if you did not disturb him. It might be possible to get in contact with Gao Ying if you wanted to, though the very thought of asking him for help makes your stomach turn.<br>
<br>
It turns out that the Beggars&#x2019; Sect headquarters is not a place that is easy to find, but you manage to narrow it down to a certain street after asking around. None of the beggars in Chang&#x2019;an tell you of Qi Liuwu&#x2019;s whereabouts; whether they truly do not know, or are covering it up, you are uncertain. You do find out that the beggar you met in Tufan, Jiu Mou, is in town, and an old beggar hints that he is your best shot at finding Qi Liuwu.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian has returned to Huashan, while Zhang Manxing has gone to his family estate to rest from his exciting adventures in Tufan and Qingcheng.<br>
<br>
And above all this, news of the Three Manuals is spreading fast: everyone has their pet theories on where they are and who has them; some even claim Zhang Jue possesses the Xuanming Jiuyin Holy Art &#x2013; if he does, it is news to you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You pay a visit to the Imperial Constabulary; if Shun told you the password, it&#x2019;s clear that he&#x2019;s allowing you to take a look. You&#x2019;ll just have to remember to be polite.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You attempt to contact Gao Ying: he should know plenty about what is going on, thanks to his resources.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You get in touch with Jiu Mou. It is possible that he might know where Qi Liuwu is, if you get a chance to talk to him further. Besides, his presence in Tufan was suspicious.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You exit the city and visit Huashan: they are not likely to welcome you in, but that is what your sneaking skills are for. You would like to speak with Bai Jiutian further.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You pay your respects to the Zhang clan. You would have words with them on many, many matters. Perhaps they can come to a peaceful resolution...<br>
<br>

            <h3>二十二 · The Beggar&#039;s Tales</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Beggar&apos;s Tales</span></b><br>
<br>
The old beggar leads you to a ramshackle inn on the outskirts of the city. The only people you see lounging outside the establishment are a few rough-looking men, who give you the natural, challenging stare of those used to owning the place &#x2013; or at least, pretending to. You stare back with your single eye. Their gaze breaks first.<br>
<br>
As promised, you find Jiu Mou within the inn, at the furthest room in the back. He looks up as the old beggar brings you in. With a silent nod, he tosses a tael at the beggar. The dirty old man gives him a quick salute and hurries away. &#x201C;Wait,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;I already paid him a tael to find you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Jiu Mou makes a face of exasperation and groans, &#x201C;Liu, that old bastard! Oh well. In times like this I can&#x2019;t be picky. Chief You has eyes and ears almost everywhere in the union.&#x201D; He leans back, gesturing at the cheap food and wine laid out before you. &#x201C;Take a seat first, Xu Jing. I need to be going off again soon. There is &#x2013; unfortunately &#x2013; beggar business in the east.&#x201D; He gives you a pained look as he says it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I never knew beggars were so busy,&#x201D; you say, doing as he asks. &#x201C;The one I knew seemed to take life easily enough.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;New management, new rules,&#x201D; he sighs, pouring you a cup. Then, he gets up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Going so soon?&#x201D; you ask, puzzled. &#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t even started talking.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thankfully, it&#x2019;s not me you came to see,&#x201D; he grins. &#x201C;The old man will be here soon. I&#x2019;ll let him do the gabbing, heaven knows he loves it so much. I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll see you somewhere around the <i>jianghu</i> on our wanderings, someday.&#x201D; With a quick nod and the flash of a dirty smile, Jiu Mou exits the room, leaving you alone with the meal.<br>
<br>
Not knowing what else to do while you wait, you tuck in.<br>
<br>
A dozen minutes later, the door opens again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, kid. Long time no see.&#x201D; Qi Liuwu enters, having maneuvered the door open with his feet.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Qi.&#x201D; You incline your head, your greeting muffled by the food in your mouth.<br>
<br>
He sits down with no issues, his empty sleeves hanging loosely from his shoulders. He is a bit more aged than before, but the former beggar chief seems to be in better condition than Miecao. &#x201C;It was quite a surprise when I heard that you were looking for me. You must have a few questions to ask,&#x201D; he says, expertly lifting a gourd to his mouth with just his foot. It looks like even the lack of arms will not prevent him from his drink.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t come just for the questions, Master Qi,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I thought it would also be nice to sit and drink with you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, that would be nice,&#x201D; he laughs, dextrously manipulating a pair of chopsticks using his toes. Evidently he has no problem going about his daily life too, and you smile, impressed. Qi Liuwu catches your smile and shakes his head slightly. &#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t easy getting to this stage.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is a shame, though. What <i>did </i>happen on that day?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qi Liuwu&#x2019;s story matches that of Miecao&#x2019;s, and you gain no further insights. He seems rather certain, however, that the cliff was brought down by the energies of Wang Zhengchong and Ahura&#x2019;s battle. The conversation then turns to Jiu Mou, and the Tufan situation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I guess you could call him my prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;,&#x201D; says Qi Liuwu. &#x201C;When Chief You called for the snap election and took over, I did not contest on the terms that Jiu Mou would be acknowledged as the vice-chief. It is almost traditional for the vice-chief to be promoted to Chiefhood during the beggar elections, as it is a position that helps him garner support from the rank-and-file of the Beggar&#x2019;s Sect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Elections?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, yes. As beggars, we believe in giving every member an equal say in determining our leaders. Every few years, or when it is called for, we pick the members of the council as well as the chief,&#x201D; explains Qi Liuwu. &#x201C;When my nephew got into contact with me, I figured that I might as well give Jiu Mou some exposure to royalty too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What <i>were </i>the two of you doing in Tufan anyway? I was surprised to see a beggar there, contesting for a princess&#x2019;s hand,&#x201D; you say wryly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, that wasn&#x2019;t all that important, my nephew already had that filthy bastard Zhang Manxing around. We were there to investigate the Shaolin monk Xuxian.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Him? The one with the powerful inner strength?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, yes, of course you would have fought him,&#x201D; nods Qi Liuwu. &#x201C;He used to be a cook at the temple. One day he injured the Abbot and escaped from Shaolin. Apparently he learnt some of their techniques without permission.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t that a matter for Shaolin to handle, however?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not if one of those techniques was the Xiaoming Jiuyang Divine Skill,&#x201D; grins Qi Liuwu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, we believed that his drastic increase in inner strength was due to that particular manual. In the last struggle for the manuals, Shaolin Temple was rumoured to have kept a copy of the Xiaoming Jiuyang skill, though they have always denied it. They still do. Jiu Mou talked to Xuxian, however, and we can confirm they have at least a copy of the first part, which advances the <i>neigong </i>of the practitioner.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then, the copy of the Xiaoming Jiuyang Divine Skill that was stolen from the constables was&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, that also appeared to be the real deal, as far as I could tell,&#x201D; said Qi Liuwu, shaking his head. &#x201C;There have been quite a few copies of these manuals made over the years, some real, many fake. Most have been lost to the world thanks to the slaughter that usually accompanies them, but once in a while, they reappear&#x2026;&#x201D; He closes his eyes and sighs. &#x201C;Anyway, my nephew told me that his agents managed to track down and uncover that manual in an old temple just south of Chang&#x2019;an, hidden behind a Buddhist statue. It was sent to a safehouse for his constables to guard. He hoped to use secrecy as his primary defense, but apparently there is a leak somewhere, compromising his efforts. The constables on duty were no match for the assailants. I do not know much more than this; only the Imperial Constables have access to further information.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are they undertaking an investigation into the missing manual?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe. I don&#x2019;t know. They do have other things to do, though I would assume that the deaths of their brethren would have stoked a bit of anger in their hearts. Anyway, there is one other thing I have heard that you might be interested in.&#x201D; Qi Liuwu leans forward, grinning. &#x201C;The Ten Great Swords. You still carry the Yuchang Sword, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perfect. Apparently there is going to be a Conference of Swords on Taoying Island in a few months. All of the current holders of the Ten Great Swords have been invited.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t hear about that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, well, you were off wandering foreign lands, weren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; he laughs. &#x201C;I have it on good faith that there is a bait being dangled here&#x2026; the Xuanyuan Sword.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The most powerful of the Ten Great Swords&#x2026; you can&#x2019;t help but grin disbelievingly. &#x201C;Someone really knows how to bait swordsmen out.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Considering that the <i>jianghu</i> is in a mess over the Three Manuals already, I have good reason to believe that every current wielder will attend the conference&#x2026; including those who have kept themselves secret thus far. It is said to be a peaceful conference, a meeting where the Ten Great Swords meet up and elect a leader who will wield the Xuanyuan Sword.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It looks like whoever planned this has intentions of forming a power bloc of their own,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Given that some of those swords are in the hands of the Eight Sects, I can&#x2019;t see it going over well.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I don&#x2019;t doubt that the Eight Sects&#x2019; leaders like Nie Wuxing will be present. Wudang, too, even if they have lost their Qixing Longyuan Sword. They are going to want to see who shows up with it.&#x201D; Qi Liuwu nods confidently. &#x201C;It might prove to be an enlightening conference.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I doubt that it will be a peaceful one,&#x201D; you laugh, and the old beggar laughs together with you in agreement.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Before you end the day&#x2019;s meeting, you wonder if you should exchange tips with Qi Liuwu: he must not be able to use many martial arts now that he has no more hands. Perhaps you could teach him the Wuying Leipo Kick in return for verbal instruction in the Xianglong Palms.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Offer to spend a few days teaching Qi Liuwu at least half of the Wuying Leipo Kick technique in return for seven more moves of the Xianglong Palms.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&#x2019;t make the offer; you would rather spend the time investigating other places in Chang&#x2019;an and its vicinity. You might miss out on important information otherwise.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You find out that Gao Ying had left the city soon after your talk with Qi. It looks like you have lost your opportunity to meet with him for now.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You pay a visit to the Imperial Constabulary, now that you have heard from Qi Liuwu. There might be someone in the headquarters you can talk to.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You exit Chang&#x2019;an and sneak up Mount Hua. You are interested in talking to Bai Jiutian; antagonistic as he may be, perhaps he may be of aid to some of your goals here in Chang&#x2019;an.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You go to the Zhang clan manor to pay your respects&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You leave Chang&#x2019;an, heading towards Luoyang in the east. Shaolin Temple is there, and it is clear they have at least part of the Xiaoming Jiuyang manual.<br>
<br>

            <h3>二十三 · The Imperial Constabulary</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Imperial Constabulary</span></b><br>
<br>
When the Emperor Xuande decreed the establishment of the Eminently Judicious Imperial Tang Constabulary, he also had them set up quarters in Fuyuan Ward, located in the northeastern sector of Chang&#x2019;an and separate from the main administrative offices in the north central sector where the capital&#x2019;s own judiciary and constables were to be found. It was a demonstration of their independence from the royalty and bureaucracy. The offices of the Imperial Constables were not large; they occupied no more than a single building, and from what you have heard the staff do not number more than a hundred, administrative workers included.<br>
<br>
That was sufficient: the Imperial Constables did not need heavy manpower &#x2013; instead of being a police force concerned with keeping public order, they acted more as detectives and wandering agents of the law, given power to travel the land and investigate serious crimes regardless of rank or status. They were also tasked with special missions for the Emperor whenever men and women of their skills were required.<br>
<br>
They were known as masters of inquiry, experts of the natural sciences, and consummate investigators that would bring justice to every case.<br>
<br>
That did not stop you from sneaking in from the third floor window after it had turned out that the password Shun gave you was out of use since a few days ago, arousing the suspicion of the guards.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really,&#x201D; you mutter to yourself, &#x201C;He could have told me the expiry date.&#x201D; Since they would have recorded their investigations, it would be simpler for you to obtain those records rather than attempt to talk your way past some stubborn helmet-heads. Having climbed in easily &#x2013; evidently the constables need to improve their security &#x2013; you find yourself in an unlit large room, an ornate, round stone table placed in the center. You touch the table; the stone is highly polished and comfortably smooth to rub against. You are almost tempted to lie down on it and take a nap.<br>
<br>
The door to the room opens.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Intruder! State your name and purpose!&#x201D; shouts out a figure, dashing into the dark room.<br>
<br>
There is the glint of metal reflecting off the faint light coming in through the windows; as you focus your senses in response you can pick up the presence of not one, but at least six more people in the vicinity. The weapon flashes towards you threateningly. You retaliate in self-defense, striking at it with your scabbard, pinning it down on the table as your assailant gasps. With your other hand you lash out, grabbing the throat of one that had been planning to flank you, while you kick out towards your back almost simultaneously, pressing one more opponent against the wall. He lets out a muffled groan. &#x201C;Is this how the Imperial Constabulary greets a guest?&#x201D; you call out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem more like an intruder than a guest,&#x201D; replies a deep voice, calm despite the noisy struggles made in vain by the constables that you have subdued. &#x201C;Could someone please light up the room?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It takes a while for the lamps to be lit. When they are, you see that the man addressing you is a grizzled-looking middle-aged man who seems more at home in the battlefield than as a constable. &#x201C;Could you please let my men go now?&#x201D; You release the pressure on the three constables and they dart away from you, two of them coughing and choking. Then, you say, sincerely, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry for the intrusion.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
This earns you some glares, but their leader waves them down. &#x201C;I recognize those features from His Majesty&apos;s description. You must be Xu Jing. My name is Jiang Zheng, the chief of this constabulary. I heard from His Majesty that you might be dropping by sometime, but I did not expect such an entrance.&#x201D; His visage remains impassive as he stares at you; he is no lightweight in martial arts, it seems.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It seems that His Majesty&#x2019;s password was out of date,&#x201D; you say, shrugging.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, we had just changed it. I suppose a bit of miscommunication is unavoidable,&#x201D; he sighs. &#x201C;Come, sit. We were about to have a meeting on the progress of the investigation. I suppose your timing is strangely perfect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Which investigation would that be?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He raises an eyebrow. &#x201C;Would you be here for any other investigation, Xu Jing?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I guess not,&#x201D; you admit.<br>
<br>
You stand to the side as the Imperial Constables file in, each of them throwing suspicious glances at you bar one; Xiaofang, the cute servant girl who was with Zhang Manxing in Tufan. She averts her eyes, trying very hard not to look at you in whatever way possible. With a grin, you step around her as you try to succeed in getting her to meet your gaze, resulting in a strange dance that only ends when Jiang Zheng makes a loud, disapproving cough.<br>
<br>
You raise your hands and step back. That&#x2019;s right &#x2013; you&#x2019;d forgotten that Shun had told you not to anger them.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now, can we begin?&#x201D; grumbles Jiang. You look at each of the constables as their reports begin. The three you had subdued early on are talking animatedly &#x2013; two men, one woman, all three of them young, fair of face, and seemingly inexperienced, though to be selected to this position they must possess good investigative abilities despite their looks. There is Xiaofang, listening intently. Then there is a man older than Jiang Zheng, his hair white and his beard long who appears to be almost nodding off, and a very pretty woman in her late twenties who has a disinterested look on her face, focusing more on the papers in front of her than the words of her colleagues. The woman seems familiar to you somehow, but you cannot recall her face at the moment.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;To recapitulate,&#x201D; says one of the young men, &#x201C;Our colleagues were killed by a combination of the Qishang Fist (&#x4E03;&#x50B7;&#x62F3;, Seven Wounds Fist) and Wuqing Sword (&#x7121;&#x60C5;&#x528D;, Merciless Sword), techniques used by the Jinkong Sect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They are a small sect considered to be unorthodox, located in the mountains south of here,&#x201D; adds his friend. &#x201C;The Jinkong Sect are led by Master Li Yixian, but have never shown any tendency to get involved in pugilistic affairs prior to this event.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;However, they do have close relations with Du Yao of the nearby Youxia City, who was once the <i>shidi </i>of Li Yixian before he entered service with the court. They maintained that relationship even after he left the sect,&#x201D; says the girl. &#x201C;Still, I think it is strange that they would leave such an obvious trail leading back to them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They might not care if they get the manual, thinking that it would make their sect invincible,&#x201D; comments Jiang Zheng. &#x201C;Regardless, speaking with Du Yao would be our best bet. I will handle this meeting personally... we have crossed paths a few times before.&#x201D; Looking at one of the young men and the girl, he says, &#x201C;Mi Shang, Zhu Xiaoling, you will look after the headquarters while I am not here.&#x201D; They nod and salute. Then, Jiang turns to the old man, &#x201C;Master Shang, please investigate Du Yao&#x2019;s contacts in the capital.&#x201D; The sleepy old man lets out a grunt of affirmation. &#x201C;Xiaofang, you will be coming with me, but I will need you to undertake a female disguise again.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xiaofang is clearly unhappy, but gives a nod anyway. &#x201C;Yes, Chief Jiang.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<i>Ah, so Xiaofang is an eunuch</i>, you think to yourself. A dangerously cute one.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fu Xia, Lady Suien, you will also travel with me to Youxia City. I will need your expertise there,&#x201D; continues Jiang. The other young man gives an enthusiastic response, while the woman just frowns and inclines her head. Her identity strikes you suddenly &#x2013; despite her age, she is one of Shun&#x2019;s nieces, a daughter of his eldest brother. A princess by birth, she had renounced her royalty from an early age, opting to spend her life in scholarly studies rather than being a pawn for marriage.<br>
<br>
Finally, Jiang Zheng turns to you. &#x201C;Well now, Xu Jing. What do you think? I know His Majesty was keen to get you involved in the early days of this case, when we still had the manual in our possession. Unfortunately he could not find you in time, but I think his judgment is still sound even at this stage of the investigation &#x2013; we&#x2026; well, I would be at more ease knowing that a fighter of your caliber will be assisting us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about your subordinates? I fear we got off on the wrong note,&#x201D; you say, attempting to put an apologetic tone in your voice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not worry,&#x201D; he scowls, seemingly offended by your statement. &#x201C;We are professionals, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And I will be taking orders from you while on this mission?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Huh, a free-spirited stallion, like the Emperor said,&#x201D; he mutters, before giving you his answer. &#x201C;Think of it as advice. You are free to ignore my words&#x2026; I do not think I would be able to stop you by force. But I hope you consider this matter serious enough to heed my counsel and perform your duties where necessary. This is not a military operation, but a civil investigation. I will not demand complete obedience.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You consider his words. &#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will go to Youxia City with Jiang Zheng, along with your companions. It is a few days south of here, in the mountains, and also a short distance away from Wudang to the east. The lead that the constables have seem to be solid: if they come across any hostiles in their search, you would like to be there to help them out.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will not go to Youxia City. You will head east to Luoyang and Shaolin, pursuing the lead that you have obtained from Qi Liuwu. Let the constables search for it by themselves; if they fail or die, perhaps you can backtrack later to see what they have managed to find, and pick up the investigation yourself from there.<br>

            <h3>二十四 · Xinchun Restaurant, Youxia City</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Xinchun Restaurant, Youxia City</span></b><br>
<br>
Although Youxia City is not governed by any official of the government, it pays its tribute to the Imperial Court; after the brief war between the Tang army and the Bandit Kingdom, the much diminished bandits agreed to a treaty that reduced their territory and established the independent status of Youxia City &#x2013; it would no longer be under the thumb of Pang Hu.<br>
<br>
The lord of the city is Du Yao, who was once a minor bureaucrat in Chang&#x2019;an. Under his rule Youxia City has become known for its lucrative black market. If there is any city in the Central Plains that can be called a nest of miscreants and thieves, this is it. However, Youxia City is also one of the freest cities; there is little in the way of taxes and regulations. It now runs a thriving business off of the bandits, the nearby Tang garrison, as well as a multitude of visitors whose strange and perhaps disreputable tastes are catered to.<br>
<br>
You catch your first sight of the city as you come down the mountain pass. Unlike the stone walls surrounding the more respectable cities, Youxia City is surrounded by wooden ramparts. The buildings in and around the city are constructed haphazardly, with no thought given as to planning and layout; more than anything, it seems like a collection of buildings that have sprouted all over the place like mushrooms. The path to the city is well-lit with lanterns, and the city itself is full of life. You can feel the activity even though you have not yet stepped past its gates.<br>
<br>
Your group arrives separately from Jiang Zheng&#x2019;s constables; they had to strap the paralyzed Fu Xia to a horse for a good part of the journey after he attempted to flirt with Cao&#x2019;er and Yifang, and from that moment onwards Jiang had ordered the two groups to move separately until further notice.<br>
<br>
The guards at the gate do not stop you, nor they do even pretend to notice you; they seem more preoccupied with their game of dice than anything else. As you pass under the rickety of arch, Song Lingshu lets out a murmur of astonishment. Narrow streets and crowded buildings stretch out before you, packed with all manner of activity both legal and illegal.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;First time travelling the <i>jianghu</i>?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
She shakes her head. &#x201C;No, but I&#x2019;ve always journeyed with either my father or Mao Sanjiao. They&#x2019;ve never brought me to these places.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do not like it here,&#x201D; says Yifang, lowering her head. &#x201C;It is sinful.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;Of course it is. There is no place without sin in the world, sister.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to worry, Yifang,&#x201D; says Lingshu happily. &#x201C;Just like there is no shadow without light, the darker the evil, the more brightly our justice shines! We should be able to do much good here.&#x201D; Apparently Lingshu and Yifang had busied themselves righting wrongs and capturing criminals in Chang&#x2019;an while you were occupied with other matters, earning a small reputation for themselves as they assisted the city&#x2019;s constables in their duties.<br>
<br>
You wonder amusedly how they will find Youxia City.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We are supposed to meet up with Chief Jiang at Xinchun Restaurant, aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201D; asks Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Should we ask someone for the way?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need. I know how to get there. It&#x2019;s the most famous restaurant in the northern region, beating out even Chang&#x2019;an&#x2019;s famed Fuman Restaurant. Their roasted duck is to <i>die</i> for,&#x201D; she says excitedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem really knowledgeable about food for someone who can&#x2019;t cook,&#x201D; you remark.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh? You seemed eager enough to tuck in the last time I made something for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Your face twists into a grimace as the memory comes back to you, causing Qilin to giggle. To be fair, you had no choice in the matter whatsoever, at the time&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Qilin leads the way through the narrow streets, and you remind Cao&#x2019;er and the others to follow closely. You would not want any of them getting lost. Cao&#x2019;er seems to take it quite literally, however; she clings on to you, with Yifang clinging to her, and Song Lingshu taking her friend&#x2019;s hand at the end of the line &#x2013; it is enough to attract the attentions of the passersby as you walk down the street like a mother duck leading her ducklings.<br>
<br>
You reach Xinchun Restaurant without any mishaps on the way. It is a large, wooden structure three-storeys high and full of raucous revelry. Entering the building, you see that it is packed &#x2013; there must be hundreds of customers here. Most of them look like they can hold their own in a fight; there are soldiers, thugs, bandits and pugilists both men and women, and even a few drunken monks lounging about. The waiters are busy scurrying about the place, serving the dishes as fast as they can.<br>
<br>
Looking around, you spot Jiang Zheng and his constables at a table, food already on the table. Xiaofang and Fu Xia are talking animatedly, the former having put on a very feminine disguise and the latter now cured of his paralysis. Lady Suien has her nose in her books rather than the food in front of her. Chief Jiang is the only person actually eating, though he does so quietly and slowly, taking his time.<br>
<br>
Approaching them, you ask, &#x201C;I am sorry, but this place appears to be rather full. Could we share this table with you?&#x201D; Jiang Zheng looks up at you and nods stoicly. As your group takes their seats, Fu Xia moves away nervously when he sees Cao&#x2019;er. She ignores him, instead taking out her own books and burying herself in them, just like Lady Suien opposite her. The waiter comes over; Qilin takes care of the ordering before you can say anything, rattling off a list of delicacies. The waiter takes her order readily before running off.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I hope you can pay for that,&#x201D; you whisper.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But <i>you&#x2019;re</i> the head of the household, darling!&#x201D; she replies, feigning a look of shock before grinning. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, the government will pick up the tab, won&#x2019;t they?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Jiang Zheng scowls, but nods. &#x201C;Necessary expenses,&#x201D; he grunts.<br>
<br>
Qilin flashes you a look of triumph.<br>
<br>
As you wait for the food to come, you begin talking to the chief constable. &#x201C;What are we doing here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The first rule of any investigation is to keep yourself fed. Can&#x2019;t run one on an empty stomach,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Besides, we all need some rest after the journey. After this, I&#x2019;ll pay Du Yao a visit. I&#x2019;m sure he already knows I am here, so it is better to meet him sooner rather than later.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you need me to do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just be prepared for anything. You can come along with me if you wish. If I am unable to find out anything from Du Yao, we will have to keep our ears open in this city. Leads will surface sooner or later&#x2026; in fact, look over there.&#x201D; He gives a surreptitious jab with his thumb that only you can see. You slowly shift your gaze slightly so that you see who he is pointing at: a man with untied long hair, sitting together with three others at a small table. They appear to be wearing uniform colours, black and red. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the uniform of the Jinkong Sect,&#x201D; explains Jiang Zheng. &#x201C;The man with the long hair is one of their senior disciples, Xi Mukang.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It wouldn&#x2019;t be surprising to see them here, since their sect is nearby, right?&#x201D; you offer.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, it wouldn&#x2019;t. They could be here for entirely unrelated reasons. But it would be a good idea to keep an eye on him anyway. We also-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Come on, ladies, hang out with us instead! These men are more interested in talking to each other than plucking the beautiful flowers in their midst!&#x201D; Jiang is interrupted vulgarly by a red-faced large man leaning over your table. His sleeves are ripped off &#x2013; on purpose, it seems &#x2013; baring his muscular arms. The interloper drapes one such arm over Song Lingshu, grinning. Her nose wrinkles; he probably stinks of alcohol.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, how about it?&#x201D; he grins goofily.<br>
<br>
Before you can do anything, Lingshu drives an elbow into the man&#x2019;s gut, sending him stumbling away in pain. There is a smile on her face. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you know it is impolite to lay your hands on a lady? Really, you should behave yourself,&#x201D; she calls out, as the man falls to his knees, hunched over.<br>
<br>
A split second later, chaos sweeps the restaurant; it looks like the fallen man was part of a rather larger group. They rush at her, but with an expert twist of her wrist she brings one man down and kicks him right in the face. Yifang immediately leaps to her aid, nervously guarding Lingshu&#x2019;s back as she takes down a grown man with a chop to the neck.<br>
<br>
You try to stand up to stop the fight, but Jiang shakes his head, his face now set into a frown that seems to be on his face more often than not ever since the two of you became acquainted. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. It is not that unusual in Youxia City for a fight to break out, and it&#x2019;ll be a good distraction while I leave. In fact&#x2026; I think I should leave to meet Du Yao now. Before anything else happens.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the small brawl that Lingshu and Yifang have gotten themselves in has widened in scope; some of Lingshu&#x2019;s careless attacks have sent men flying into other tables, angering even more of the patrons.<br>
<br>
One of them attempts to grab Cao&#x2019;er, charging at her. Annoyance smouldering in her eyes, she flicks her fingers, sending a chopstick shooting right into his eye. He falls, rolling on the floor in agony.<br>
<br>
Yet another one goes after Lady Suien. Without so much as looking away from her books even once, she draws a strange, unwieldy contraption from her robes and points it at his legs. There is a bang and a puff of smoke, and her assailant hops backwards as he clutches his bleeding thigh. He crashes into the drunken monks&#x2019; table, spilling their food all over the floor. The shaved ones spring to their feet, shouting angrily both at him and at your group. Fu Xia stands up and tries to talk with them, but instead becomes entangled in a fight with the monks.<br>
<br>
Xiaofang, on the other hand, is just sitting and staring at the chaotic mess all around her.<br>
<br>
The Jinkong Sect members are looking around angrily, as if they too have been infected by the mood and want to participate in the brawl, but Xi Mukang is still sipping his wine calmly. That only lasts until a flying man knocks the cup from his hand. They, too, join the fight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Try this, it&#x2019;s good!&#x201D; says Qilin as she dangles some nice-looking duck meat from her chopsticks. She seems entirely unconcerned at the brawl going on around her that now threatens to engulf all three floors of the restaurant.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You leave the restaurant to meet Du Yao, the most influential man in the city.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You do so together with Jiang Zheng. It would be a good opportunity to introduce yourself to the lord of the city formally, and you would be able to pick up more of the investigation directly that way. Besides, he probably already knows of your arrival in the city anyway - you should pay your respects honestly.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You arrive separately from Jiang Zheng, introducing yourself as if you had no relation to him. Perhaps Du Yao will say different things to different people. This could yield valuable information that Jiang Zheng would not be able to obtain; your reputation as the Southern Maniac&apos;s apprentice could be advantageous here.<br>
<br>
<b>3. </b>You sneak after Jiang Zheng, shadowing him into the estate. Just in case &#x2013; it could be more interesting if no one knew you were there. Perhaps you might be able to uncover more secrets as you snoop about Du Yao&apos;s residence and eavesdrop wherever you can.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You stay in the restaurant so that you can keep an eye on the Jinkong Sect members.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You will make the girls behave and sit down, and then you will crush this entire restaurant by yourself. There are perhaps two, three hundred people here at least. No problem. You&#x2019;ll just have to beat them down until they give up, and you don&#x2019;t think it will take long. Still, it is a pity you did not learn the Lion&apos;s Roar... it would have been perfect here.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You join the girls in the brawl and lend them a hand. You will fight together with them until your opponents surrender or the restaurant is destroyed, whichever comes first. It might not be too wise to leave everything up to the hot-headed Lingshu. Though you probably don&apos;t have the right to criticize her on that aspect.<br>
<br>
<b>3. </b>You sit back and enjoy the meal with Qilin. The rest of the girls can handle the fight; it&#x2019;ll be good practice for them. Besides, Qilin is really insisting that the duck is <i>very </i>good, and you&#x2019;re more interested in whether it lives up to the hype. Anyone that interrupts you does so at their own peril.<br>

            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">A Changing City</span></b><br>
<br>
A powerful kick smashes the table before you can have a taste of the duck, sending the dishes clattering to the floor. &#x201C;Listen to me when I&#x2019;m talking to you, son!&#x201D; shouts the perpetrator, a large, brawny mountain with a wide, flat mouth and a craggy face only a mother could love. &#x201C;How&#x2019;re you going to compensate for your girls ruining our meal?&#x201D; The brawl is still continuing all around you, and your food is already lost. Qilin seems particularly distraught at the tragic, untimely loss of the duck. You turn to the nervous waiter, still operating professionally in such a situation, and try to make an order for another duck.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, sir, we are all out of duck for today,&#x201D; he apologizes. &#x201C;We do have other specialties you can try.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That will have to do,&#x201D; you sigh. Qilin is actually genuinely sulking &#x2013; a rare display from her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Would you like to move to another table?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, just bring it here. I&#x2019;ll find another table, there&#x2019;s no need to trouble yourself.&#x201D; You smile, and wave the waiter away.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, I&#x2019;m talking to you, son!&#x201D; The man attacks you, enraged by your refusal to acknowledge his existence. Still seated, you sway to the sides, avoiding his strikes. You raise your foot and block an incoming kick, and with a quick lash of your palm you send him staggering back. He grins, though you can see that his confidence is shaken just a slightly. The man towers over your bench, breathing heavily. &#x201C;Not bad, son, not bad. But do you know who I am? I am Dong Dazhui, but people call me Big Mouth Dong! I am big around here! You&#x2019;ll regret ignoring me!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His spittle hits your face. You quietly wipe it off.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A pleasure to meet you, Big Mouth Dong. I am Xu Jing, but people call me Man Tiger Pig. I am new around here, so forgive my upcoming rudeness,&#x201D; you say, just quietly enough that only he can hear it. He tries to work his mind around that name; it is apparently familiar to him. You give him a winning smile. His face pales when he realizes your identity, but it is too late. Before he can react, you grab him by the ears and pull. He is forced down to his knees, yelling in pain. You seal his pressure points to immobilize him and methodically rearrange the man&#x2019;s posture.<br>
<br>
One by one, eyes are drawn to your handiwork. Nervous murmurs begin to travel around the restaurant and soon the brawl grinds down to an end as the participants begin leaving in a hurry.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yeah, that&#x2019;s it! My name is Song Lingshu of Qingcheng! Remember it, evil-doers!&#x201D; shouts Lingshu happily as she brushes her disheveled hair back. You had heard her say that she used to get into brawls with the male disciples back when she was a child, but you did not expect her to be so fond of one.<br>
<br>
She turns around, her eyes widen, and she asks, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You cheerfully pat the wide back of the immobilized Big Mouth Dong, where the fresh dishes had been served. &#x201C;Just a table. Come on, get something to eat.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, my fellow tiger friend! I knew it was you!&#x201D; A loud voice booms across the restaurant; you know who it is without even needing to look. Pang Xiaohu walks over with a jovial chortle, his ever-present axes by his side and followed by a dozen menacing guards. You gesture at the rest of your companions, telling them that you will handle this. It would be good to get through the night without another fight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see you&#x2019;ve replaced the one that Prince Tenzin took,&#x201D; you say, raising your hand in brief greeting.<br>
<br>
He laughs. &#x201C;I need at least two to sleep at night!&#x201D; Looking around at the wreckage around him, he continues, &#x201C;I arrived a bit too late to partake in the fun, but I suppose we&#x2019;ll have to go another round the next time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;B-boss&#x2026;&#x201D; croaks the table. Pang squats down and squints. &#x201C;Eh? That you, Little Dong? Xu Jing, what did you do to my Little Dong here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He broke my table,&#x201D; you respond calmly. &#x201C;In his shame, he volunteered his aid.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Huh.&#x201D; Shrugging his broad shoulders, he says, &#x201C;I suppose that&#x2019;s what he does, then. Don&#x2019;t kill him, though. I&#x2019;d appreciate that. I need to take care of my men, and if you killed him I&apos;d have to kill you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You assure the Little Tiger that you have no intention of killing his men at this moment, and he gives you a satisfied nod.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Great, thanks. Oh, I see you&#x2019;ve added to your harem too, pal.&#x201D; Pang winks lewdly before laughing out loud. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t mean anything by it,&#x201D; he clarifies shortly after, &#x201C;Real men do not even consider touching the wives of their friends. Your wives are like sisters to me!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You chuckle. &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t aware we were friends, Pang Xiaohu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, you fought me, I fought you, we both walked away happy, that&#x2019;s as much friendship as there can be in this world!&#x201D; he proclaims.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course, I&#x2019;m sure that won&#x2019;t stop you from trying to kill me the next time we fight?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course! Here&#x2019;s a man that knows the ways of the world!&#x201D; grins Pang Xiaohu fiercely. &#x201C;Well, I shall not bother you further, Man Tiger Pig. I have my men to entertain on the third floor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With that, the Bandit Prince departs, leaving you to enjoy your duck-less dinner in peace.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You had retired to a nearby inn after dinner. Surprisingly, Pang Xiaohu had paid for the meal, insisting that it was on him. No one seemed inclined to dispute his generous gesture, not after they saw the numbers scratched out at the end of the list. Heading upstairs to your rooms, you attempt to strike up a conversation with Lady Suien. You have memories of her babysitting both you and Shun many years ago: though none of them are particularly good ones, and some ended up being rather horrible for you &#x2013; but not Shun, due to his status as the Crown Prince &#x2013; you think it would be nice to catch up. Besides, you are rather interested in that contraption she had.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Lady Suien-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
She turns around quickly. &#x201C;I have nothing to say to you, Xu Jing. Do not bother me more than is necessary,&#x201D; says the lady in a cool, measured manner.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t said anything,&#x201D; you say, a bit defensively.<br>
<br>
Lady Suien gives you one of the best dismissive glares you have ever received and walks off down the corridor before you can talk about anything else.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A bit of an ice queen, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201D; says Fu Xia, coming up behind you. The angry, drunken, and very persistent monks had chased him out of the restaurant during the brawl, but he seems to have managed to escape from their clutches relatively unscathed, save for some minor injuries. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t take it personally, she&#x2019;s like that with everyone. A bit of a kook, but she&#x2019;s brilliant. Man, those monks&#x2026; if I weren&#x2019;t still working off that paralysis I would have taught them a lesson!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Though there is a hint of nervousness in his voice &#x2013; after all, you did choke him in your first meeting &#x2013; the young constable seems to be pleased to have something to talk to you about. He appears to be the naturally gregarious sort, despite the rough start the both of you have gotten off to. &#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing her work. Is Chief Jiang back yet?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
Fu Xia shakes his head. &#x201C;The chief does his own thing. He is acquainted with Du Yao too, they go back some way. I wouldn&#x2019;t worry about him here. Speaking of which, Xiaofang isn&#x2019;t here too. I wonder where he&#x2019;s gone&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You realize that you had not seen Xiaofang soon after the brawl started too &#x2013; she... no, he was gone by the time Pang Xiaohu arrived. You wonder if he was lost in the fight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; says Fu. &#x201C;He tends to operate on his own&#x2026; he&#x2019;s something like a loan from the eunuch department.&#x201D; Something about the look in his eyes tells you that he is not too fond of Xiaofang despite the friendly way they were talking to each other before dinner. Fu Xia stretches his arms, letting out a wide yawn. &#x201C;Well! It&#x2019;s going to be a long day ahead once Chief Jiang gets back. I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It seems that there is nothing more for you to do except to return to your room and await Jiang Zheng&#x2019;s report on his meeting with Du Yao.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The chief constable never returns to the inn.<br>
<br>
The first news you receive in the morning is that of Fu Xia telling you that Chief Jiang had been injured and captured by Du Yao&#x2019;s men.<br>
<br>
He had been found with a corpse: Du Yao&#x2019;s.<br>
<br>
Jiang Zheng had been arrested by what passes for law in Youxia City and charged with the murder of the city&#x2019;s leader. As the news spreads, you wonder why they did not kill him on the spot, as you expected them to do.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Chief Jiang is an Imperial Constable after all. We are representatives of the Emperor himself, with official ranks and everything,&#x201D; explains Fu Xia.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see.&#x201D; You get it. If that is the case, considering Youxia City&#x2019;s current status as a self-governing city paying tribute to the Tang Emperor, they could not simply execute an official of the Tang court without first satisfying all avenues of inquiry. That would be giving an excuse for the Tang soldiers stationed nearby to march in and impose their own rule on the place. It looks like Du Yao&#x2019;s lieutenants were savvy enough to realize this.<br>
<br>
In fact, the news has already spread enough that the commander of the garrison is said to have mobilized three thousand of his men to march towards Youxia, especially since it has become known that the Little Tiger of the Bandit Kingdom just led a few hundred men into the city the night before.<br>
<br>
The remnants of Du Yao&#x2019;s operation, more concerned with keeping both sides in a non-violent truce &#x2013; or at least, non-violent by the standards of Youxia City &#x2013; would not act rashly. Du Yao&#x2019;s death has left a vacuum at the top, and any hasty action on their part now might leave them without a city to govern when the dust settles. It would be in their best interests to conduct a fair trial, one that satisfies both the Tang and the Bandit Kingdom. The Bandit King, Pang Hu, will likely be hoping for Chief Jiang to be found guilty, as that strikes a blow to the image of the Tang, but you think even he will not make any impulsive moves before a verdict is reached.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are empowered by my uncle to conduct an independent investigation even in tributaries or foreign lands as long as Tang citizens are involved. This case applies,&#x201D; says Lady Suien. It feels rather weird to see an older woman call Shun uncle, but somehow you feel that now is not the time to bring up her age.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xiaofang is still missing,&#x201D; Fu Xia points out. The lady-like eunuch had not returned since last night. Lady Suien nods. &#x201C;We must find him too. This is strange.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You wonder what you should do next. Your first suspicion would fall on the Jinkong Sect members, but the last you saw of them, they had been defeated soundly by Lingshu in the restaurant. Their relation to the case is still uncertain.<br>
<br>
Or perhaps you should just pack up and leave Youxia City before trouble breaks out. After all, you have no obligations to the Imperial Constables.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You stay in Youxia City to assist the remaining constables in the investigation. You feel that this matter is not as simple as it seems, and that Du Yao&#x2019;s death has something to do with the investigation into the missing Xiaoming Jiuyang Divine Skill manual.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You leave Youxia City. You do not want to tarry long in this place; let the constables take care of their own.<br>
<b>1. </b>You attempt to find the location of the Jinkong Sect. You will investigate the Sect directly and try to find out what they know.<br>
<b>2. </b>You travel towards Wudang Mountain. You have spent enough time in this region &#x2013; perhaps Wudang has some fresh leads for you.<br>
<b>3. </b>You make the trip to Luoyang; Shaolin Temple is close by, and you already know they have a partial copy of the Jiuyang manual.<br>

            <h3>二十六 · Youxia City Investigations</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					Eh, if it&apos;s going to be that unanimous...<br>
<br>
Here, have a quick, short update.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Youxia City Investigations</span></b><br>
<br>
In the end, it appears that your nose could not refrain from poking itself into the case.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It appears that you are a genuine constable,&#x201D; says the man with the well-trimmed beard. He tosses the emblem back at Fu Xia, who almost fumbles it. &#x201C;Very well,&#x201D; he continues, &#x201C;we will give our cooperation. Still, I cannot help but wonder&#x2026; what is that man doing here? I did not know that the Imperial Constabulary had any connections with the infamous Man Tiger Pig.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give him a grin, though it is not reciprocated.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Will it be a problem, Zheng Fan?&#x201D; asks Lady Suien.<br>
<br>
Zheng&#x2019;s head turns slowly from side to side. &#x201C;No, not at all. I was just curious. On behalf of Youxia City, as custodians of Master Du&#x2019;s legacy, we hereby extend to you all rights necessary to investigate the incident of his murder. Within reason, of course.&#x201D; He stands up, open palm over closed fist in the traditional salute before giving a slight bow. His fellow lieutenants nod and follow suit, each as well-dressed as he is.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, that went better than expected!&#x201D; says Fu Xia relievedly when the three of you are safely back at the inn. Qilin and the girls are waiting for you inside one of the rooms. As you explain the situation to them, Lady Suien rolls out a large piece of paper over the table. &#x201C;Less idle talk, more work. Get started.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a sigh, Fu Xia prepares ink and a brush, and begins drawing and writing. &#x201C;Alright, Xu Jing, you are new to this, so listen closely,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;We need to establish procedures. Things to examine. Places to investigate. People to question. So&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It looks like he has divided up the investigation into several tasks:<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Inspection of Du Yao&#x2019;s corpse, currently on ice inside his mansion.</li>
<li>Questioning of Du Yao&#x2019;s daughter, who was the first to find Jiang Zheng and her father.</li>
<li>Questioning of the mansion&#x2019;s help &#x2013; the common servants.</li>
<li>Questioning of Du Yao&#x2019;s staff &#x2013; his lieutenants, guards, and other people related to his business activities.</li>
<li>Investigation of the mansion and its grounds for any clues.</li>
<li>General investigation of the city for any rumours and leads that can be linked back to the death.</li>
<li>Search for Xiaofang, the eunuch constable who is still missing.</li>
</ol><br>
Fu Xia finishes the last line with a flourish. &#x201C;I think this is enough for today,&#x201D; he says.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm, you forgot something,&#x201D; you point out.<br>
<br>
He looks puzzled, but Lady Suien nods and chastises him firmly. &#x201C;We need to question Chief Jiang too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;B-but&#x2026; it&#x2019;s the chief. There&apos;s no need to-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Rule nothing out.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Grumbling, Fu Xia adds another task to the list: the questioning of Chief Constable Jiang Zheng.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The constables have requested your aid in the investigation. There are, in total, seven of you:<br>
<br>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">A. Xu Jing<br>
B. Chi Qilin<br>
C. Cao&apos;er<br>
D. Yifang<br>
E. Song Lingshu<br>
F. Lady Suien<br>
G. Fu Xia&#x200B;</div><br>
There are eight tasks to carry out today:<br>
<br>
<div style="padding-left: 30px">1. Inspection of Du Yao&#x2019;s corpse, currently on ice inside his mansion.<br>
2. Questioning of Du Yao&#x2019;s daughter, who was the first to find Jiang Zheng and her father.<br>
3. Questioning of the mansion&#x2019;s help &#x2013; the common servants.<br>
4. Questioning of Du Yao&#x2019;s staff &#x2013; his lieutenants, guards, and other people related to his business activities.<br>
5. Investigation of the mansion and its grounds for any clues.<br>
6. General investigation of the city for any rumours and leads that can be linked back to the death.<br>
7. Search for Xiaofang, the eunuch constable who is still missing.<br>
8. Questioning of Jiang Zheng, the chief constable who is being held in prison.&#x200B;</div><br>
Lady Suien tells you that you should know your companions&apos; abilities better than she does, and asks you to decide the assignments. On her part, she says that she is not too fond of talking to people. She also tells you that Fu Xia is more proficient at talking to people in the pugilistic community.<br>
<br>
Given the timeframe and workload, it would be possible to assign one person to two tasks, and it is possible that you might achieve better results by having more than one person working on the same assignment, though in some cases it might also be beneficial to have only one person involved.<br>
<br>
You wonder how you should divide up the tasks...<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Make votes for each category: A, B, C, etc.<br>
<br>
A1,2 would mean character A is assigned to tasks one and two.<br>
<br>
You are limited to selecting a maximum two tasks per character. You can opt to not vote for any tasks for the character, in which case they&apos;ll do their own thing.<br>
<br>
All counts will be tallied and the two highest-scoring tasks for each character will be selected. If any single task has an overwhelming majority of votes (80% of the total count) for any particular character, compared to the other options, it will be selected as the <span style="text-decoration: underline">only</span> task that character undertakes.<br>
<br>
There will be no conditional votes for this update.<br>
<br>
***<br>

            <h3>二十七 · Duck Testimony</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Duck Testimony</span></b><br>
<br>
Xinchun Restaurant is as noisy as usual, the damages of last night&#x2019;s brawl already repaired; though there was not really much to repair in the first place, considering the condition of the furniture &#x2013; it looked like they had been pieced and hammered back together more times than you would care to count. Though you thought that the constables would have preferred a quieter place to discuss their findings, Fu Xia had claimed that public places attracted less attention, and that it was constable tradition to deliberate the case over a good meal. Lady Suien had not raised any objections, and so you followed their lead back to the restaurant.<br>
<br>
As usual, Qilin made a quick order for duck.<br>
<br>
While waiting for the food to arrive, everyone began sharing what they have found, working their way down the list of tasks in a systematic manner.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er and Lady Suien sit in silence for many minutes before the latter finally offers any words. &#x201C;We investigated the body,&#x201D; she says quietly. &#x201C;There were just a few wounds, but I think the physician would be better suited to talking about that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah&#x2026; yes&#x2026;&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er looks at you. &#x201C;Jing, listen carefully&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about the rest of us?&#x201D; jokes Fu Xia. He is swiftly cowed into silence by a combined glare from Cao&#x2019;er and Lady Suien.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er begins her report, detailing the injuries inflicted upon Du Yao by his murderer.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;two small contusions along the right arm.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Probably self-defense from blocking an attack. Appears to have been a kick,&#x201D; comments Lady Suien.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;a single stab wound just below the left collarbone. Made by a flat blade of twelve inches in length and two inches in width... but not the killing blow.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It matches that of the standard short sword issued to the constables.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;three very small puncture marks in the side of the neck&#x2026; similar to a needle wound&#x2026;&#x201D; continues Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would definitely have missed that,&#x201D; Lady Suien frowns.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He could have been undergoing acupuncture,&#x201D; offers Fu Xia excitedly. &#x201C;Perhaps he was stressed out over something important!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He is ignored by the two ladies, leaving him looking like a fool. &#x201C;I cannot be sure right now, but&#x2026; poison is my guess&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Through the needles?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Possibly,&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;&#x2026; from the angle and depth of penetration, they were thrown&#x2026; and were not aimed for any pressure points&#x2026; the time of death was in the middle of the <i>hai</i> hour, and all the injuries were made around the same time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; you nod. &#x201C;If it were not poisoned, it would be rather useless as a weapon.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Without any other lethal injuries on his body, I think poison is the best explanation we have,&#x201D; concludes Lady Suien.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Miss Song made a new friend quickly,&#x201D; grins Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You exaggerate!&#x201D; says Lingshu, smiling, &#x201C;Miss Du was easy to talk to. She was still distraught over her father&#x2019;s death, but I managed to cheer her up.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We asked her to write down her testimony,&#x201D; Qilin adds, handing over a few sheets of paper to you. &#x201C;I thought it would be wiser this way, just in case she forgets something.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Taking the paper, you scan your eye past the lines of neat, feminine writing. It is marked with the Du family seal, establishing its authenticity. You begin to read the testimony of Du&#x2019;s daughter.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I had brought tea over to my father&#x2019;s study in the inner yard, near the end of the <i>xu </i>hour. At that time, he was conversing with a man called Jiang Zheng. I did not plan to eavesdrop, but I overheard them discussing the Jinkong Sect and some manual. They paused their discussion when I knocked. When I entered the room, everything was normal. I paid my greetings and left. Some time after the middle of the <i>hai </i>hour, I returned to the study to remind my father to rest since he had not yet retired to his chambers. I found Jiang Zheng holding a bloody sword, standing over my father&#x2019;s corpse. There was no one else in the room. When I screamed, the guards came to help, and arrested the murderer. Thus are the facts as I have seen them, with the heavens as my witness.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Does she know anything of her father&#x2019;s business dealings, or who could have wanted him dead?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
Qilin shakes her head. &#x201C;She is not too involved with his work. She did say, however, that whoever killed Du Yao did not have the city&#x2019;s best interests at heart, and I would concur. He was protected from assassination mainly by his ability to keep the city thriving, not by the mediocre guards around his house.&#x201D;<br>
<br>

<br>
&#x201C;The servants did not see anything out of the extraordinary,&#x201D; says Lingshu and Yifang. &#x201C;They work mainly in the inner yard, where Du Yao&#x2019;s henchmen are not allowed, and did not spot any suspicious people lurking around besides Jiang Zheng.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure?&#x201D; asks Fu Xia, who had been questioning the servants with them. The two girls nod, and he grins. &#x201C;Aha! Now is the time for me to show my prowess! Listen and be amazed; I was told by one of the servants that there was a disciple of the Jinkong Sect at the mansion during the <i>hai </i>hour. From her description, he looked like that guy&#x2026; uh&#x2026; at the restaurant. Xi&#x2026;?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xi Mukang,&#x201D; says Lady Suien impatiently.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, him!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But I knocked him out,&#x201D; says Lingshu. Fu Xia&#x2019;s eyes widen at her statement, apparently impressed..<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The fight ended and we started eating at the end of the <i>xu </i>hour, leaving before the middle of the <i>hai </i>hour. Xi Mukang was still around at the time,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
Fu Xia scratches his head, puzzled. &#x201C;Well, could be someone who looks like him, but I&#x2019;m certain that the servant was certain that the man was wearing the Jinkong uniform. They have visited Du Yao a few times before this. She saw him running across the courtyard during the <i>hai </i>hour and leapt over a wall.&#x201D; The young constable sighs, leaning back. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think she was lying to me&#x2026; though it <i>was</i> dark&#x2026;&#x201D; He seems to be getting despondent, unsure of his information.<br>
<br>
Letting out an even bigger sigh, Fu Xia tries to cheer up, and says, &#x201C;Anyway, I also questioned his lieutenants and the guards of the mansion. They said they knew nothing, and doubted this was over business. They seem rather convinced Chief Jiang did it.&#x201D; Shaking his head solemnly, he continues, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t trust them, though. Let&#x2019;s look closer. Something&#x2019;s fishy there&#x2026; my detective instinct is tingling.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Our investigation in the grounds matches  the scenario of a person fleeing from Du Yao&#x2019;s study and escaping over the wall,&#x201D; says Lady Suien. &#x201C;Judging from the footprints, the person would have possessed above average skill at <i>qinggong</i>, and he was also injured. With my tools I have determined that there was a struggle with Du Yao, and this person was slightly injured.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;we didn&#x2019;t find anything else&#x2026; there were no needles either,&#x201D; adds Cao&#x2019;er, slightly dejectedly. &#x201C;&#x2026;was hoping to find some&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There are a few rumours flying around. Some say Du Yao was in cahoots with some of the Grand Eunuchs to overthrow the Emperor, others say he was supporting the Emperor against those same eunuchs. Then there are those who say he was killed for, depending on who you ask, the Xuanming Jiuyin Holy Art, the Xiaoming Jiuyang Divine Skill, and the Wuxiang Qiankun Skill, and the named culprits range from the Jinkong Sect to the Man Tiger Pig. None of the people I asked think it has anything to do with the city&#x2019;s business,&#x201D; reports Qilin. Then, she shrugs. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think any of these rumours are particularly useful, there is far, far too much noise to sift through to get to the truth. We won&#x2019;t manage it in time. Of course, having these much useless rumours floating around is rather abnormal&#x2026; but I can&#x2019;t make any sense of it at the moment. Sorry.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Next, you begin detailing your search for the eunuch together with Yifang. It had seemed to be panning out as a fruitless search, but a random little act of kindness by Yifang towards an old homeless man had given you some interesting information. You think you would never have helped the man; for one, there was quite a lot of them in the city, and you did not think helping a single man would be of any use. Apparently, Yifang thought differently, and her way of thinking had given you a small lead&#x2026; a tiny fragment of luck.<br>
<br>
After the middle of the <i>hai </i>hour, the homeless man had seen someone matching Xiaofang&#x2019;s description arguing, and then fighting with a masked man in black, though his failing ears were not good enough to hear their words clearly. The unknown man had won, leaving behind Xiaofang on the ground. The homeless man was too afraid to venture out and hid, trying to sleep, but shortly after the night watch rang out the end of the <i>hai </i>hour and the beginning of the <i>zi </i>hour, he finally gathered enough courage to creep out from his shack of rags. By that time, Xiaofang&#x2019;s body was no longer there.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He could be dead,&#x201D; says Fu Xia quietly, looking down.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Or he survived and either crawled away or was picked up by someone else. Whatever it is, we know that he was still in the city late last night,&#x201D; says Lady Suien. &#x201C;If we follow up on the trail tonight, we might be able to get something useful.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The last piece of information comes from Chief Jiang himself; you had met with him alone, and he seemed to have approve of your actions. He told his story without prompting, recognizing the gravity of the situation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was discussing the theft of the manual with Du Yao from the end of the <i>xu </i>hour till sometime into the <i>hai </i>hour. I had quietly asked Xiaofang to come meet me at the entrance of the mansion around the start of the <i>hai </i>hour so that I could give him his next orders, but when I did not see him there, I felt that something was wrong. I snuck back into the mansion and went back to the study close to the middle of the <i>hai </i>hour. The study was dark, but I could sense a presence within&#x2026; and I heard something like a small tussle going on. The moment I entered the room, I heard Du Yao scream out and fall. There was a man clothed in black there. I struck out at the man with my short sword and drew blood, but he leapt out of the window and escaped. Shortly after, Du Yao&#x2019;s daughter arrived and screamed for the guards. I attempted to fight my way out. As you can see, I did not succeed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Having listened to Jiang Zheng quietly, you ask, &#x201C;What did Du Yao say about the manual?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have reason to believe he is not involved. He seemed to have discovered something during our talk, but he did not talk about it. Instead, he told me to return the next day, once he had gathered his thoughts. If you know Du Yao, you will know that there are some things that you cannot push.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And what about the Jinkong Sect?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is up in the air. Certainly, Du Yao did not confirm whether they were the culprits&#x2026; it is still possible.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm, I suppose that has nothing to do with the orders you were to give Xiaofang?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Jiang Zheng laughs suddenly, his hands slapping the metal bars. &#x201C;Good question. Yes, I suspected that Du Yao, being the man he is, would be neck deep in matters that may lead to the eunuchs either directly or indirectly. After talking to him, I was going to discuss it with Xiaofang as a matter of precaution. Could you ask him to meet with me later?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I would have brought him, but&#x2026; Xiaofang is missing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
This elicits a huge scowl from Jiang. &#x201C;That&#x2026; is not good.&#x201D; When he doesn&#x2019;t seem to be explaining further, you prod him for one. Jiang Zheng sighs. &#x201C;Either he has turned on us and is actually working for one of the Grand Eunuchs that do not like the Imperial Constabulary, or he has run afoul of a person who knows of his role with the eunuch department. I must say, even though he is my subordinate, I am perfectly willing to accept either explanation.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You do not trust a eunuch?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Trust no one,&#x201D; he says grimly.<br>
<br>
You leave the last parts of your conversation out at Jiang Zheng&#x2019;s request, only describing his testimony to the others.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps I should investigate the Jinkong Sect,&#x201D; offers Fu Xia. &#x201C;I am familiar with talking to pugilists, and I think after what we have found, we cannot rule out their involvement.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would rather focus our efforts here,&#x201D; says Lady Suien. &#x201C;Xiaofang is either in trouble, or involved with the murder.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Or both,&#x201D; says Lingshu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;I think I can confirm the cause of death if you allow me to open up the body with Qilin&#x2019;s help&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Would his daughter be okay with it, though?&#x201D; points out Qilin.<br>
<br>
Lingshu frowns for a second and then nods. &#x201C;I might just be able to get Miss Du to agree to that. Let me talk to her.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yifang looks at the other girls, a mixed expression on her face. It seems she is feeling a bit left out. You pat her on the head suddenly, causing her to give an alarmed squeak and hunch down, away from the physical touch.<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, you did well. If you did not help that man, we wouldn&#x2019;t have heard of what happened to Xiaofang.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She flushes slightly, and says, &#x201C;Really? It was something anyone would have done, giving him food and water.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not when those were the last of our travel supplies,&#x201D; you reply.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
It seems that the focus of the investigation tomorrow would be on following up the leads you have found today. Hopefully Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s inspection will enlighten you more about Du Yao&#x2019;s death and open up new avenues of inquiry.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You agree with Fu Xia&#x2019;s suggestion to investigate the Jinkong Sect, and ask him to travel out to their location.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You think the investigation would be better served by focusing it on the city, and tell Fu Xia that he should stay put and help out here.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Finally, the duck arrives.<br>
<br>
The aroma is tantalizingly fragrant, and the glistening, crispy skin looks awfully appetizing. The waiter does not set it down on your table, however, holding the dish in his hand with an apologetic look on his face. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
He bows and says, &#x201C;Valued customer, you see&#x2026; someone else is insisting that they get this last duck. They&#x2019;re willing to pay more for it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; You raise an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
Qilin hisses at you, &#x201C;<i>No</i>. No negotiations.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Waiter, we <i>will </i>pay you at least fifty percent more for that duck. It is the last one this week, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; The mysterious customer appears, talking in an affected baritone and looking straight at you. &#x201C;I must have it. I&#x2019;m sure you will understand, won&#x2019;t you, you&#x2026; you&#x2026; you&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You stare at the customer, and the customer stares back.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;you &#x2026;you &#x2026;you&#x2026;&#x201D; continues the stunned person with the big turban wrapped around the head and what appears to be a moustache and beard stuck on to the face. You touch the top of your lip, pointing at it repeatedly. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s peeling off.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi claps her hand to the fake beard and says, &#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s not!&#x201D; while still using that false, forced baritone that she thinks is going to fool you. &#x201C;Anyway, first things first! That duck is mine! I&#x2019;m paying for it!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You <i>haven&#x2019;t </i>paid for anything yet,&#x201D; snarls Qilin. &#x201C;We ordered it first!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, as long as it&#x2019;s not on the table yet, it&#x2019;s not <i>yours</i>,&#x201D; retorts Yunzi. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve travelled so far for this... I will not let you have it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe we could share?&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
The resulting &#x201C;No!&#x201D; from both girls is loud enough to hush the entire restaurant, all three floors of it.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>She&#x2019;s welcome to the duck if she wants it. You give Yunzi the duck. Qilin will be unhappy, but it is better than causing a scene.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You tell Yunzi that in addition to what she&#x2019;s paying the restaurant for the duck, she has to pay you on top of it. The extra money might make Qilin feel better.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>There&#x2019;s only one way to resolve this: you fight for the duck.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You reveal that you have been marked by the Flame in order to get her to lay off the duck.<br>

					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Follow Up</span></b><br>
<br>
When you move your hand to snatch the plate of duck, Yunzi reacts accordingly. She grabs your wrist and reaches for the duck with her other hand, but with a light twist your hand slips through her grasp. You swat her palm away and nab the plate, pulling it from the petrified waiter. Grinning, you spin the plate on one finger as the duck rocks to and fro.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Yunzi gives you a fierce smile, rolling up her sleeves. &#x201C;Is this supposed to be a challenge?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;Hey, if you want the duck, come and get it! If you can.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a yell, Yunzi leaps at you, her eyes pinned tightly on the roast fowl. Holding the plate out of her reach, you fend off her grabs with one hand. The swiftness of her movements forces you to retreat; you leap onto the table behind you and she follows suit. You move nimbly around the plates of food, hopping and stepping backwards as Yunzi&#x2019;s moves speed up. She ducks and spins to the left; you respond, but realize too late that it is a feint. Swerving to the right, she catches you off guard and reaches to the right. Her fingers almost touch the plate &#x2013; you jerk your hand away in a hurry and make a misstep. The tip of your boot catches on a bowl of soup, up-ending it over another patron.<br>
<br>
Letting out an offended roar, he attempts to grab at your legs. You leap away, causing his arm to strike a woman across the face.<br>
<br>
Her husband is not pleased.<br>
<br>
Another brawl erupts, but you have no time to admire the chaos as Yunzi is upon you again. Descending from above, she kicks at your plate-holding hand. The impact causes the plate to fly into the air, sending the duck up together with it. You manage to catch the plate, but she steps on your shoulder and jumps off, reaching for her goal as she laughs triumphantly.<br>
<br>
Before she can even lay a finger on the duck, a dozen crimson silk strings wrap around the bird&#x2019;s body. They retract, reeling in the duck towards Qilin&#x2019;s ready fingers. Her eyes are wide with glee.<br>
<br>
The strings snap.<br>
<br>
Another turban-wearing person cuts through the silk with bare hands &#x2013; the Amesha Spenta, Armaiti &#x2013; and grabs at the duck.<br>
<br>
You throw the plate at her hand. It misses by a good few feet and breaks on a distant wall, but your move distracts Armaiti long enough for you to close the distance and snatch the duck back. Swinging it by a well-cooked, tender thigh, you duck under Yunzi&#x2019;s punch, but find yourself cornered by Armaiti. Maiden and Amesha Spenta attack simultaneously from both sides. Your hand blurs in a quick, dexterous movement &#x2013; they manage to grab your wrists, but find no duck in either palm.<br>
<br>
Yunzi frowns, taking a second to realize what you did. &#x201C;Up!&#x201D; she shouts as she raises her head, watching the duck soar up towards the ceiling in its last flight. Taking advantage of the distraction, you break their hold before they can jump and thrust your arms out, your fingers grabbing at the chests of the two women. As you expected, they react immediately to protect their chastity, leaving you free to go after the duck in victory; it should fall back into your waiting arms any moment now.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s not there.<br>
<br>
You land lightly on the third floor, looking around at the panicking customers, but the duck is nowhere to be seen at first glance.<br>
<br>
Then, you spot a short, dirty girl leaping down from the second floor, with what looks like a duck&#x2019;s wing poking out from between the front of her clothes. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s got it!&#x201D; you shout out as you jump down after her. &#x201C;That girl!&#x201D; It takes a while for your companions to react, and that difference is all the thief needs to make it out of the restaurant. Yunzi rushes out while you follow close behind, but it is too late. Given the dinner-time crowd on the streets, it would be nearly impossible to find that girl. The both of you go back into Xinchun dejectedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is entirely your fault,&#x201D; growls Yunzi as she glares at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe you shouldn&#x2019;t have tried to take our duck,&#x201D; you retort.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; sighs Qilin. &#x201C;I laced the duck with a poison through the strings.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2026; what?&#x201D; Yunzi stares at her. Qilin gives her a mischievous grin in return. &#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t really think I was going to let anyone else have it without a little gift, did you?&#x201D; Looking at everyone&#x2019;s pale expressions, she puts a hand to her mouth in mock surprise. &#x201C;Oh dear, worry not! It isn&#x2019;t anything lethal. Just&#x2026; uncomfortable.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The meal progresses relatively uneventfully after the brawl ends, sans duck.<br>
<br>
You do hear something surprising from Yunzi, however.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are&#x2026; gathering the Ashina?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am sending out word to any of my scattered folk that I am alive, and that they should gather at the temple&#x2026; don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m not planning some sort of invasion. Not yet, anyway&#x2026; though I will have to make sure Ahura does not catch wind of my plans,&#x201D; she replies calmly as she takes a few sips of tea.<br>
<br>
You shake your head. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know you planned this. I thought you were just touring the country.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I <i>was </i>planning to do only that, but I met with<i> that</i> woman shortly after I left Tufan.&#x201D; Yunzi frowns as she recalls her encounter. &#x201C;She was the one that gave me the various locations of my people and encouraged me to contact them again.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What woman?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, sorry, I didn&#x2019;t tell you about it? The woman I refer to is a very beautiful woman; definitely enough to turn your head. She called herself Lady Ji, so I thought she was a member of royalty&#x2026; she certainly had the stature befitting one,&#x201D; says Yunzi. &#x201C;She was the one that guided me to that&#x2026; that mansion with the toad the last time. I must have forgotten to tell you about it.&#x201D; She makes a wry smile and continues, &#x201C;So, what are <i>you </i>doing here, Xu Jing?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You tell her about the current situation and ask for her help with the investigation.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You tell her about the current situation but do not ask for her help with the investigation.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You tell her nothing about the current situation, making up a suitable excuse for your presence.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You tell her about what happened at the Fire Temple.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You don&#x2019;t tell her about what happened at the Fire Temple.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Jing,&#x201D; says Qilin sweetly later that night. She marches into the room with the girl who stole the duck in her grasp, tied up in crimson silk. You look at them, at a loss for words.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The duck-thief came knocking at our door looking for a cure to some nasty laxatives,&#x201D; smiles Qilin. &#x201C;What a stroke of good luck.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are still not getting that duck back, unless you want to eat watery shit,&#x201D; hisses the dirty girl, who looks to be about twelve and reminds you of the first time you met Cao&#x2019;er&#x2026; though this one definitely talks more.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Quite the mouth on you, you brat.&#x201D; Qilin is smiling, but you can sense the anger boiling off of her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Brat? You&#x2019;re the brat here!&#x201D; exclaims the girl. &#x201C;Who would poison such heavenly duck?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If I didn&#x2019;t, I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to teach some dirty urchin thief some lessons now, would I?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Qilin,&#x201D; you interrupt, &#x201C;Why <i>did </i>you bring her here?&#x201D; You think she could have handled it by herself, if it was just a case of duck thievery.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I almost forgot. She asked specifically to meet you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You?&#x201D; You look at the dirty girl, and she looks back at you with her large eyes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In fact,&#x201D; continues Qilin, an uncharacteristic nervousness coming into her expression, &#x201C;she asked specifically to meet with the one-eyed boy who is practicing Wuxiang Qiankun.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You freeze up &#x2013; how could she have known that? You did not use even a hint of it in the little argument over the duck.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are like an open book, boy,&#x201D; sneers the girl.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How did you&#x2026; who are you-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
The girl laughs haughtily, managing to fold her arms even while tied up. &#x201C;Bow before me and perhaps I might answer your questions!&#x201D; Examining her by sight, you find nothing strange about her: she appears to be a perfectly normal &#x2013; if really unkempt &#x2013; twelve year-old girl with only the slightest training in martial arts.<br>
<br>
You sit back and close your eye.<br>
<br>
The girl lets out a puzzled &#x201C;Eh?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that all you need from me? A simple, single bow, and you answer all my questions?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-well&#x2026; maybe if you feed me from now on?&#x201D; she ventures with an awkward little grin. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a hassle finding food without servants.&#x201D; You get the feeling that this is the real reason for this strange little girl to approach you&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Agree to her terms &#x2013; you allow her to be a part of your retinue. If she requires that you give her a single bow, that&#x2019;s not too much of a price to pay.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You reject her terms &#x2013; if she does not want to tell you without setting conditions, you do not need to listen. You have your pride.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You reject her terms&#x2026; and silence the girl. She knows too much.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Poison.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s verdict is conclusive.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was very fast-acting poison that stopped his heart. He would have been dead within seconds of penetration,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;I am not familiar with the type of poison used, so it&#x2019;s <i>definitely </i>something not commonly seen in the Central Plains.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Were they delivered by the needles?&#x201D; asks Lady Suien.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Most likely&#x2026; but there was something strange about the puncture wounds&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Cao&#x2019;er. &#x201C;&#x2026;it might not be actual needles&#x2026;&#x201D; She does not seem to be able to confirm anything else, however.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is there anything else you discovered by opening up Du Yao&#x2019;s body?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er nods. &#x201C;&#x2026;yes. The body was put on ice so I did not notice it at first&#x2026; but there are traces of a cold <i>yin </i>qi left within it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Lady Suien falls deep in thought. &#x201C;&#x2026;poison&#x2026; cold&#x2026;&#x201D; After a while, she shakes her head and says, &#x201C;There might be something here, but I will need to consult my books. We have only two more days left before the garrison commander arrives&#x2026; we will need results by then.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Given that the sword wound on Du Yao&#x2019;s body matches that of a constable&#x2019;s sword, I think we need to find Xiaofang as soon as possible,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Surely none of us could have done it!&#x201D; exclaims Fu Xia. &#x201C;Someone else might have forged a sword of similar dimensions.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fu Xia is right,&#x201D; says Lady Suien. &#x201C;Still, we cannot rule anything out.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He looks despondent and says, &#x201C;Well, I just don&#x2019;t want to suspect my friends, Lady Suien.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Rule nothing out,&#x201D; she repeats firmly. &#x201C;I believe you have to continue gathering information in light of what we already know. Get to work.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Fu leaves with an apologetic bow, followed by the others. He closes the door behind him, leaving you and Lady Suien alone in the room.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, what do you think?&#x201D; she asks.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;About?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fu Xia and Xiaofang. Which of them do you suspect? Given the circumstances, it is likely either one or both of them. They are the only constables that do not have an alibi during Du Yao&apos;s death, if we rule out Chief Jiang.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You chuckle. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a rather cold woman, aren&#x2019;t you? What type of question is that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She stares at you from under her long eyelashes. &#x201C;It is my work.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, if you suspect them, what <i>should </i>we do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would say we have two options. Let Fu Xia go free for now, and gather more evidence in the meantime&#x2026; or take him in and interrogate him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about Xiaofang?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course, we also need to find him as soon as possible. We should devote the rest of our resources to tracking him down&#x2026; he will be able to answer many of our questions.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You are in favour of letting Fu Xia go free until you have more evidence to work with. If he is innocent, you would be hurting him, while if he is guilty, you might be tipping him off by acting too quickly.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You are in favour of taking Fu Xia into custody. He has been acting suspiciously, and by letting him go free you think he would have greater chances of sabotaging the investigation. It would be wiser to capture and interrogate him as soon as possible.<br>
<br>

            <h3>二十九 · Day of the Trial</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Day of the Trial</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Yunzi shoots up, slamming her palms on the table in surprise and attracting some looks from the nearby tables. Her fake beard almost drops off, and as she frantically readjusts it, you gesture at her to be more quiet and to sit down. Her expression continually changes as she tries to get to grips with the situation. &#x201C;I&#x2026; is he really&#x2026; You&#x2019;re lying, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We need proof, Holy Maiden. Let me contact Vahista at the Temple,&#x201D; whispers Armaiti.<br>
<br>
Without saying another word, you show Yunzi and Armaiti the ember &#x2013; the small spark that the Flame had left within you. That finally convinces them.<br>
<br>
Yunzi takes a deep breath, a vacant look in her eyes. &#x201C;If that is the case, then&#x2026; but&#x2026; what if&#x2026;&#x201D; mumbles the girl unintelligibly, &#x201C;&#x2026;that means you are&#x2026; and I have to&#x2026; with you&#x2026;&#x201D; Life returns to her gaze, and together with it a very obvious blush as blood rushes to her head, the realization of her current circumstances striking home. &#x201C;Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.&#x201D; Letting out an awkward laugh, Yunzi stands up rigidly, knocking over a few dishes as she does so. &#x201C;T-t-t-this is a bad joke, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait-&#x201C; Armaiti reaches out, but Yunzi has already run out of the restaurant, screaming. Turning to you, she gives you a quick, apologetic bow before going after her mistress.<br>
<br>
You guess she won&#x2019;t be helping you out after all; it looks like that revelation was too shocking and important for her to focus on any investigations at the moment.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Later that night, you find yourself bowing to a little girl, forehead plastered to the floor.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You really have no pride or dignity, do you?&#x201D; she sniffs admonishingly, though you can hear the pleasure in her voice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Strangely, it is less shameful to me to kneel before a little girl than I am a burly man,&#x201D; you say without looking up. &#x201C;Would you like your food now? I am afraid you took the last duck in the city&#x2026; I hope you enjoyed it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A-ah, well, it was nice. Of course I enjoyed it. You have the makings of a good servant, boy. You may be at ease.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was born one,&#x201D; you reply smoothly as you get up. Qilin is making a look at you that says &#x2018;<i>this girl is your responsibility</i>&#x2019;.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good, very good! I like you. I think I&#x2019;ll keep you!&#x201D; laughs the girl.<br>
<br>
You think it a rather daring statement coming from someone who plans to be leeching off you for the forseeable future, but you hold your tongue. Before the conversation can progress any further, however, Qilin drags her off, saying, &#x201C;The two of you can talk after you have your bath, girl. You&#x2019;re really dirtying up our room.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
They return minutes later, the girl scrubbed clean. Qilin looks exhausted from the effort. The girl&#x2019;s hair is jet-black and long, almost reaching down to her knees. Her skin is as pale as snow and her eyes large and shining, granting her a doll-like beauty. You cannot resist poking at her fair cheek &#x2013; it is soft. The girl reddens and swats your hand away angrily. &#x201C;Such insolence!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, what brings you to Youxia City, mistress?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now, don&#x2019;t be surprised when I tell you this,&#x201D; grins the girl arrogantly, &#x201C;but I am actually <i>not </i>a normal little girl. I am the Tianshan Child Elder, master of the Tianshan mountains who has been also been called the Thousand Year Snow Devil and the Eternal Ice Beauty, amongst many other names.&#x201D; She looks at your face and frowns. &#x201C;You do not seem very surprised.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; ah, I had my suspicions,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Why are you all the way down here&#x2026; and so dirty, too?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, that is a long story,&#x201D; she grumbles, her mood clearly taking a turn for the worse. &#x201C;Some imbeciles in the Xueguizi thought I had the Xuanming Jiuyin Holy Art. Many of the Xueguizi&#x2019;s techniques stem from that silly manual, but we have not held that book in centuries. My predecessors gave it away somewhere in the Central Plains.&#x201D; She slams the table with her small fist, fuming. &#x201C;In fact, only someone who knew the actual techniques in that book would be able to seal away my inner strength! Idiots! Fools!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I am not a normal little girl, but currently I am only barely better than a normal little girl,&#x201D; she sighs. &#x201C;It was someone from the orthodox sects that visited Tianshan just recently, searching for the manual. My memories are hazy&#x2026; I do not remember many of the circumstances that led up to the sealing thanks to those bastards, but I do recall my lieutenants turning on me in their greed for power.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see, Mistress Tianshan&#x2026; you are here to track down the culprit?&#x201D; you ask politely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I barely escaped with my life! I came down here thinking that that brat, Wang Zhengchong, would be able to help, but it turns out that he somehow got himself killed two years back.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You suppose that is why she is here in Youxia City &#x2013; she must have been heading to Wudang before she found out about the news.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Anyway, if I undo my seals normally it will take me fifty years to regain my former strength. I&#x2019;ll have aged into an old hag by then,&#x201D; scowls the Tianshan Child Elder. &#x201C;I need to find the Xuanming Jiuyin manual and learn the techniques within to reverse what has been done to me. You have the Wuxiang Qiankun &#x2013; that much I can tell, from my experience, and if that is the case it is your destiny to collide with the pracititioners of the other manuals.&#x201D; She gives you a sweet, child-like smile. &#x201C;So, all I have to do is to follow you around! Worry not, having me around has its&#x2026; advantages, even if I might not be able to fight like I used to.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Having heard what she has to say, you sigh. &#x201C;You <i>better </i>pull your weight, then.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is that? What is that attitude of yours? Show respect to your elders!&#x201D; she shouts.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Elders? I only see someone <i>barely </i>better than a normal little girl in front of me,&#x201D; you grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-y-you!&#x201D; stutters the little girl angrily. Laughing, you pat her head gently as if she were some feral kitten to be tamed. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, I won&#x2019;t abandon you. Even if you are useless.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She seems to accept that, and withdraws sullenly, glaring at you. &#x201C;Fine, I&#x2019;ll let you see how useful I can be. A-anyway, from now on, call me&#x2026; yes, call me Xuezi. That will do. It would be best not to refer to me as the Child Elder in public.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
In the end, you do not manage to gather any more evidence on your searches. Yunzi has not left the city yet, perhaps having other matters to see to, but she flees from you every time you attempt to approach her. Just as you are about to give up, you find Xiaofang just hours before the trial &#x2013; or rather, Yifang and Lingshu do. Having built up some sort of strange, inexplicable caramaderie with the poorer of the city&#x2019;s inhabitants on their forays, they managed to locate the young eunuch unconscious in a rundown sickhouse, feverish and half-dead.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Poisoned&#x2026; again, never seen this type of poison before&#x2026;&#x201D; says Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not familiar to me too. Some components of it seem to be similar to our Wudu in origin, but I can say for sure that we do not have anything like this at the moment,&#x201D; comments Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;actually, same poison with Du Yao&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure, Cao&#x2019;er?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She nods. &#x201C;Different body, different reaction&#x2026; very interesting&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Taking care of the eunuch, they also find that he has been struck by the Qishang Fist of the Jinkong Sect, similar to the slaughtered constables that had been the start of this entire case. His injuries were not as life-threatening as the poison, however, and Cao&#x2019;er told you that it would take at least a week to stabilize his condition.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Out of the way, let me have a look.&#x201D; Xuezi &#x2013; the Tianshan Child Elder &#x2013; pushes her way bossily to Xiaofang&#x2019;s side.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;H-hey, who let a kid into the room?&#x201D; asks Fu Xia.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shut up, you insolent pup!&#x201D; shouts the Child Elder. &#x201C;Now&#x2026; this mark, yes. It is unmistakeable.&#x201D; She points at the tiny holes on Xiaofang&#x2019;s chest.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;same holes on Du Yao&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hanbing Needles (&#x5BD2;&#x51B0;&#x91DD;, Ice-Cold Needles). It is a Xueguizi technique, where we make sharp needles from icy <i>qi</i>, drawing water to freeze from the air itself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; nods Lady Suien. &#x201C;That would explain why the murder weapon could not be found. They melted. How long would a needle take to melt?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It can vary,&#x201D; replies Xuezi. &#x201C;Expert practitioners can make it last for longer, while amateurs can hold the needle together for no more than scant seconds.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Could they freeze poison in liquid form?&#x201D; asks Lady Suien again. &#x201C;Could they dip the ice needles in poison?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is all possible,&#x201D; says Xuezi. Then, she turns to you, a proud, arrogant smirk on her face. &#x201C;See?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You pat her on the head, causing her to explode in anger at your patronizing ways.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Even if you had identified the murder weapon, however, you had not confirmed the murderer. There were no other leads that bore fruit; the Jinkong Sect members <i>did</i> have an alibi for the time Xiaofang was attacked. You would have liked to wait until Xiaofang woke up so that you could ask him some questions, but unfortunately it looks like the powers-that-be in Youxia City would not wait any longer; neither would the garrison commander and the bandits led by Pang Xiaohu. Unrest in the city was rising at the uncertainty of the current situation, and they had agreed to close this case of Du Yao&#x2019;s murder so that they could move on to other issues&#x2026; like how the city would be governed from now on.<br>
<br>
You presented all of the evidence you had to the presiding judges &#x2013; all three of them, Du Yao&#x2019;s lieutenant, the garrison commander, and Pang Xiaohu, who seems out of place sitting with the other two. It was not the usual way a court would be conducted, but Youxia City had some leeway to set its own legal practices due to its autonomy.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is all you found?&#x201D; asks the garrison commander. &#x201C;It seems to point towards a foreign assassin being the murderer.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They might have escaped the city long ago,&#x201D; sighs the lieutenant. &#x201C;Still, there is nothing that says Jiang Zheng <i>isn&#x2019;t </i>the murderer. He might actually know this needle technique in secret.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Pang Xiaohu offers no insight, sharpening his axes in boredom.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps a confession is in order,&#x201D; continues the lieutenant.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps the city simply is too insecure, allowing the assassin to escape,&#x201D; says the garrison commander. &#x201C;But I can see the appeal of obtaining a confession, in the absence of any other possible suspect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It looks like they will order Jiang Zheng tortured in an attempt to make him confess.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You keep quiet. Since the garrison commander and Du Yao&#x2019;s lieutenant appear to be agreeing on this matter for some reason, it would be best not to upset the boat. The evidence you have managed to gather is there, and if it cannot convince them of his innocence, that is all you can do. The truth will out itself eventually, and perhaps the chief will be a necessary sacrifice to keep the peace.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You speak up, attempting to persuade them that the true assassin has fled the city. It is in fact a very likely scenario, though you cannot be sure whether it is the truth. If it works, however, you at least spare Chief Jiang from any torture, though you are also unsure what future ramifications this conclusion would have for Youxia City.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You still think Fu Xia is hiding something. You had refrained from interrogating him until you found more evidence that might point to him, but you have no choice now but to bring him into the spotlight for a public interrogation in a last-ditch attempt to fully solve the case even in the absence of that evidence... although you are not sure whether it will actually be fruitful at this point.<br>
<br>

            <h3>三十 · A New Suspect</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">A New Suspect</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait!&#x201D; you call out to the court. The lieutenant&#x2019;s raised hand lowers slowly, the flat wooden stick that would have been thrown to order Jiang&#x2019;s torture still held in his fingers. Pang Xiaohu finally looks away from his axes. You step towards the center of the court, besides the stockade that Jiang Zheng is held in, and turn towards Fu Xia.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fu Xia, where were you on the night of the crime?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The court is quiet. Both spectators and judges are stunned into silence by your actions. Jiang Zheng stares up at you, his face solemn though seemingly unsurprised. &#x201C;Xu Jing,&#x201D; says the lieutenant, &#x201C;if you are trying to delay for time&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not. Let me continue my queries,&#x201D; you respond, your posture not giving an inch.<br>
<br>
The garrison commander looks at you and nods. &#x201C;Very well. Continue, but make it quick.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;H-hey, this is not funny, Mister Xu!&#x201D; Fu Xia gives a nervous chuckle as he glances about him. &#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Where were you on the night of the crime?&#x201D; you repeat.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I was having dinner with you. Come on, what are you trying to get at here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You left the restaurant quite early, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Because I was being chased by three monks! They were attacking me and I had to run&#x2026; and then I got lost coming back. You know how winding these streets are.&#x201D; He shakes his head and sighs heavily. &#x201C;Really, where did this come from?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You smile. &#x201C;The monks attacked you, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I just said that,&#x201D; he frowns. &#x201C;I came back all injured. You saw me too. Cuts and all.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I did,&#x201D; you acknowledge his statement. &#x201C;Would you mind letting me examine your injuries in more detail?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Does this have <i>anything </i>to do with the case in question?&#x201D; says the lieutenant impatiently.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, that&#x2019;s right, it doesn&#x2019;t matter, does it?&#x201D; echoes Fu Xia quickly.<br>
<br>
You glance at Qilin. She understands your intentions and smiles. Stepping behind him, she gives Fu Xia a swift boot to his rear, knocking him into the center of the hall. &#x201C;What-&#x201C; Fu Xia shouts out, but you are upon him in a flash. You seal his acupoints, immobilizing his body. Then, you strip off his tunic with a flourish while he continues protesting. There are still bruises on his torso, as well as a large, unhealed cut across his left arm. You beckon to Cao&#x2019;er and ask her to investigate the wound.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;inflicted on the night of the murder&#x2026;&#x201D; she whispers almost inaudibly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was inflicted on the night of the murder,&#x201D; you call out, repeating Cao&#x2019;ers words.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I got into a brawl, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201D; complains Fu Xia. &#x201C;Why are you trying to frame me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did the monks find a sword or two somewhere? As I recall, they were unarmed,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;This cut was clearly made by a sword. Could it have been a constable&#x2019;s sword?&#x201D; Jiang Zheng is staring at Fu Xia intently, as if trying to make out if he could have been the man-in-black that assassinated Du Yao.<br>
<br>
Fu Xia&#x2019;s face pales, though he is still unable to move his body. His expression scrunches up into a grimace. &#x201C;This&#x2026; I&#x2026; look, there is an explanation for this!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then explain.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I shouldn&#x2019;t&#x2026; okay, if you insist. But don&#x2019;t blame me. It was Xiaofang. He attacked me while I was making my way back from the brawl.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You stare at him. &#x201C;Why would Xiaofang attack you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Look,&#x201D; he tries to grin, though it comes off awkwardly, &#x201C;you know how he&#x2019;s actually working for the eunuchs, right? He&#x2019;s probably a mole for them in our constabulary. I called out to him on the streets, tried to ask him why he was wandering around, but he got angry. He shouted back at me and struck the first blow. That&#x2019;s the cut. I was caught by surprise. I managed to fight him off and run away.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t you reveal this that night?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-well&#x2026; of course I couldn&#x2019;t. I mean, what if Xiaofang found out I told on him? I would be <i>killed</i>! I was just hoping to find him and talk to him again so that he understood I wasn&#x2019;t actually trying to harm him. I&#x2019;m sure it was all a misunderstanding on his part.&#x201D; Fu Xia talks quickly, sweat pouring down his face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have no proof, Xu Jing. You shouldn&#x2019;t accuse me without proof,&#x201D; he says. His confidence is gradually returning.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xiaofang was injured by the same technique that killed Du Yao. How would that be possible if the person he was arguing with wasn&#x2019;t the killer?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe there was another person that fought with him before I met him? When I found him he was already looking rather poorly.  He could have come across the killer and been injured then. But really, you know how the eunuchs are. Maybe it was Xiaofang himself who was the killer, and then he was betrayed by his accomplice? They could have learnt the same techniques. But I have no proof for that, just like you have no proof that I did it!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If Xiaofang was the killer, he would have been injured by Chief Jiang&#x2019;s weapon. During our examination, we saw no proof of any such injury. In fact, he was attacked by Jinkong Sect techniques.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, then someone <i>else </i>was the killer, and they attacked Xiaofang before or after he met me! I mean, in your reports you said Xiaofang disappeared to the sickhouse by himself, who knows what happened then?&#x201D; cries out Fu Xia. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m innocent! I mean, how could I know something like poisoned ice needles? That&#x2019;s more of something an eunuch would do!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know eunuchs. They are sneaky,&#x201D; mutters the garrison commander.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, it would explain a lot of things. He assassinated Lord Du, fled, was injured by his accomplices to silence him&#x2026;&#x201D; comments the lieutenant. It looks like they are more willing to accept Fu Xia&#x2019;s explanation, especially since it comes with a handy scapegoat.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do not think Xiaofang did it.&#x201D; Jiang speaks out, his voice heavy.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that so, Chief Jiang?&#x201D; The garrison commander appears to be surprised. &#x201C;If he did not do it, then did you do it after all?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was not me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you mean to imply that the young constable is lying and is the true culprit?&#x201D; asks the lieutenant.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, are you all really serious?&#x201D; Fu Xia shouts. &#x201C;There is no proof that I did it! I&#x2019;m not lying!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe we should put the bamboo to him,&#x201D; suggests the lieutenant. &#x201C;Perhaps we will find out if he is lying after he has his legs squeezed a bit. If he doesn&#x2019;t confess, then we know he&#x2019;s telling the truth and the eunuch probably did it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is a farce,&#x201D; laughs Pang Xiaohu. &#x201C;Come now, we all know it does not really matter who did it. Let me chop this Fu&#x2019;s head off with my axe and we can end the story. He&apos;s just a constable gone rogue anyway, right? I&apos;m sure the Tang Emperor didn&apos;t order him to do it, right? Some people go mad and do silly, bad things, it&apos;s just how the world is. So... yeah. Chop chop. Quickest way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t! I didn&#x2019;t do it!&#x201D; He is practically screaming by now, but his story still does not seem to add up. You suspect that he is not telling the truth yet.<br>
<br>
You step back while the judges deliberate their next course of action. &#x201C;Qilin, do you have anything like a truth serum?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, there&#x2019;s no drug that is so convenient&#x2026; wait, I think I could try something, but I&#x2019;m not sure if it would react well to his body. The Wudu Cult has been working on a little toy. It <i>should </i>theoretically make someone more eager to talk, but on the last ten animals I have tried it on for lethality tests, only two have survived longer than ten minutes. I am not sure how it would work on a human &#x2013; it might not be effective at all,&#x201D; mutters Qilin.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You let Pang Xiaohu take Fu Xia&#x2019;s head and end the case. Jiang Zheng may not be too happy if you take this route, but it&#x2019;s the simplest and quickest way.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You have Fu Xia tortured to see if he says anything. If he breaks, he will be found guilty, and your suspicion will be proven correct; if not, then you&#x2019;ll have to accept that Xiaofang has been painted as the culprit <i>in absentia</i>, and will be convicted for the murder.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You have Qilin administer her potion to him. It is untested, but on the off chance that it works, he might confess everything. That would make things a lot simpler, as well as possibly gaining you a lot of information about who is behind all this. Of course, it might prove lethal to Fu Xia if he is unfortunate.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You drain Fu Xia&apos;s <i>qi </i>in an attempt to force him to use his <i>neigong </i>to resist your absorption. If he does know the ice needle technique, there will be a hint to be found there; once he uses his <i>neigong </i>you would be able to pick up the same icy <i>qi </i>that was found in Du Yao&#x2019;s body and replicate it with Wuxiang Qiankun. However, to do that, you would have to reveal this ability of yours...<br>

            <h3>三十一 · Bloody Truth</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bloody Truth</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re sure&#x2026;&#x201D; Qilin walks right up to the frozen Fu Xia, and after observing him for a few minutes, holds up a long, slender needle, its center hollow. She concentrates on it, focusing her <i>qi</i>.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;H-hey, what are you going to do with that?&#x201D; asks Fu Xia nervously. She smiles at him sweetly and stabs him right in the centre of his forehead. The needle penetrates the skull and sinks in deep. A single drop of blood trickles down his nose. The constable&#x2019;s eyes roll up, showing white. There is a disturbing, gurgling noise from his throat as his lower jaw hangs open loosely.<br>
<br>
Everyone in the court gasps.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Qilin, I hope you didn&#x2019;t just kill him,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, darling. This is just the first step of the operation. Now, where did I put that&#x2026; ah, here it is!&#x201D; Qilin opens up a little satchel. Tilting his head backwards, she pours the contents into the needle. Then, she places her hands on the sides of his head and shakes it gently. &#x201C;That should do it.&#x201D; Clapping her hands twice, she skips away hurriedly from Fu Xia, ducking behind you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201D; You glance at her &#x2013; you can tell from the look in her eyes that she&#x2019;s anticipating the coming moments rather eagerly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I haven&#x2019;t tried it on a person before&#x2026; so he might explode. I had that sort of thing happen right next to me once. It was rather messy,&#x201D; she answers.<br>
<br>
Fu Xia moans softly. His head lolls to one side.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alright,&#x201D; whispers Qilin after a few more minutes pass, &#x201C;I think you can try it now. This seems rather different from what I was expecting, but there&#x2019;s no going back.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You tell me that now?&#x201D; Shaking your head, you take a deep breath &#x2013; this feels slightly disturbing to you &#x2013; and approach Fu Xia. &#x201C;Can you hear me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; hear you. I hear you. I hear you,&#x201D; he chants, his voice dry and listless. His eyes are still rolled up in his head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My name is&#x2026; Fu Xia.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you performing some kind of hypnotic acupuncture?&#x201D; asks the garrison commander, his eyes transfixed to the scene.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;something like that,&#x201D; you say &#x2013; you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to explain it well anyway. You had better hurry before the drug loses its effect or does something bad to Fu Xia. Turning your attention back to him, you decide to jump straight to the most important question of all.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did you kill Du Yao?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I killed Du Yao.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s it!&#x201D; shouts the lieutenant excitedly. &#x201C;We have him! We have a confession!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Still, if you are to be honest with yourself&#x2026; you are not entirely sure if the drug is making him tell the truth, or if it is merely causing him to follow your suggestions.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I killed Du Yao,&#x201D; the newly confirmed murderer repeats. His arms twitch. You were sure that you had sealed his pressure points properly; with his level of skill, he would not be able to undo it so soon. Fu Xia begins chattering, his teeth colliding noisily. A strange, dark liquid spills from the needle in his head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is new,&#x201D; you hear Qilin mutter from behind you.<br>
<br>
The air changes. The temperature seems to drop, a chill permeating the hall. With an ear-piercing scream, Fu Xia breaks free of his seals, throwing his hands into the air. His fingers begin clawing at his temples, scrabbling as if he is trying to get at something inside his head. &#x201C;I killed Du Yao!&#x201D; he screams. &#x201C;I killed Du Yao!&#x201D; Digging deep, bloody furrows down the side of his cheeks, Fu Xia takes one step towards you, crying out hoarsely. His eyes bulge out, crimson lines branching across the white. The gurgle floats up again from the depths of his throat, gradually rising in volume until it suddenly cuts off with a choking noise. Fu Xia falls silent.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Killed&#x2026;&#x201D; he mumbles. &#x201C;Killed Du Yao. Kill. Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With only a ghastly wail as a warning, Fu Xia leaps towards you with a sudden burst of speed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Get back!&#x201D; you shout out, waving at your companions. They scatter, giving Fu Xia and you a wide berth. A dozen Youxia guards run out to restrain him, but to no avail. He lashes out like a rabid animal, his fists and feet raining down blow after blow after blow, each attack accompanied by a rage-filled scream. The sound of breaking bones fills the hall. The guards are flung away like rag dolls. He seems to have gained surprising speed and power, beyond what you originally thought him capable of. Is it the effect of the drug?<br>
<br>
Having defeated the guards, Fu Xia comes after you again, screaming madly as blood flows from the self-inflicted wounds on his face. You retaliate by attempting to immobilize him again, but to no effect; he is somehow changed enough that it will no longer work. A powerful punch grazes your chest &#x2013; his movements might be fast and strong, but they are still sloppy. You evade his furious assault by a hair&#x2019;s breadth, ducking and weaving between his blows. Letting the spider silk unravel into your palm, you loop it around Fu Xia, hoping to restrain him this way. He howls, exerting his <i>neigong</i>. The silk freezes, becoming brittle enough to shatter with his next move.<br>
<br>
You spot a tiny glint between his fingers and instinctively spin aside instead of blocking his next attack &#x2013; as he throws his hand out, tiny shards of translucent ice fly past you.<br>
<br>
<i>Hanbing Needles</i>. There is no longer any doubt.<br>
<br>
Going on the attack, you close the gap between the two of you. Fu Xia tries to grab your throat, but you bat his arm aside with your elbow. In such close quarters, he is unable to strike at you properly. You swiftly take advantage of your position to execute The Hidden Dragon In The Fields; your palm drives into his ribs, causing him to cough up dark red blood. Reaching out, you grasp the shoulder of his outstretched arm with your Shouwang Claws and twist his arm back, forcing him into a submissive position.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alright, we better calm-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Kill! KIIILL!&#x201D; Screeching, he tears himself away from your grip forcefully. Your instinct, as honed by Master Zhang, was to lock down if your opponent resisted, and that is just what you do.<br>
<br>
There is a wet, ripping noise. His shoulder gives way, the forces driving his body stronger than the flesh that constitutes it. You are left holding a twitching arm, your fingers stained with blood. The audience roars in horror, some of them cursing loudly, Pang Xiaohu letting out a laugh of amazement.<br>
<br>
Fu Xia is crouched down on the ground, but it is not a posture of surrender. He pushes off with his hand and feet, pouncing at you again. It seems that the loss of his arm has not perturbed him one bit. He is not shocked nor does he seem to be in any extra pain from it. Just what did Qilin&#x2019;s medicine do to him?<br>
<br>
Backing away from his attack with a quick hop, you retaliate, swinging hard. You bludgeon him over the head with his own arm, knocking Fu Xia to the ground. He rolls to his feet instantly, panting &#x2013; his face is already pale from the blood loss, but his violent urge to kill is undiminished. Shaking your head, you toss his arm aside. If you cannot subdue him, then you would just have to kill him. You breathe in deeply and take a stance. From this distance it would take only one move to twist his head off. The entire hall is silenced as your killing intent is made clear. Even the insane Fu Xia falters for a moment, staring blankly at you.<br>
<br>
Before you can move, however, the situation changes.<br>
<br>
More blood pours from Fu Xia&#x2019;s eyes, ears, nose and mouth, an unending stream that soaks his clothes and turns them dark. A deep crack appears from where the needle is still embedded, travelling downwards and splitting his skin down the middle. The needle drops out. He sinks to his knees and collapses. You approach him cautiously, stepping around the widening pool of blood.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;I don&#x2019;t&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t want to die&#x2026;&#x201D; wheezes Fu Xia, his eyes unfocused and staring in different directions. His breathing is growing faint. His flesh appears to be melting&#x2026; skin and fat and muscle congealing and falling off his bones. Already his nose is no more, leaving behind a raw, red cavity in the center of his face. Just <i>what </i>did that drug do? Your gaze darts towards Qilin, but she looks just as confused and horrified as you are.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fu Xia! Who ordered you to do this?&#x201D; shouts Jiang Zheng, shaken by what he has just witnessed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Chief&#x2026; I didn&#x2019;t mean to&#x2026; they made me&#x2026; threatened&#x2026; autumn&#x2026; I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D; Tears are welling up in his eyes, mixing with the blood. His tongue is beginning to fall apart, garbling his speech. Gasping loudly, Fu Xia manages to croaks out a single word.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Zhang&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He breathes his last, the gurgle in his throat petering out into a slow, painful rattle that gradually fades into silence.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Zhang?&#x201D; The lieutenant exclaims the name loudly and stares at you, his expression nervous. &#x201C;Does he mean Zhang Jue?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nah, looks like there&#x2019;s only one bunch of bastards it can be. Old Master Du was my father&#x2019;s sworn brother, you know,&#x201D; says the Little Tiger. &#x201C;As good as my own uncle, that&#x2019;s how I thought of him. Not short for enemies, of course, but given what&#x2019;s going on here&#x2026; looks like it was probably them.&#x201D; He grins at the garrison commander. &#x201C;Your Emperor is going to have a tough time of this, eh? Go back and tell him that if he is going to have more important things to do than to trouble us poor bandits who are just trying to make a living down here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The commander frowns, and glances at Jiang. &#x201C;Can you tell me what he is talking about, Chief Jiang?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Jiang Zheng looks at Pang coldly, exuding dignity even in his shackles. &#x201C;This&#x2026; I am not at liberty to say, commander. It is not information I am permitted to share. But for now, everything is over.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As Xiaofang was in no condition to be moved, the remaining constables and you remained in Youxia until Cao&#x2019;er could heal him. The city was gradually returning to normal despite the shock of Du Yao&#x2019;s death; after that gruesome show in court, the lieutenants had decided that it was a very, very good reason for them to keep their heads down and attempt to keep things going the way they were. They had agreed to rule by committee and to uphold Youxia&#x2019;s neutrality, though you did not have much interaction with them before this and could not really care less as to what they decided. Pang Xiaohu and his bandits had left as soon as the trial concluded, their motives here still an enigma. Everyone seems to think that it was for the best. The garrison commander too packed up the camp of three thousand men to return to the fort. Chief Jiang had spoken with him, convincing the commander not to file a report on what he had witnessed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He was not saying autumn. He was referring to his younger sister, Fu Qiu,&#x201D; says Jiang.  &#x201C;I should have known.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is it that you are not telling me, Chief Jiang? Between you and Xiaofang&#x2019;s actions, it seems that this investigation would have gone a lot more easily had you been frank with me from the start,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;It did not have to end this way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
When Xiaofang woke up, he had confirmed that Fu Xia was the one who attacked him. You also found out that Yunzi was the one who rescued him, and that they were attacked again later that night while they were on their way to the sickhouse, though the mysterious assailant was beaten off easily by Armaiti. Xiaofang had refused to be forthcoming about the reason for his tardiness in meeting up with the chief, however. On Jiang&#x2019;s part, he did not seem inclined to pursue that question for now. You wonder what he is hiding. His face is weary, his eyes sunken; the events of the past week seem to have taken a heavy toll on him, particularly after news came that the Jinkong Sect had been massacred almost to a man by the Black Dragon Society. It seems that they were rumoured to have stolen the Xiaoming Jiuyang manual, and the Hei brothers had descended upon the small sect to investigate that rumour forcefully.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I cannot tell you anything just yet,&#x201D; he repeats, the same words that he has been using to deflect the questions. This time, however, he adds, &#x201C;I have my own investigation to run now, and it would be better if you did not know of it. This will take some time. Besides, you should already have the clue in your hands.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Zhang?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A political matter, if there was ever one. I would tread carefully, especially since it is related to the manual. Of course, whoever you are thinking of may have links to people that are easier for you to approach. My advice is to stay away from eunuchs and nobility as much as you can, Xu Jing. You are not too well suited for that field, judging from what just happened,&#x201D; he says quietly, sipping his tea.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not our fault,&#x201D; pouts Qilin. &#x201C;I did expect the unexpected, but <i>that </i>was beyond any expectations of mine. That should not have happened! I&#x2019;ve never messed up so badly!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Something else in Fu Xia&#x2019;s body reacted poorly with your medicine, perhaps?&#x201D; suggests Lady Suien, who has been quietly reading her books all this while.<br>
<br>
Qilin perks up. &#x201C;That&#x2026; that could be a possible explanation! I&#x2019;m going to have to investigate this drug further&#x2026; You&#x2019;re a genius, sister!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Lady Suien ignores her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Anyway,&#x201D; coughs Jiang, &#x201C;we should be returning to Chang&#x2019;an as soon as possible. What will you do, Xu Jing? I think it best if you operate in the field for now, following your own nose. I will likely be stuck behind a desk for a good long time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You ponder his words while taking a bite of the long-awaited duck.<br>
<br>
It is every bit as good as you expected it to be.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will return to Chang&#x2019;an. If your suspicions are correct, you will want to pay a visit to Bai Jiutian in the night and have a little private chat with him. If he is involved with this, it is better that you confirm it quickly; if he is not, then he might become a useful partner thanks to his status in Huashan.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You head towards Wudang. Wang Zhengchong may not be there anymore, but you think you should meet up with Guo Fu and see if there is anything he can tell you. Xuezi also still seems to be keen on visiting the place.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You head for Xiangyang and the Black Dragon Society. If they are also searching for the manuals, they might have some leads that could be useful to you. Besides, your return visit to the place is long overdue; you have some unfinished business with the Hei brothers.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Not long after you exit the city gates, you see two people in turbans waiting for you by the roadside.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;R-r-right, what a coincidence!&#x201D; stammers one of them, &#x201C;Since we just bumped into each other here, it&apos;s a good opportunity to talk. We&#x2019;ve been thinking-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>You </i>have been thinking, Holy Maiden.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t push this on me, Armaiti! A-anyway, I heard about what happened in court. Ultimately, it&#x2019;s about those manuals, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod. &#x201C;What have you heard about them?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not a lot, but if you&#x2019;re looking for the manuals to help us out, then we should&#x2026;&#x201D; She falters, unable to continue.<br>
<br>
Armaiti sighs loudly, seemingly frustrated at Yunzi&#x2019;s inability to finish a sentence. &#x201C;Swallow your pride, Holy Maiden. You want to help with the search, right? Well, uh&#x2026; Lord?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to call me that if you don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201D; You feel that your other companions are observing you keenly for some reason.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll just call you Xu Jing, then,&#x201D; she says without hesitation. &#x201C;So, how about it? You call the shots around here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi is glaring at you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You have them come along. The more people the merrier, you suppose, though you think you&#x2019;ll be leading a small army of girls before the year is out at this rate.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&#x2019;t have them come along. It&#x2019;s better to spread out and cover more ground that way. Besides, you might be going into some dangerous situations.<br>
<br>

            <h3>三十二 · Night on Mount Hua</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Night on Mount Hua</span></b><br>
<br>
Mount Hua is known for its beautiful, towering peaks and some of the most breathtaking, majestic views in the country. At night, however, that only translates to treacherously narrow paths that could lead to deadly drops of a thousand feet, and the darkness would prevent you from even getting to admire the scenery as you fall. With that in mind, the main buildings of the Huashan Sect were built not too far from the main trails leading up the mountain. Though the sect had begun from a small, austere group of Taoist practitioners living on the rather less hospitable peaks of Mount Hua in tiny, threadbare huts, nowadays they would prefer to present a more comfortable image to the people.<br>
<br>
After all, would you host personages such as one of the Grand Eunuchs, or the Chief Secretary of the Great Tang Empire, in a small, rickety shack?<br>
<br>
You grit your teeth as the cold, biting wind picks up. Your fingers dig into the brick as much as you can &#x2013; clinging to the side of a wall, precipitious drop below your feet, you peek over the wall and into the compound. You are pleased to find that this side of the walls were more lightly patrolled thanks to the difficulty of the approach. There are a few disciples going about their duty as night guards, their lanterns burning dimly in the dark. You flip your body over the wall with ease. Then, you feel a sneeze coming on. Scrunching your nose up, you resist it with all your might. The urge passes. You wonder if someone is talking about you behind your back, and suddenly remember &#x2013; with no small amount of dread &#x2013; that Qilin and the other girls were apparently getting together for a long talk tonight.<br>
<br>
You just hope that you will return to an inn that is still standing.<br>
<br>
Crawling up onto a roof and laying yourself flat on the tiles, you observe the layout of the Huashan Sect. There is the temple, their practice grounds, the main hall&#x2026; looking more closely at the people patrolling the living quarters, you manage to identify how the male and female quarters are segregated. Unless Bai Jiutian is indulging in some ungentlemanly activity with the female disciples, you should be able to find him in the male quarters. Well, he <i>could</i> be indulging himself with the male disciples, but you are not one to judge &#x2013; that only means searching for him in the male section is still your best bet. The lower-ranking disciples would be sleeping in the communal quarters, but as the pride and joy of Huashan, he would likely have a room of his own. All that is left is for you is to find it.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The candles are still lighted when you find Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s room. You push the window open in a slow, controlled manner, and the fire burning atop the wax flickers for just a moment. A pleasant fragrance wafts out towards you: those are probably scented candles that he is using. His room is rather large; the bed is separated from the rest of the room by a folding screen that also hides a bathtub. There are sounds of talking coming from within &#x2013; murmurs and whispers that you cannot make out clearly. Bai does not seem to have noticed the brief flickering, engrossed as he is in his conversation. Carefully, quietly, you step over the windowsill and into his room.<br>
<br>
As there is no place to hide, you lie down in the bathtub, waiting for his conversation to conclude. You focus, trying to pick up as much as you can while suppressing your presence at the same time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;is not happy. Manxing has been poorly since Qingcheng, and shows no signs of recovery. Both Manlou and your <i>shidi</i> blames you for it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It is a woman speaking. You keep your surprise to yourself for now, and continue listening.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I did not do anything, <i>shimu</i>!&#x201D; protests Bai Jiutian.<br>
<br>
<i>Shimu</i>? There is only one person who could be called that in Huashan: Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s wife. Certainly, no married lady would be caught dead in another man&#x2019;s room at such hours. Or more precisely, should, but you know all too well that has never stopped anyone if the passion is there.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know you did not, Tian&#x2019;er,&#x201D; says the woman affectionately, &#x201C;but Manxing is Manlou&#x2019;s favourite sibling. The Chief Secretary expected you to take care of your <i>shidi</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>Shimu</i>&#x2026; you asked me to deal with Manxing if I ever had the chance. I was only-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I <i>know</i> what I asked you to do,&#x201D; she chuckles. &#x201C;Just be smarter about it next time, Tian&#x2019;er. Manlou already thinks that we might have been less than honest with him... he still doesn&apos;t realize how his deadweight younger brother is only dragging his ambitions down. I will deal with that and convince Manlou that I am still on his side, so you just focus on what <i>you </i>need to do. I have enough to do after that mess in Youxia City without you creating more problems for me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;yes, <i>shimu</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, don&#x2019;t make that face. I still adore you, my dear. I picked you up when no one else would&#x2026; I won&#x2019;t abandon you.&#x201D; The woman lets out a pleasant laugh. &#x201C;Here, let me adjust this a bit&#x2026; there.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian lets out a stifled moan before saying, awkwardly, &#x201C;Thank you, <i>shimu</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Tian&#x2019;er, you are still a bit sloppy with your technique at times. Be careful it doesn&#x2019;t come undone. Anyway, I need to check on little Baojun. That will be all for tonight&#x2026; I swear, Wuxing dotes on his precious baby male heir more than his wife at times,&#x201D; she says amusedly.<br>
<br>
There is the sound of cloth moving &#x2013; rustling &#x2013; and then footsteps. You hear Bai Jiutian bidding the lady of the house goodbye. The door closes and he sighs deeply. Then, you hear him approaching the folding screen. As he rounds the corner, you see him silhouetted in the candle light, his hands undoing his sash. It looks like he is about to take a bath, although you are occupying the tub at the moment.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s eyes widen when he sees you lying back in the tub relaxedly, and the beginnings of a high-pitched shriek are choked and killed in his throat before it gets anywhere. He pulls his clothes back together in a hurry, fingers knotting up the sash as fast as he can.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You disappoint me,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;I thought you&#x2019;d be running me through with your sword about-&#x201C; A sudden, screeching noise stops you, and you glance at the bottom of the tub, right below your crotch. A narrow hole has been carved through the metal. When you flick your gaze back towards Bai Jiutian, the sword is already in his hand.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That <i>is </i>fast,&#x201D; you murmur. It looks like he already knows how to project sword <i>qi</i> &#x2013; a couple inches higher and you would be applying for a job with Gao Ying. &#x201C;Really, there was no need to put your clothes back on that quickly. We are all men here, aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>Of course </i>we are all men! Why do you even <i>need</i> to keep saying such things? <i>What are you doing here anyway</i>?&#x201D; he snarls, shaken by your sudden appearance although he manages to keep his voice low enough that it will not attract attention.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Paying my dear friend Bai Jiutian a visit,&#x201D; you say, as you sprawl back in the tub. &#x201C;I was surprised at what I discovered, though. Does your master know that his wife visits his best disciple in the middle of the night?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop your baseless slander. My relationship with <i>shimu</i> is not like that,&#x201D; he replies. &#x201C;She is like a mother to me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;you <i>do </i>know that makes it sound even worse, right? <i>Tian&apos;er</i>?&#x201D; You adopt a sweetly tone, mocking him. He does not respond well.<br>
<br>
Laughing, you leap out of the bathtub just in the nick of time, backing up against the window just as a red-faced Bai Jiutian splits the tub apart with a swing of his sword.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Whoa, careful there,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;Look, you can&#x2019;t blame me for wanting some payback, after you sent Zhang Manxing after me, can you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I apologize for that, but I was expecting you to kill him. Isn&#x2019;t he a thorn in both our sides?&#x201D; He takes a few deep breaths, slowly regaining his calm. The glare in his eyes, however, tell you just how irritated he still is.<br>
<br>
You are not sure if you trust his words entirely just yet. &#x201C;Perhaps, but next time, do your own dirty work, or let me know personally. I&#x2019;m not <i>that </i>fond of you that I&#x2019;d like to play games with you all day.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not playing games here. What did you hear? How much did you hear?&quot; he asks, his sword still pointed at you.<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean, your conversation with your <i>shimu</i>? Don&apos;t worry. Nothing incriminating. If you do not believe me, you are free to try and force the truth out of my lips.&quot; Smiling, you extend your hand towards him, as if inviting him to a fight.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, not here. That would be... troublesome.&quot; Bai shakes his head and sheathes his sword. &#x201C;Very well. In a way, it is a good thing you arrived too. I have some questions for you, Xu Jing. This will save me the time of hunting you down later.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, what a coincidence! I have questions for you too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a grim sigh, he continues, &#x201C;Perfect. I have a place where I train in private, near Huangpu Gorge. It is near the northern peak of Mount Hua.  If you want to speak, meet me there tomorrow at <i>wu</i> hour, alone, and we can talk without being disturbed. I do not want to risk talking to you here, in Huashan, for too long. If you tell anyone else about this...&#x201D; Bai Jiutian ends his sentence on a threatening note; it does not suit his gentlemanly persona well, and you can tell that he is not as composed as he appears to be on the outside.<br>
<br>
Still, it looks like if you want to converse with him, you will have to do it at Huangpu Gorge.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You go to the meeting alone, just as he requested. If anything goes wrong, you do not want anyone else caught up in a fight, and it would be easier for you to take care of yourself if you are alone. Besides, you are confident that he will not try anything stupid.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You go to the meeting but call for some of the girls to come along and hide just in the bushes just in case. You want to talk to him, but you are not eager enough that you would go there without being secretly supported by your companions. You are sure they will be in no danger if they are careful.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You don&#x2019;t go to the meeting &#x2013; you don&#x2019;t trust him. You will let him know upfront that you are not interested in meeting him elsewhere to talk; you can find out what he knows on your own terms.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You tell him that you will go to the meeting, but it is actually a lie on your part. Let him wait at Huangpu Gorge until he realizes that you are really not coming. He deserves no less.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You engage in a duel with him on the spot. Sure, it&#x2019;ll probably wake up the entirety of Huashan, but you&#x2019;re going to end up fighting him one way or another, and you just want to see what he can do at the moment. Perhaps something interesting will happen.<br>
<br>
<b>F. </b> You strip naked and threaten to scream unless he talks to you right here, right now. Something interesting will probably happen.<br>
<br>

            <h3>三十三 · Black and White</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Black and White</span></b><br>
<br>
The pavilion is perched on an outcropping that overlooks the deep ravine of Huangpu Gorge. There is an old hut nearby, barely more than four walls and a roof. Leaving the forest trail, you see Bai Jiutian waiting at the pavilion, his hands clasped behind his back. He seems to have been waiting for a while. Just as you reach the pavilion, he speaks to you without turning around. &#x201C;You are late. The tea is turning cold.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I did some sight-seeing on my way here. It&#x2019;s not everyday you get to enjoy the sights of Huashan,&#x201D; you say unapologetically.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why, did you think I was going to ambush you with some goons in the bushes, and went around hunting for them? You wound my pride.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not my fault it is so big and easy to wound.&#x201D; You do not deny his accusation, however.<br>
<br>
Bai makes a strangled grunt and turns around, staring at you. &#x201C;Your tongue, Xu Jing&#x2026; one day I will cut it out.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, get in line,&#x201D; you laugh, and take your seat without being invited. It looks like he has prepared tea, as he said. There is an empty grid carved into the table &#x2013; it is a <i>weiqi</i> board. Two clay bowls, one filled with black pieces and the other with white, are placed next to the grid.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian sits down opposite you. Noticing your glance at the <i>weiqi </i>grid, he asks, &#x201C;Do you play?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not a lot. You seem to be seriously following the gentlemanly rules of etiquette in entertaining a visitor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just because you have spent your life hanging about hoodlums and uncivilized ruffians does not mean that I should not extend a <i>minimal</i> amount of courtesy to you,&#x201D; he says, showcasing just how much more refined he is compared to you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I appreciate it.&#x201D; You pick up a black piece. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not very good at it, so I&#x2019;ll let you have the white.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian smiles thinly.<br>
<br>
You move first, placing your piece on the lines. &#x201C;You said that you had some questions to ask me. Go ahead.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why did you sneak into Huashan?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Because I missed you, Tian&#x2019;er,&#x201D; you say cheekily. Bai&#x2019;s next move involves a loud clack as he slams the piece down on the table. He did not like that answer. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;I came to ask you some questions, of course. But I can wait until you finish interrogating me. What&#x2019;s next?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Still frowning, he moves on to his next question. &#x201C;What are you planning? Are you also looking for the three legendary manuals?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t everyone?&#x201D; you laugh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How did you defeat Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s bodyguards?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t defeat them. They were so weak that fighting me was a self-defeating act.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wh-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, it&#x2019;s my turn. I came here because I wanted to ask you some things too,&#x201D; you interrupt.<br>
<br>
Frowning, Bai nods and acquiesces to you. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s fair enough.&#x201D; He looks down at the board and smiles. The bastard seems to have prepared a three-pronged strategy to surround your pieces.<br>
<br>
You ignore his brief moment of triumph &#x2013; he hasn&#x2019;t won yet &#x2013; and ask, &#x201C;What is your <i>shimu</i>&#x2019;s relation with the Zhang clan? Are they also searching for the manual?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem to have heard a lot. I cannot tell you how Madam Nie is connected with them. If you want to know, ask her yourself. As for the manual&#x2026; perhaps?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, I suppose you know that they already possess the manual for the Xiaoming Jiuyang Divine Skill, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
At this, his face visibly pales, and he loses control for just a second. &#x201C;They do? How do you know that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Maybe Madam Nie would know, or perhaps you can ask Zhang Manlou yourself. They are really close with Huashan, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The amount of time that it takes for him to reply tells you that this turn of events was certainly unexpected to him. Finally, he says, &#x201C;Why are you telling me this? I&#x2026; I cannot believe you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You sent me Zhang Manxing as a present after all. Clearly you do not care for him or the wishes of the Zhang family. If it makes you feel better to believe that this is my way of making up for failing to kill him&#x2026; well, go ahead!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just because I think he is an interfering little git doesn&#x2019;t mean that I am so foolish as to stand against the family of the Chief Secretary. Master Nie would not approve.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you cared for Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s approval, why did you ask to meet me in private then, away from Huashan? You could just have easily shouted out for help last night.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I could, and if you had not agreed to meet me here I would have. I needed to confirm one matter in private though, something that my <i>shifu </i>or <i>shimu </i>must not find out.&#x201D; The encirclement of your black pieces by his white is solidifying by the moment, as Bai Jiutian deftly plays out his strategy.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can understand not letting Master Nie know, but even the Madam? Oh, is little Tian&#x2019;er growing up and becoming rebellious?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Cease your mockery! If you think I&#x2019;m going to spill everything to you so easily, you are mistaken, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re right. So, what will your next move be?&#x201D; You lift your fingers away from the board, having laid down a single black piece that throws all of his carefully arranged strategy into disarray.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This&#x2026; what? When did you&#x2026;?&#x201D; Bai Jiutian is visibly taken aback, unable to imagine a scenario where he would have lost to you in a thinking gentleman&#x2019;s game. Of course, you had played against Shun as well as Imperial <i>weiqi </i>masters back in your childhood, and though Bai Jiutian was a hard opponent, he was not on the level of old farts who lived and breathed the art. Even so, you weren&#x2019;t actually able to find a way to defeat him on the board &#x2013; your move would likely have the game play out into a draw. You get the feeling that he would consider it as a loss, though.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have to be your enemy,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;You are already making plans to separate yourself from Master Nie and the Zhang clan, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; Judging from the conversation last night, you do suspect that Madam Nie&#x2019;s intentions may not fully align with her husband&#x2019;s interests, but from Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s words, you cannot be sure if he is also distancing himself from Madam Nie. He could have informed her of today&#x2019;s clandestine rendezvous&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is no more need for me to concern myself with Zhang Manxing. He&#x2019;s fallen sick, and probably won&#x2019;t last the year,&#x201D; says Bai Jiutian. &#x201C;And as I said earlier, going against the Zhang family is reserved for fools of the highest order. I will tell you this: you know less about them than you think you do. They are not just a group of influential, rich aristocrats who dabble a bit in martial arts. You are taking them too lightly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, no matter what you say, <i>they </i>certainly don&#x2019;t like you. If they&#x2019;re that dangerous&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;that is right,&#x201D; he admits grudgingly. &#x201C;But that only means I need to find ways to protect myself from them instead of relying solely on my <i>shimu</i>. So, let me return to my questions. What did you find in Tufan? I know you were there. Zhang Manxing reported your presence.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I found myself in trouble.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is nothing new. Are you going to answer me, or do I have to force the truth out of you?&#x201D; He seems serious this time: it looks like this is one question that he definitely wants an answer to. He likely selected this place so that he could fight you uninterrupted, too.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Was this always on the list of things you wanted to do today?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have been a thorn in the side of Madam Nie for a long time now, Xu Jing&#x2026; but I might not pluck out that thorn today, depending on what you say.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What a filial disciple. Why do you insist I found something that would be interesting to you in Tufan anyway? If you don&#x2019;t give me a hint, I can&#x2019;t know what it is that you are looking for.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There was once this Shaolin monk,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;who stole some scriptures from Wudang. Combining the two teachings, he developed a strange technique that granted him great power. There have been many different tellings of the conclusion of his tale, but I believe that near the end, he went west. Does this jog your memory?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look him in the eye and smile. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid it all sounds silly to me. Secret technique? Great power? Have you been reading one too many of those children&#x2019;s adventure books that they sell down in the market?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s expression turns cold and hard. &#x201C;It looks like you aren&#x2019;t going to cooperate. Very well-&#x201C; Before he can finish his sentence, the both of you snap your heads towards the trail that you had come from &#x2013; you had detected a new presence at the same time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201D; calls out Bai Jiutian. The bushes rustle in movement; whoever is there is attempting to get away, but there is a swooping sound of rushing air, and leaves and branches scatter everywhere. Bai has his sword out, striking from a distance. &#x201C;Come out, or I will cut you down with my next attack.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing stumbles out of the bushes, pale and sweaty. Small boils are peppered around his face, and he gives a sickly grin when he sees you and Bai Jiutian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are you doing here, Manxing? You should be nursing your illness back in Huashan,&#x201D; calls out Bai. &#x201C;Whatever possessed you to make the journey here?&#x201D; He seems just as surprised as you are to see Zhang Manxing here: looking at the man&#x2019;s physical condition, it seems to be a wonder he actually made it here without fainting on the way. Either he is a very lucky man, or his constitution is a lot stronger than you gave him credit for. He is very clearly unwell and in pain as he walks towards the two of you, his hands held up in the air.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was wondering if my <i>shixiong </i>was going off to train at Huangpu this week. The twins saw you leave but refused to tell me&#x2026; still, after I got forceful with them for a bit and reminded them just who is supporting their father&#x2019;s leadership of Huashan, they learnt their place.&#x201D; Zhang Manxing gives Bai a dirty leer.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What did you do to them?&#x201D; Bai&#x2019;s voice is calm and controlled, but you can tell that his composure is beginning to slip. &#x201C;You do know that Master Nie will kill you if you harm his daughters.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, they&#x2019;re adopted anyway. What does he care, now that he has a bouncing baby boy to coddle?&#x201D; Zhang says confidently. &#x201C;Besides, he told me I could take them as my wives if I wanted. Make me and him real blood relations, with all the benefits that come with it. Heh. I think he&#x2019;ll allow me to do as I want.&#x201D; He begins laughing, but it is interrupted with a hacking cough. Wiping his mouth, he stares at Bai Jiutian. &#x201C;Wives&#x2026; heh. Well, I know that look on your face, <i>shixiong</i>. You&#x2019;re thinking, didn&#x2019;t the doctors diagnose me as being impotent? Those idiot quacks don&#x2019;t know a thing! How could <i>I </i>be impotent? I just need&#x2026; haha, the proper stimulation. That&#x2019;s all I needed!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I&#x2019;ve heard of that disease before. It&#x2019;s when a man sometimes realizes that he becomes unable to engage in sexual intercourse without having a long, thick, hard object inserted up his ass. My condolences, Zhang Manxing,&#x201D; you say apologetically. &#x201C;I did not know.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shut up!&#x201D; he screams. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not it at all! What nonsense are you talking about? I&#x2019;m talking about beatings! Hitting their smooth skin with my fists! Slapping them! Pulling their hair! I-I&#x2026;&#x201D; He goes into another fit of coughing before composing himself. Amusingly, Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s face is full of disgust. Zhang continues his rant, &#x201C;Anyway&#x2026; Anyway! I found the two of you secretly meeting here. That&#x2019;s all I need to know! Imagine this, Young Master Bai conspiring with Man Tiger Pig. I <i>knew </i>it was so! You were trying to get rid of me back at Qingcheng, weren&#x2019;t you? And then you poisoned me, jealous of my skills when I survived!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian grimaces, but you smile at Zhang Manxing and ask a question you&#x2019;ve asked once before. &#x201C;Did you come alone? Surely you didn&#x2019;t tell anyone else about your suspicions, did you? I mean, you would look so silly if you <i>had </i>done so without first confirming what your <i>shixiong </i>was up to.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course I came alone. What do you think I am, stupid? It would ruin my reputation if I dragged other disciples all the way out here without confirming the rumour with my own eyes first!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; says Bai Jiutian coldly. You can feel the killing intent radiating off of him. His sword appears sharper and more menacing than before&#x2026; in his hands, you see a weapon that can truly <i>cut</i>.<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing appears to sense it too, his pox-marked face blanching. He looks nervously to the sides... you get a sudden feeling that he may have lied about coming alone. You could be wrong, though.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You let Bai Jiutian handle it. He can take care of Zhang Manxing himself this time. You&#x2019;ll just sit back and watch the show. If they injure each other, all the better for you.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You are not about to let him take away the satisfaction of pulverizing Zhang Manxing with your own hands. You tell Bai Jiutian to stand back. This time Zhang is not getting away.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You attack Zhang Manxing together with Bai Jiutian. The two of you launching a simultaneous assault should ensure his death. You can never be too careful with this sneaky creep.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You protect Zhang Manxing from Bai Jiutian. If he gets back to Huashan, he might be able to ruin Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s reputation with his accusations. That would be priceless. Besides, Zhang Manxing is doomed from Qilin&#x2019;s poison anyway. Let him suffer before he dies.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b> You try to convince Bai Jiutian that you should take his <i>shidi</i> alive. Perhaps an interrogation of Zhang Manxing will be revealing.<br>
<br>
<b>F. </b>Run away! This is none of your business, let the Huashan people handle it.<br>
<br>
***<br>

					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Black and White II</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-wait, no, you can&#x2019;t attack me! Do you know who I am? You dare?! Master Nie will hear of this!&#x201D; protests Zhang Manxing.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, he won&apos;t.&quot; Bai Jiutian says coldly.<br>
<br>
Zhang fumbles with his sword, attempting to get it out, and by a stroke of luck he manages to draw it in just the right time and position to block Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s sudden slash.  That does not last, however; with a quick flick of his wrist Bai scores a hit on the back of Zhang&#x2019;s hand, causing him to almost drop his sword in pain. Bai&#x2019;s shining blade swoops down for the kill, but the look in Zhang&#x2019;s eyes changes from fear to one of anger, and he unleashes a strange swordplay in retaliation; at times blazingly fast, and other times painfully slow, all seemingly at random.<br>
<br>
You wait no longer. Placing one hand on your wodao&#x2019;s hilt, you move towards Zhang Manxing. He spots your approach out of the corner of his eye and panics. His movement falters. Before you can strike, Bai Jiutian has already taken advantage of  this loss of concentration. His sword jabs right by Zhang&#x2019;s face, taking off his left ear. Zhang shouts, dropping his sword. He backs away hurriedly, reaching into his clothes to bring out a small pouch &#x2013; you recognize it all too well. Getting hit with that here would be rather unwise. Before he can do anything with it, you use your Kuanglang Step to dart in behind him.<br>
<br>
Then, you draw your sword.<br>
<br>
All it takes is one quick slash.<br>
<br>
Your wodao slices through his wrist smoothly, parting bone and flesh with ease. A brief spurt of blood stains your blade as his disembodied hand &#x2013; still grabbing the pouch tightly &#x2013; drops to the ground. Zhang Manxing can do nothing but cry out in agonized disbelief, but that too is cut short in the next second; without hesitation, Bai Jiutian drives his sword into Zhang&#x2019;s chest.<br>
<br>
It does not penetrate far; you do not think Zhang would not be wearing a protective vest, but as Bai pulls his sword away, the rapidly spreading dark stain on the front of Zhang&#x2019;s clothes is clear for you to see.<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing collapses with his arms folded up under him, his eyes closed.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian takes a deep breath, staring at his fallen fellow disciple. Blinking twice, he turns his eyes towards you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now, shall we continue where we left off?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Persistent, aren&#x2019;t you, even after killing your <i>shidi</i>? Shouldn&apos;t you have other things to worry about?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was barely even a workout thanks to your distraction. Besides, if I let you go here,  there is no telling when I will get this chance again.&#x201D; He raises his blood-stained sword, pointing it at you. &#x201C;Are you more willing to talk now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you going to try and make me talk?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I cannot afford not to. My <i>shimu </i>already suspects a thing or two about you&#x2026; even if you do not talk now, you are merely postponing the inevitable.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The inevitable? What would <i>that </i>be?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A vicious little sneer appears on his lips and he leaps at you without further warning.<br>
<br>
He is fast, definitely faster than you are; in his little scuffle with Zhang Manxing he was not moving anywhere as fast as he is now. His footwork is swift and predatory, constantly circling towards your flanks. His sword is moving at such a way that it weaves silver arcs through the air, creating the impression of multiple blades in motion.  The speed of his steel, however, is deceptive to the eye: you find that out first hand when you block the first slash with your scabbard and suffer shallow cuts to your shoulder and knee not a second later.<br>
<br>
You lash out with your fist, but with a twirl he steps away from it, calling out to you, &#x201C;You are not yet using everything you have, are you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian raises his sword and comes at you again; you realize that if you want to survive his next onslaught you would have to focus. You concentrate, drawing apart <i>yin </i>and <i>yang</i>. Bai&#x2019;s sword streaks through the air, almost invisible, the slashes coming in wild and fast in a sword dance that is at once dazzling and primal. The <i>qi</i> behind his attacks is forceful enough that the pressure from his attacks slice into the ground around you, tearing up soil and cutting down bushes.<br>
<br>
Yet, you meet his attack head on.<br>
<br>
Leaping forward in the form of the Vermillion Phoenix, you attempt to interrupt his attack. Bai adapts, however, expertly deflecting your powerful slashes and countering with swift jabs of his sword.<br>
<br>
You duck under one thrust and stop another with your scabbard. The point of his blade digs into the wood, catching there for a second. Taking the opportunity, you subtly execute the Graceful Dragon Uncoils, almost catching him unawares with a deceptive palm strike. As Bai Jiutian bends backwards to evade your attack, you jump, sending a kick at his head. He brings his arm up to block, and you take advantage of it to push off of him, sending yourself further up into the air. He glares at you, making no move in pursuit.<br>
<br>
You land a safer distance away from him and sheathe your wodao. Giving him a casual smirk, you ask, &#x201C;Do you think I need to use everything I have?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will <i>make </i>you use everything you have. You are not leaving this mountain otherwise, Xu Jing,&#x201D; comes the reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Man Tiger Pig comes and goes like the wind, Tian&#x2019;er. I&#x2019;m not that easy to catch,&#x201D; you laugh, causing the refined Huashan swordsman to scowl.<br>
<br>
Still, you don&#x2019;t feel as confident as you sound. His speed is such that escaping might not be an easier proposition than staying and fighting him. Continuing the fight, too, poses its problems. If it was just a battle of <i>neigong</i>, you might be superior, but you can tell that his swordsmanship is practically flawless; you would have to draw him into a dirty, close-up brawl before you have a chance of hurting him. Not impossible&#x2026; but very risky. There is no telling what other techniques he has up his sleeve either &#x2013; he might still be holding back to see what you can do.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, you <i>could</i> just show him what he wants to see.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You continue to engage Bai Jiutian in battle until either of you is defeated. It does not need to be a duel to the death - though there&apos;s no telling what will happen when two people of your respective skills collide in an uncontrolled fight. This will be a very rare opportunity to test your skills against a pugilist of his caliber.<br>
<ol>
<li>You use Wuxiang Qiankun; it is a good chance to practice the mimicking of someone with greater skill in battle. This could also be a deciding factor in achieving victory.</li>
<li>You don&#x2019;t use Wuxiang Qiankun. This will make your battle considerably harder, but you do not want to risk exposing the skill&#x2019;s existence to him.</li>
</ol><br>
<b>B. </b>You call for a halt to the hostilities. If Bai Jiutian wants to know what you found in Tufan, you&#x2019;ll tell him. Still, perhaps you don&#x2019;t need to tell him the whole truth&#x2026; though he appears to be suspicious enough at the moment that you cannot simply make up whatever lies you want. You&#x2019;ll have to confess a shocking truth.<br>
<ol>
<li>You tell him that you have the Wuxiang Qiankun Skill, but say nothing about where you found it and what happened at the Fire Temple.</li>
<li>You confide in him that you are the new Lord of the Fire Temple, and make no mention of the Wuxiang Qiankun Skill.</li>
</ol><br>
<b>C. </b>You run off. You don&#x2019;t see any purpose in continuing to fight him, and you are rather confident that you should be able to lose him in the forest. Of course, if he catches up to you with your back turned you might be at a disadvantage, but you&#x2019;ll deal with that if it happens.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You ask for a halt to the fighting so that you can ensure Zhang Manxing is buried. He might not trust you enough to graciously stop the fight to let you do so safely, but you are going to try and waltz over to his body anyway to confirm that he is dead.<br>

            <h3>三十五 · Black and White III</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Black and White III</span></b><br>
<br>
Swishing your wodao casually from side to side, you stand carelessly, smirking at Bai Jiutian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are you waiting for?&#x201D; he demands.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m waiting for you to make me use everything I have, like you said. Is your memory failing you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He responds to your flippant remark by lunging forward, his sword held out in front of him in a powerful charge. Narrowing your eyes, you swiftly snap your sword back into its sheath and raise the scabbard in a pinpoint block. The strength of his thrust drives you back several feet, your boots dragging in the ground. As you reach out to grab his sword-arm, he bends it arm and elbows your hand away. Now freed from Bai&#x2019;s blade, you lash out with the wodao&#x2019;s scabbard, aiming for his face. He evades it, leaning back as the wooden sheath passes a mere inch away from his nose. His foot comes up, striking your arm before you can react, and with a quick circular motion, he brings his sword back to the fore, slashing towards your chest.<br>
<br>
With your free hand, you hurriedly gather your <i>qi</i> and push forward in a defensive Xianglong move: The Fierce Dragon Crosses the Great Rivers. The pressure generated from your palm strike slows down his blade before it reaches you, enough that you are able to slip the back of your hand against the flat of his blade and knock it aside with a swift blow. Following up, you attempt to grab him with a Diving Eagle Grip, but with a sudden burst of speed Bai Jiutian darts into the blind spot of your left eye.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re too slow!&#x201D; His sword shines silver as he shouts, launching two consecutive slashes in a cross that force you back and tear up the ground with cutting <i>qi</i>. Having put you on the back foot, Bai presses his advantage with a relentless sword dance that almost outpaces your ability to defend against it. Even though you successfully block or evade his attacks, he is never discomfited &#x2013; his poise remains perfect and he lets slip no glaring errors in his swordplay which you can exploit.<br>
<br>
Of course, Bai Jiutian cannot keep this up forever. As the dance comes to a close, it is your turn to move. His sword slows for just a fraction for a second, signalling the end of the move, and you dart forward. His expression changes ever so slightly as he tries to reverse the direction of his blade to slash at you &#x2013; it arrives, but not so fast that you cannot parry it. Blocking his attack, you draw the wodao in a swift counterattack. The blade leaves the scabbard with a high-pitched ring, arcing towards Bai. His jaw clenched, he throws his body sideways, dodging your slash by a hair&#x2019;s breadth. The sharp edge of your blade trails across the front of his clothes, leaving behind a cut so fine that it is almost invisible.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is some quality silk,&#x201D; you say approvingly. &#x201C;It parts smoothly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll wring the payment out of you, Xu Jing,&#x201D; growls Bai Jiutian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Tally it up after I&#x2019;ve finished cutting your clothes off of you.&#x201D; You go on the offensive, performing the Leaf Dance of the Azure Dragon as you move around him gracefully in a series of quick and precise slashes. He deflects each and every one of your attacks expertly, his brow furrowed in concentration.<br>
<br>
You halt for half a step, seemingly hesitating, and Bai Jiutian grabs that opportunity without thinking. He lunges forward with a quick little slash that would have disarmed you had you not been expecting it. You parry and pull away from his sword, allowing his momentum to carry forward. Making use of it, you spin and throw a Returning Wind Spear at him. He grits his teeth and scowls; this attack of yours is too fast and powerful for him to block cleanly. He kicks off of the ground, avoiding your kick with a jump that propels him high into the sky.<br>
<br>
Just where you want him.<br>
<br>
You give chase; leaping after Bai Jiutian, you take the fight skywards. Your feet cut through the air as you unleash a powerful sequence of kicks at blinding speed &#x2013; the Shadowless Thunder Breaker. This will end it.<br>
<br>
He dodges every single kick effortlessly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wha-&#x201C; Before you can complete your exclamation of surprise, he brings his sword down upon you with a powerful two-handed slash while you are vulnerable. You realize, with a sinking feeling, that the sheer force from this attack will easily cut past your guard even if you block it.<br>
<br>
There is no helping it. You drop the scabbard, letting it hang from your waist, as you quickly mimic his grip.<br>
<br>
His blade swoops downwards, yours rises up.<br>
<br>
The swords clash, edge meeting edge with a high-pitched clang that echoes throughout the gorge.<br>
<br>
When the two of you land, further apart than when you jumped into the air, there is an expression of barely restrained triumph on Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s face. &#x201C;Is that it? Is that what you have been hiding?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You shrug lazily, smiling, and beckon at him with one wagging finger. &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you find out more, to be certain?&#x201D; You can feel your <i>qi </i>already dissolving back into chaos; it will take a short while before you can fully employ Wuxiang Qiankun again.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian raises his sword in a salute and chuckles confidently. Then, he resumes the fight. You cross blades with him, parrying desperately as he speeds up his attacks.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter? Why aren&#x2019;t you using that move again?&#x201D; he calls out, flicking his wrist as his sword snakes past your guard, making a light cut across your forearm.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You need to <i>make </i>me use it, no?&#x201D; you grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As you wish! I&#x2019;ll let you have a taste of Huashan&#x2019;s Zixia Swordplay&#x2026; let&#x2019;s see if you&#x2019;ll continue to be stubborn even then.&#x201D; A powerful swirl of <i>qi </i>&#x2013; almost tangible to the naked eye &#x2013; spirals through Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s sword-arm as he raises the sword in a high stance that is clearly bad news the way Vairya&#x2019;s special stance is. You lower your own stance in response, your right hand hovering above the hilt of the wodao as you dig your feet into the ground.<br>
<br>
With a shout, Bai Jiutian strikes. His sword gleams with a shade of crimson akin to that of clouds at dawn.<br>
<br>
Your hand lightly touches the hilt.<br>
<br>
The red blade swims through the air faster than your eye can follow.<br>
<br>
It is not sight that you need to use now, however.<br>
<br>
You close your eye.<br>
<br>
Your fingers close around the hilt.<br>
<br>
You wait for the last possible moment&#x2026; the moment when your opponent has committed to the attack and will no longer be able to change his trajectory.<br>
<br>
On sheer instinct, at the edge of death, you draw.<br>
<br>
Your wodao leaves its sheath to meet its foe.<br>
<br>
Metal strikes metal. The sound is clear, like the chiming of bells.<br>
<br>
Your fingers give way, the hilt slipping from your grasp as the force of Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s Zixia Swordplay flings the wodao away.<br>
<br>
But you are already moving forward.<br>
<br>
Your eye snaps open.<br>
<br>
As Bai Jiutian prepares his follow-up attack, your left hand has already plunged into the front of your robes. With a flick of your wrist, you pull the Yuchang Sword from its hiding place. Your pace becomes faster &#x2013; more predatory &#x2013; as you return to Bai Jiutian his Huashan sword dance.<br>
<br>
Taken by surprise, he barely has the time to return to a defensive position. Still, this is his technique&#x2013; he knows it well enough to read your next moves. You take the next step before he has fully recovered. The flow of your <i>qi </i>begins to surge forth into the Yuchang Sword as you raise it high, the blade gleaming red.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A gift for a gift. Here, have this back!&#x201D; you shout.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s eyes widen even though he had surely been expecting this. Your sword plunges towards him at a speed faster and more powerful than any technique you have in your own repertoire.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the look in his eyes changes. The blade of his sword blurs; it seems to sink into a deep shadow as he moves in a way even your Wuxiang Qiankun cannot grasp &#x2013; there seems to be a strange transformation in the flow of his <i>qi</i>, taking a soft, imperceptible <i>yin </i>tone. The bastard <i>still </i>had something in reserve.<br>
<br>
You stop your attack, the point of your blade a mild tremor away from nicking his eye. His own sword is held just under your chin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think,&#x201D; he says carefully, eyeing your sword, &#x201C;we should call a truce for now. Then we can talk about this like gentlemen.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I agree. We can do that the moment you lower your sword. Be a good boy now, Tian&#x2019;er.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think so. <i>You</i> should be the one to put your sword away first.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to argue with you about this. Alright, we&#x2019;ll do it at the same time. On the count of three?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Agreed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The count reaches three, but neither of you budge.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t be trusted, can you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The same goes for you. Alright, let&#x2019;s try this again.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It still doesn&#x2019;t work.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You really should cooperate. My arm is getting tired. I might poke out your eye.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I might give you a very close shave.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You hear a shuffling movement. Turning your head slightly, you spot Zhang Manxing crawling away out of the corner of your eye. He has the vitality of a cockroach, it seems. He raises his head slowly, turning around to look at you.<br>
<br>
His gaze meets yours and Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s, and he freezes up.<br>
<br>
You move your sword away, nodding at Bai.<br>
<br>
He breaks away from you without a word, his attention now turned towards Zhang Manxing. With a desperate shout, Zhang tries to make a break for it, scrambling to his knees and pushing off the ground with his one good arm. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you! I swear, I&#x2019;ll kill you! I&#x2019;ll get my brother to violate and destroy everything you hold dear!&#x201D; screams Zhang in a mix of anger and fear. He does not get far before Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s sword is buried in his back, piercing clean through his body.<br>
<br>
Zhang stumbles forward, screaming, before Bai can remove the sword. As he goes after his <i>shidi </i>to retrieve the blade, a cloud of thick yellow mist greets him. It looks like that pouch wasn&#x2019;t the only surprise Zhang kept on him. Crying out, Bai Jiutian strikes at Zhang reflexively, pushing him away.<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing slips, totters on a rock, and falls, plunging down into the depths of the gorge. Hopefully, that is the last you see of the bastard&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How are you feeling?&#x201D; you call out cautiously as you edge towards Bai Jiutian. The mist has cleared quickly, leaving him prone on the ground. If it is what you think it is, you can&#x2019;t really do anything for him anyway. You wouldn&#x2019;t want to, to be honest.<br>
<br>
As you draw closer, you see Bai Jiutian clawing at the ground with his fingers. He is breathing heavily, his face flushed. &#x201C;Go away!&#x201D; he screams, his voice cracking.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you know what you just breathed in?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He does not reply, glaring up at you.<br>
<br>
A second later, his eyes roll up in his head as the effects of the drug prove too much to bear &#x2013; this appears to be a lot more potent than what Song Lingshu had endured. Bai Jiutian falls unconscious, beads of sweat lining his face. You go in a little closer and nudge him with the tip of your boot. He&#x2019;s still out like a brick. Kneeling down, you take his pulse. Your initial guess was right &#x2013; the drug was a lot more concentrated this time. It is beyond your skill to stabilize with any treatment other than the easiest way, and you do not have time to move him anywhere.<br>
<br>
Then, something perplexing happens.<br>
<br>
His face changes &#x2013; you recognize the technique, having seen it once before in Guizhou; it is the Wudu Cult&#x2019;s acupuncture disguise. The shift in his features is subtle but pronounced, his brows growing more delicate, his jaw less pronounced, and even his stature appearing to shrink slightly as his shoulders narrow.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Whoa,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s eyes open again, consciousness returning slowly; the gaze of those eyes is clouded as thin, elegant fingers clutch at your leg, tightening their grip. The only sounds in the gorge are of the swift flowing river below, and a heavy panting.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>There is no choice. You&#x2019;ll have to cure Bai Jiutian the old-fashioned way. You might be hated for this, but it is a risk you are willing to bear.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You can&#x2019;t bring yourself to do this; Bai Jiutian&apos;s fate is really none of your concern anyway. You leave and flee down the mountain.

            <h3>三十六 · White End</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">White End</span></b><br>
<br>
By the time the sun drops below the horizon and night falls outside the hut, you are already very thoroughly certain that Bai Jiutian is not a man. She is huddled in the opposite corner across from you, an old blanket wrapped tightly around herself, her hair disheveled and undone from the exertions of the day. You had tried to be as gentle as possible, but the both of you had still ended up putting a few holes in the thin wooden walls of the hut. Thankfully there was no one around to listen but the birds in the trees. Sniffling and red-eyed, she glares at you, murmuring curses under her breath.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you tell anyone about this, I will kill you,&#x201D; says Bai Jiutian coldly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I thought you would kill me anyway,&#x201D; you reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is done is done,&#x201D; she spits out bitterly. &#x201C;I will just have to consider it my bad luck that I was saved and despoiled at the same time.&#x201D; Bai shifts her body under the blanket as a blush creeps up her cheeks; for just an instant, it parts slightly, and you see a glimpse of pale skin. Your gaze moves away guiltily, unbidden memories returning to your mind. Strangely, part of you still remains unsatisfied; you wonder if it is the lingering effects of the drug.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There are more important things for me to focus on than my&#x2026; my chastity,&#x201D; she continues haltingly &#x2013; you can see the barely restrained turmoil in her eyes. She is definitely more affected by what just happened than she tries to show... it must be taking a superhuman effort of will to hold back all of the conflicting emotions within her at this moment, and to focus on what she thinks is more important.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There will be trouble between Huashan and the Zhang clan after this thanks to Zhang Manxing. Now that we are working together, I hope you do not mind when I name you responsible for his death,&quot; says Bai Jiutian without batting an eye.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have guts, saying it to my face like that. When did I agree to work together with you?&#x201D; you laugh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It benefits me more than it disadvantages you. Your reputation is already terrible in the eyes of the orthodox world anyway. Trust me, Xu Jing, you have no better choice in this matter. This will work out... for us both.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You would set the Zhang clan after me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They already have you in their sights. I would just hasten the timetable. &#x2026;besides, you have to take responsibility for what you did to me.&#x201D; She finishes her sentence quietly, looking down at the ground.<br>
<br>
It is a very strange way of taking responsibility, you think. This is no different from blackmail. It is strange that she is stating her intentions outright &#x2013; perhaps she intends for you to reason with her? Now that you have healed her, however, you do not have any realistic way of making Bai Jiutian listen to you by force&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You attempt to convince Bai Jiutian to refrain from fingering you as the culprit. You cannot afford to make further enemies of them. There has to be a better way.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You allow Bai Jiutian to name you as the culprit. It would not make a difference anyway if the Zhang clan is already after you. Drawing their suspicion away from Bai would probably allow her to operate more easily too.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You offer to teach Bai Jiutian the basics of Wuxiang Qiankun in return for some tutelage in sword techniques, trading knowledge for knowledge. Perhaps this will strengthen your alliance.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You offer to teach Bai Jiutian the wrong basics of Wuxiang Qiankun, sabotaging the teachings so that she might hurt herself when practicing it, while asking for some tutelage in swords in bad faith.<br>
<br>
<b>3. </b>You don&#x2019;t make any such offer. What will be will be.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Qilin is the only person that greets you when you return to the inn in Chang&#x2019;an early next morning. Still tired from your trip down Huashan, you drop onto the chair and rest your head on the table. &#x201C;Where are the others?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They&#x2019;re still sleeping soundly, tired from a little conversation session we had last night,&#x201D; says Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really? What was it about?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, wouldn&#x2019;t you like to know?&#x201D; She smiles mischieviously, and says, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s for girls only, so you <i>don&apos;t</i> need to know, dear. Anyway, while you were away, we had two messages coming in. One is from Chief Jiang, and the other is from Master Qi.&#x201D; Qilin recites the messages to you from memory, and you listen intently.<br>
<br>
Chief Jiang&#x2019;s message contains a brief update on his investigations: he seems certain that the Zhang family are ultimately behind the incident in Youxia City, and has extended a suggestion that you should leave Chang&#x2019;an as soon as possible in a bid to draw the Zhang family&#x2019;s attention away so that he can investigate even more deeply.<br>
<br>
Qi Liuwu, on the other hand, conveys worse news; it seems that he is now on the run from the Beggar&#x2019;s Sect. His former sect members had attacked him with the intent to capture or kill, but thanks to the Wuying Leipo Kick you taught him, the old beggar had managed to fight his way out of Chang&#x2019;an, and was now headed to the east. He says that he will meet up with you in Yangzhou, just before the Conference of Swords is scheduled to be held.<br>
<br>
You sigh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, one more thing,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;We encountered that monk, Xuxian, while you were up on the mountain. He was on the run from some goons of Zhang Manlou, and we hid him for a while.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is he doing back here?&#x201D; you ask, puzzled. He is probably one of the most wanted pugilists in the <i>jianghu </i>at the moment thanks to what happened at Shaolin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He claims that his teacher instructed him to return to Shaolin Temple and repent for his wrongdoings. It looks like he is genuinely making his way there to beg for forgiveness.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You wonder if it is going to end well&#x2026; you suspect that the monks of Shaolin might not be as free with forgiveness now that Abbot Fangzhang is no more.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;By the way, darling?&#x201D; Qilin&#x2019;s tone of voice is strangely sweet.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-yes? What is it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did anything happen while you were up on Huashan?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why do you ask?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I just thought I smelt something on you&#x2026; no matter. Even if you don&#x2019;t tell me now, I&#x2019;ll slowly and lovingly squeeze the truth from you tonight,&#x201D; she smiles.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You head east by way of Luoyang, heading towards Shaolin Temple. You might be able to catch up with Xuxian before he arrives at the temple; you would like to speak to him and perhaps offer him safe escort to Shaolin, if needed.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You head east by way of Wudang and Xiangyang. You would like to visit Wudang and check out the situation there, unwelcome as you may be... you wonder how Guo Fu is doing right now.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
On the way there, you will continue your practice of martial arts. Pick two:<br>
<br>
I. You learn the animal-taming technique, Wudu Fushun, from Qilin. It might be good to have some animal servants in the future.<br>
<br>
II. You learn a form of neigong from Qilin - while your streams are separated, you can allow your qi to take on a poisonous nature: Liedu Zhuanhua Skill (&#x70C8;&#x6BD2;&#x8F49;&#x5316;&#x529F;, Fierce Poison Transformation Skill), the Wudu Cult&apos;s basic neigong skill. It transforms the user&apos;s qi into one of a poisonous nature, allowing them to inflict crippling pain upon an opponent even when unarmed. It can also absorb all toxins, turning them into temporary fuel to strengthen the neigong of the practitioner, though at a cost of weakening the body in the long-term if overused.<br>
<br>
III. You learn the Yuhe Finger from Cao&#x2019;er. Now that you can manipulate your qi, you will be able to use it to heal others.<br>
<br>
IV. You learn the Qingcheng Stab from Yifang, incorporating it into your self-taught technique with the Yuchang Sword. As her skill with it is perfect, watching her demonstration will likely gain you a perfect understanding of the technique.<br>
<br>
V. You learn the Guihe Formation from Yifang, asking her to demonstrate the possible variations for all six members to you until you have memorized it all and are able to execute it by yourself.<br>
<br>
VI. You learn the Qingzi Sword (&#x9752;&#x5B57;&#x528D;, Green Letter Sword) from Song Lingshu, a swift swordplay that is heavily focused on offense; it is said to be one of the quickest sword techniques in the jianghu. Designed to be used in conjunction with the Chengzi Step to form the Qingcheng Sect&apos;s famous Qingcheng Jianwu combination technique.<br>
<br>
VII. You learn the Chengzi Step (&#x57CE;&#x5B57;&#x821E;, City Letter Step) from Song Lingshu, a defensive qinggong geared towards evading the attack patterns made by weapons, particularly those from the orthodox sects. Designed to be used in conjunction with the Qingzi Sword to form the Qingcheng Sect&apos;s famous Qingcheng Jianwu combination technique.<br>
<br>
VIII. You learn the Liushen Shanshen Great Skill (&#x516D;&#x8056;&#x5584;&#x795E;&#x5927;&#x6CD5;, Spenta Ormazd Great Skill), from Yunzi and Armaiti &#x2013; this is the characteristic fiery <i>neigong </i>of the Fire Temple. Your <i>qi</i> will take on the characteristics of fire, augmenting the damage done by your attacks and burning your enemies.<br>
<br>
IX. You learn the Dingdi Step (&#x5B9A;&#x5730;&#x6B65;, Earth-Stabilizing Step) from Armaiti, a technique that allows you to remain in an extremely stable, grounded stance while not losing an ounce of your usual speed. It will increase your defensive ability greatly when employed.<br>
<br>
X. You meditate on Wuxiang Qiankun, attempting to advance your knowledge of the technique to a higher level now that you have had more practical experience with it in a real fight.<br>
<br>
XI. You meditate on Wuxiang Qiankun with Xuezi&#x2019;s help, allowing her insights to guide your development of the technique in a different direction than you would have on your own.<br>

            <h3>三十七 · Two Road-Side Meetings</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Two Road-Side Meetings</span></b><br>
<br>
You are on the road again. A lone man travelling with seven girls would attract no end of attention, and as such they have tried to disguise themselves to the best of their ability. With Qilin&#x2019;s help, Yunzi, Armaiti and Lingshu could almost pass for men from a distance, but there was no helping the others. Still, no matter how you tried to hide it, a skilled master would be able to discern that something was off. You wonder just how Bai Jiutian had kept up the ruse for so long and so close to so many other master pugilists.<br>
<br>
And just as you thought about it, you spotted her waiting for you and your entourage by the side of the deserted country road.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Young Master Bai?&#x201D; Song Lingshu&#x2019;s voice is awkward and hesitant &#x2013; what happened back at Qingcheng may still weigh on her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Miss Song, it is a pleasure to see you today,&#x201D; Bai nods, in full gentleman mode. Her disguise is indeed impeccable. She holds up one hand and says, &#x201C;I am not here to pick a fight. I merely have something to discuss with Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure about this?&#x201D; whispers Yunzi as you make to dismount the carriage.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ve got it all under control.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Hopping off, you walk towards Bai Jiutian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alright, what is it, Tian&#x2019;er?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She scowls. &#x201C;Do not call me by that name again. Out of the kindness of my heart, I have decided to share some information with you. Bear this in mind as you head east.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You bob your head, waiting for her to continue.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I found no trace of Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s body at the bottom of the gorge, although I did manage to retrieve my sword. I reported that the both of you fell off in your battle and went missing. It would not do for him to reappear alive if I had previously confirmed him dead, so&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I understand. The Zhang family might still come after me to find out where Manxing is instead, if he doesn&#x2019;t return to them,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;We did agree on this, after all. I can have no complaints.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If he does return to them this deal will be the least of our problems, but I suspect it will not be that easy. That part of Mount Hua is treacherous and there are rumours a great beast has moved in recently. He should not be that blessed by the gods. Besides that, I have influenced certain people to begin talking about Zhang Manxing. Bad-mouthing the dead might not be a very honourable thing to do, but I do not think he deserves any. Furthermore, as much as Zhang Manlou cares for his brother, he and his family are a little more concerned with finding the manuals at the moment.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How is <i>that </i>going, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I discussed the matter with my <i>shimu</i>. Besides the fragment of the Jiuyin manual that I copied from under their noses, they should not have any of the full books yet.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your <i>shimu </i>could be lying to you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She could be,&#x201D; says Bai, and the tone in her voice warns you not to go any further with this line of conversation. It appears to be a rather sensitive issue to her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you done yet, darling?&#x201D; calls out Qilin impatiently from the driver&#x2019;s seat.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just a second!&#x201D; you respond.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian shakes her head, clucking her tongue. &#x201C;A grown man travelling the country with seven women. You are truly a scoundrel, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course,&#x201D; you smile, and clasp her hand tightly, twining your fingers with hers. &#x201C;Good luck, Jiutian-<i>xiong</i>. I&#x2019;ll let you know what I find out east.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She is stunned for a moment. Then, with a sudden shout, Bai wrenches her hand away and slaps you across the cheek. &#x201C;Y-y-you reprobate! This is no way for a gentleman to behave! I&#x2019;ll remember this!&#x201D; she shouts, storming away red-faced.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He acts just like you, Yunzi,&#x201D; laughs Qilin when you return to the carriage, the side of your face smarting from Bai&apos;s slap.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What? I don&#x2019;t behave like that at all!&#x201D; replies Yunzi indignantly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh&#x2026; could Xu Jing and Young Master Bai actually be&#x2026;&#x201D; Lingshu seems lost in her own thoughts, on the other hand, a blush creeping into her cheeks.<br>
<br>
Shaking your head, you carry on, travelling towards the east.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You track down Xuxian&#x2019;s path easily: the former Shaolin monk had been moving in a straightforward route from town to town, always towards the temple. It looks like he had been pursued all the way too, but he had constantly managed to defeat his pursuers, leaving them battered but not dead, and ready for another attempt.<br>
<br>
Of course, he also left them behind in your path&#x2026; and you were not anywhere near as merciful when they recognized and attacked you. In this way, you mopped up those after him step by step, without his knowledge.<br>
<br>
Soon, you narrow the distance to just a village; you should be able to catch up with Xuxian just before he enters Luoyang.<br>
<br>
Giving the horses and the carriage a rest, you take a break at a road-side inn. Your martial arts practice has been going well, and the girls are also improving steadily, no thanks in part to the fights they&#x2019;ve been involved in on the way here.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Excuse me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Someone interrupts your meal. Looking up, you see a couple in their mid-thirties. They are well-dressed, with refined looks. The man is dashing and the woman elegant.<br>
<br>
They also appear to be people of the <i>jianghu</i> &#x2013; their posture tells you that they bear no small measure of skill, and they are bearing swords.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;May I help you?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was just wondering, my good sir &#x2013; you are Xu Jing, the Man Tiger Pig, are you not?&#x201D; asks the man.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got the wrong person,&#x201D; you smile.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid not. Though the description we were given was of a one-eyed youth travelling with seven girls, and there do not seem to be <i>seven </i>girls here&#x2026; I think we have still found the right person,&#x201D; says the woman.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am sure I know myself better than you do, sir. I am not Xu Jing,&#x201D; you repeat. It would be easier to avoid trouble if possible, and you sense that what is coming up next is nothing but trouble.<br>
<br>
Of course, you also know that it is not going to be so easy. &#x201C;Perhaps before you demand my identity, you should introduce yourself,&#x201D; you shoot back.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My apologies,&#x201D; the man bows. &#x201C;I am Zuo Qingfeng, and this is my wife, You Lanhai.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is a pleasure to meet you,&#x201D; the woman says as she too bows in greeting.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is unfortunate that our paths are to cross in such a manner, Xu Jing, but I am afraid I must take your head with me,&#x201D; says Zuo Qingfeng.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Only if you are sure you have the right head,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;Even so, why are you so keen on taking the head of Xu Jing?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We have our&#x2026; difficulties,&#x201D; says You Lanhai regretfully. &#x201C;We only have business with you&#x2026; please ask your friends to stay out of this if they do not want to get hurt.&#x201D; She casts an imploring look at Yunzi, who seems to be preparing for a fight.<br>
<br>
Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai&#x2026; the names of these two are known to you; the swords at their side must be the famous twin swords, Gan Jiang and Mo Ye. You have heard that they were living in seclusion, far from the troubles of the <i>jianghu</i>, and wonder just why they are attempting to kill you all of a sudden, but it looks like you will not be able to find out any more with just words. Their killing intent is becoming clear; you think you would be able to draw more information out of them in a fight... if you would risk it.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er tugs at your sleeve and nods. She seems prepared to hurl some needles at the couple.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You accept the request for a duel; you will bring this outside and take them on by yourself. They are after you alone, and you are also somewhat confident you can at least match them without any assistance.<br>
<ol>
<li>You take the opportunity to practice your Wuxiang Qiankun alone against a duo known for fighting in tandem.</li>
<li>You don&#x2019;t use Wuxiang Qiankun; you don&#x2019;t think you need to.</li>
</ol><b>B. </b>You accept the request for a duel but ask to fight in pairs &#x2013; it is only fair. You pick one of the girls to fight with you. Seeing the sword-using couple, you&#x2019;re feeling tempted to try having someone close by your side during a fight too.<br>
<ol>
<li>Qilin</li>
<li>Cao&#x2019;er</li>
<li>Yifang</li>
<li>Song Lingshu</li>
<li>Xuezi</li>
<li>Yunzi</li>
<li>Armaiti</li>
</ol><b>C. </b>You have Cao&#x2019;er throw the needles at them to create a distraction and attempt to take them down inside the inn itself. You don&#x2019;t feel like fighting fairly here; you&#x2019;ll just have to defeat them as quickly as possible with whatever means you have.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You have Cao&#x2019;er throw the needles to create a distraction, and take the chance to make a run for it. They don&#x2019;t seem to be very willing to fight &#x2013; perhaps they will not be so motivated to give chase if you escape them here.

            <h3>三十八 · Dreaming Butterfly</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Dreaming Butterfly</span></b><br>
<br>
You lead Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai to a clearing some distance away from the inn, where you can engage in battle without involving any innocents.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I must confess my surprise, Young Master Xu,&#x201D; says Zuo. &#x201C;I had expected you to begin a fight in the inn itself, disregarding innocent lives.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Come now, do I really have that bad a reputation?&#x201D; you laugh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You do.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How unfortunate. Master Zuo and Madam You must be great pugilists indeed to bravely approach someone with such a terrible reputation.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We have no choice,&#x201D; says You Lanhai, but she does not elaborate on it further.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;By the way, <i>qianbei</i>, I am just curious; are the two of you not married? You have not adopted Master Zuo&#x2019;s surname, madam.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There are&#x2026; circumstances. We are husband and wife in heart and spirit, if not in name,&#x201D; answers Zuo Qingfeng politely. &#x201C;I find it a pleasant surprise that you have been so civil thus far, Young Master Xu, but I am afraid our fight is inevitable.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hold on! Before we begin, I hope that you will grant me a slight favour.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You Lanhai looks at you quizzically. &#x201C;What is it, Young Master Xu?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, I would not like everyone to say that the famous twin swords of love, Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai, bullied someone junior and inferior to them by ganging up on him. Could I ask for one of my friends to fight by my side?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zuo Qingfeng frowns slightly. &#x201C;To be honest, Young Master Xu&#x2026; I do not gauge you as inferior, but your request is fair enough. We do not want to involve others in this dispute, but if they are willing, we cannot complain. I must warn you, however &#x2013; we will not hold back.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course. Of course you won&#x2019;t,&#x201D; you grin. Turning to the girls, you cast your eyes over them. Yunzi looks particularly excited.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yifang, I choose you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She yells in surprise. &#x201C;M-me?&#x201D; She still steps forward, however, clutching her sword tightly. It looks like she is nervous about facing these two &#x2013; no wonder, given that they <i>are </i>respected orthodox pugilists, unlike the riffraff she has been dealing with thus far. Yunzi&apos;s face, on the other hand, is akin to a dark, cloudy storm; she seems rather disappointed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you travel with me, this is the sort of situation you have to face,&#x201D; you whisper. &#x201C;Fight as you see fit. I will try to match your movements.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yifang nods. &#x201C;I&#x2026; I understand.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is this really alright, Young Master Xu?&#x201D; You Lanhai seems concerned that you have picked this timid-looking waif of a girl to be your partner.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s already working.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. She is a better swordswoman than I. Come, if you need my head that much, please try your best, <i>qianbei</i>.&#x201D; Grinning, you put one hand on your wodao and beckon with the other.<br>
<br>
Zuo Qingfeng gives you a serious nod and draws his sword, as does his wife. &#x201C;Very well. No hard feelings, Young Master Xu.&#x201D; Their twin swords, Gan Jiang and Mo Ye, were forged as a pair according to the principles of <i>yin </i>and <i>yang</i> &#x2013; Gan Jiang embodies <i>yang</i>, and is a heavier, longer sword made out of pale metal, while Mo Ye embodies <i>yin</i>, being a thin, flexible blade constructed from darker material. Even from afar, you can tell that they are magnificently made, and a match for your Yuchang Sword in quality.<br>
<br>
The couple make the first move; Zuo taking the lead while You falls behind, advancing in his shadow. As you predicted, they come for you, ignoring Yifang. Gan Jiang cuts through the air, whistling loudly. You grasp the wodao&#x2019;s hilt and draw so quickly that your own blade is but a blur &#x2013; it knocks Zuo&#x2019;s blade away before returning to its sheath. He regains his balance quickly enough: his sword is heavy enough that even with your superior strength, a parry is unable to throw him off for any significant amount of time. At the same time, You darts out from behind him, her Mo Ye sword snaking up in a hard to follow movement that is deceptively slow.<br>
<br>
Yifang intercepts You Lanhai&#x2019;s thrust with a jab of her own, pushing Mo Ye away from your shoulder. Her sword darts gracefully through the air as she presses on against You, preventing her from assisting her husband. &#x201C;This is&#x2026; Emei swordplay!&#x201D; exclaims You. It looks like she recognizes Yifang&#x2019;s techniques. In the meantime, Zuo continues to battle you, swinging his sword with enough power to generate sword <i>qi</i>. He is strong&#x2026; but he is not as fast as Bai Jiutian. Creating gaps in his swordplay with well-timed quick draws of your wodao to parry or block, you advance. Even though you are faster, he is a good enough swordsman that you are unable to press your advantage with just the wodao. Every strike you make against his blade rattles your own, and you know you cannot continue this for long before the wodao breaks against Gan Jiang.<br>
<br>
The blade of your sword slides against the pale Gan Jiang again, and you deflect it with a twist of your wrist and an exertion of <i>qi</i>. Now you are in range. Snapping the sword back into its sheath with one hand, you strike at Zuo&#x2019;s head with an open claw, aiming for his temple. With a surprised look on his face, he barely manages to block your blow in time, drawing his sword back so that your fingers scrape the metal&#x2019;s surface instead of his flesh and bone. Grinning, you continue your assault, forcing Zuo to retreat under the relentless flurries of your Shouwang Claws. Zuo is out of his element at such a close range, and though he is no slouch at unarmed combat, you manage to break past his defense with pure speed and power.<br>
<br>
Zuo attempts an awkward slash from the poor position that you have forced him into, attempting to beat you back. You dart in even closer, within the reach of his arm and change your techniques suddenly; with your left palm you strike upwards and push his sword-arm away with a strong rush of <i>qi</i>, while your right palm unleashes the Fledgling Dragon&#x2019;s Sudden Advent, snapping forward and catching him right in the chest. The force of your strike lifts him off his feet. Zuo floats backwards and manages to land upright by using his <i>qinggong</i>. He clutches his chest, letting out a deep breath.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Qingfeng!&#x201D; You Lanhai lets loose with several strong piercing thrusts of sword <i>qi</i>, forcing you to disengage from Zuo Qingfeng. The two of them regroup as Yifang rushes to your side apologetically.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201D; she begins, her eyes downcast, &#x201C;that lady knew how to counter all of my Emei techniques. I switched to other styles, but although I gained the upper hand I couldn&#x2019;t disarm her quickly enough.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You clap her on the shoulder encouragingly. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not a problem. The real fight begins from here on in.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I knew you were not inferior, Young Master Xu,&#x201D; says Zuo with a smile. &#x201C;That speed&#x2026; that strength&#x2026; you are every bit as terrifying as your master was in his youth. No, perhaps even more. <i>And</i> I am sure that you are holding back on me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
In truth you had not held back that much; you did refrain from striking any lethal blows, but Zuo Qingfeng was good enough to sense the lack of killing intent, and would have been a lot more cautious from the start had you tried to do so, making the fight a whole lot harder. Still, you say, &#x201C;If you think I&#x2019;m still holding back, then doesn&#x2019;t that make it a very dangerous proposition for you to continue hunting my head?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I agree, but we have no choice.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is always a choice, <i>qianbei</i>. What drove you to hunt me down? From what I have heard of your reputation, you are not the sort to seek trouble like this. I have not offended you personally either, as far as I know. Is there some undesirable circumstance that forces your hand?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Young Master Xu&#x2026;&#x201D; Zuo seems conflicted, but You answers on his behalf. &#x201C;Our children are being held hostage by the Zhang family of Chang&#x2019;an. That is all there is to it, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is horrible!&#x201D; gasps Yifang.<br>
<br>
Indeed, given what happened with Fu Xia in Youxia City, it seems like just what the Zhang clan would do.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We are sorry to have to do this, but we cannot risk our twins for anything at all. You are a powerful pugilist, Xu Jing&#x2026; I am ashamed to admit that we might even have underestimated you a little. We will have to face you with our best technique, the Yuanyang Hudie Dream (&#x9D1B;&#x9D26;&#x8774;&#x8776;&#x5922;, Mandarin Ducks&#x2019; Butterfly Dream).&#x201D; Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai take up their stances, back to back.<br>
<br>
This technique of theirs is bad news. You focus, concentrating on their bodies and the flow of their <i>qi</i>&#x2026; but at the instant that they move, they slip out of your sight. It is not any form of overwhelming speed &#x2013; in fact, their <i>qi </i>almost seems to have dipped into levels so low that you can barely perceive them. Zuo and You fade in and out of your perception almost like the transient dream of a butterfly, difficult to comprehend and impossible to catch. Only your instincts save you at the last moment, as you swiftly raise your scabbard to block a sudden slash from your side. Before you can retaliate, Zuo has floated away, back into the dreamlike dance that he is performing with his wife.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Waiting here is just going to get ourselves defeated. Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D; you shout, dashing towards the couple &#x2013; this is the sort of technique where waiting for a chance to counterattack is futile&#x2026; you would have to pry it open yourself.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;R-right!&#x201D; Yifang follows suit, building up her will to fight.<br>
<br>
As the two of you attack Zuo and You, they put up a perfect defense, covering each other&#x2019;s blind spots and weaknesses in beautiful synchronicity. Gan Jiang&#x2019;s powerful, heavy slashes and Mo Ye&#x2019;s swift, light jabs combine to keep you from breaking past it. The revelation about their children being taken hostages also appears to be weighing on Yifang &#x2013; she seems to be turning more conflicted the longer she battles &#x2013; and as a result, the two of you are not teaming up as well as you could be at the moment.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s no use, Young Master Xu!&#x201D; shouts Zuo Qingfeng, as he turns aside your latest attack, forcing you to leap away before You Lanhai&#x2019;s blade skewers you, &#x201C;You will not beat this technique without a love greater than ours!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;L-l-love?&#x201D; stutters Yifang, as her concentration stirs slightly. Her movement dulls for just a bit. As the couple twirl around, You Lanhai sweeps her sword in an arc, but upon seeing Yifang being left open she hesitates. Her sword becomes slow enough for you to intercept; you dart forward.<br>
<br>
This is the chance you have been waiting for.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, you misjudge the distance thanks to the phantom-like nature of their technique and the flexibility of the Mo Ye sword. Instead of drawing her blade aside for you to launch a counterattack, you instead appear to take it in the shoulder on Yifang&#x2019;s behalf. Gritting your teeth, you launch a powerful slash from your wodao in retaliation, perhaps a bit stronger than you meant it to be.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Lanhai!&#x201D; Shouting out in a panic, Zuo Qingfeng moves to intercept the attack meant for his wife. Gripping Gan Jiang with two hands, he swings down hard.<br>
<br>
There is a loud clang as metal breaks.<br>
<br>
Your wodao snaps in half, the rigours of constant battle over the past week finally proving too much for even such a fine blade to handle.<br>
<br>
You do not stop, however. Making the most of this opportunity, you toss the blade at him and step forward before letting loose with a powerful cross with your Raging Claws of the Mad Lion. Caught off guard, the Yuanyang Hudie Dream technique no longer in play thanks to the successive distractions, the blow lands on Zuo before he can defend himself. He is thrown back, his robes tearing and the skin of his chest splitting open in bright red lines. <br>
<br>
He staggers away from you, his wife rushing to his side as she screams his name.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; We cannot defeat you at this time, it seems,&#x201D; he coughs. Though you have caused him injury, there is no hatred or anger in his gaze, only a subdued acceptance.<br>
<br>
You think that he might be slightly too pessimistic: though he is rather seriously wounded, he should still be able to perform the Yuanyang Hudie Dream &#x2013; you are not confident of your chances in defeating that technique alone or with Yifang. Of course, on the other hand, if you called for help from the other girls, they would eventually be distracted and overpowered. You rub the shallow wound on your shoulder, blood trickling down your arm. Still, your intent at the moment is not to crush them, and you say, &#x201C;What next? I <i>would</i> prefer to be left alone, Master Zuo.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I cannot do that. I must kill you, or die trying&#x2026; but more and more I think it an impossible hurdle. That last exchange has shown me that you have an edge as a fighter that I do not, even when fighting to protect my children,&#x201D; he says despondently. &#x201C;You could have killed me with that last blow, couldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You could have, though you stayed your hand. You still had the Wuxiang Qiankun technique up your sleeve too, though how well it would perform against the mysterious Butterfly Dream might be a real question.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Dear, stay strong,&#x201D; cries You Lanhai as she holds him up. &#x201C;We cannot give up here! Let us flee and try again another time!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My love, do you actually think we have any hope of defeating Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple? Even our most powerful technique&#x2026; the symbol of our love&#x2026;&#x201D; The stress of the events he is under seems to be taking its toll; being unable to soundly defeat you even after using his best technique appears to be a shock that is driving Zuo Qingfeng into depression.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Even so, we must keep trying until our death,&#x201D; states You Lanhai calmly. &#x201C;Or our children will never be free.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you really trust the Zhang family to keep their promises?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What other option do we have? They are ruthless&#x2026; ruthless enough to kill our children in cold blood should we &#x2013; or anyone &#x2013; make a move against them,&#x201D; sighs You.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you let us go here to recover, we will return to fight you again, Young Master Xu,&#x201D; says Zuo. &#x201C;Perhaps you might want to settle matters more conclusively right now. This is all of the courtesy that is in my power to offer you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You decide to fight to the death with Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai, using whatever you deem necessary. At this point, it is not a fight you think you would lose, though you wouldn&#x2019;t escape unscathed either. You will just have to hold out hope for rescuing their children after their death.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You let them go, and tell them that you are looking into ways of taking down the Zhang family. You request that they stall for time as safely as they can for their children&#x2019;s sake while you do so. Perhaps Chief Jiang might be able to pull off something here.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been thinking,&#x201D; Qilin mutters later that night. &#x201C;Perhaps I should go to my mother.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why? What&#x2019;s this, all of a sudden?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Things are getting more dangerous, and my mother seems to have a hand in all of this. If I return to her side&#x2026; pretend to be a filial daughter&#x2026; maybe I can be of better help to you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You shake your head. &#x201C;Would she even believe you? I did not see her face, but I heard her talk to Bai Jiutian. She sounds like a formidable woman.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She is,&#x201D; Qilin laughs. &#x201C;Which is why she has a formidable daughter that managed to snag a pretty good catch. I&#x2019;ll just say that all of your philandering ways have made me terribly jealous.&#x201D; With a tiny smile, she adds in a small voice, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a joke.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Somehow, you feel that it&#x2019;s not entirely one.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You let her go. If Qilin makes a successful infiltration, this could place her in good position to feed you even more useful information than Bai Jiutian, who you don&#x2019;t fully trust yet.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do not let her go. It is too dangerous; even more dangerous than staying with you. Her place is here, by your side.

            <h3>三十九 · Templefront</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Templefront</span></b><br>
<br>
The trip towards Luoyang passes uneventfully. Zuo Qingfeng, citing his injuries as a reason, will stay away until he has recovered, trying to buy more time while you send a message to Chief Jiang, informing him of the current situation. The number of Xuxian&#x2019;s pursuers have gradually dwindled too, as his arrival at Shaolin Temple becomes more and more inevitable with each passing day.<br>
<br>
Qilin, on the other hand, is behaving as she usually does; she has not mentioned the offer to spy on her mother again since you rejected that suggestion. What happened next pleased her in more ways than one&#x2026; and caused no end of red faces amongst the rest of the group the next morning. The inn&#x2019;s room had really thin walls.<br>
<br>
You had been holding back thus far on your journey to avoid this sort of awkwardness, but some things just had to happen, sooner or later.<br>
<br>
As you travel past fields and rivers, you notice constant building works occurring throughout the land. Apparently, the minor droughts that started during the previous Emperor&#x2019;s time had only become worse, and the astrologers had no explanation for this phenomenon; surely it was unthinkable that the new Emperor &#x2013; and by virtue of the way of succession, the entire dynasty &#x2013; had already lost Heaven&#x2019;s favour? Shun had not been idle, however, and with Xiahou Yu&#x2019;s help he had quickly devised an irrigation and farming system that would alleviate the problems for the farmers throughout the country. According to the commoners that you conversed with along the way, the efforts of the past year were already bearing fruit. The people were optimistic that Shun&#x2019;s rule would reverse the flagging fortunes of the empire thus far and bring them back into a golden age.<br>
<br>
You catch up with Xuxian on the outskirts of Luoyang. Upon seeing you, his first instinct was to turn and run, but you managed to waylay him long enough to talk to him, and convince him that you bear him no ill will.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My master bid me return here to receive my punishment,&#x201D; explains Xuxian, his head bowed. &#x201C;It was wrong of me to sneak a peek at those pages, let alone learn its technique without permission. Panicking and injuring the Abbot while trying to escape my punishment was an even greater sin.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How did you even come by it in the first place?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; found it. There was a hidden inscription under the kitchen stoves, covered by the soot. I discovered it one day while cleaning, and realized that it was a hint as to where the pages were hidden. Unable to contain my curiosity, I tracked them down and began learning from them in secret. I was eventually found out when I accidentally exerted a bit of my power during a sparring session and injured a fellow monk.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They didn&#x2019;t take kindly to that, did they?&#x201D; The temple was known to be very strict when it came to martial arts, and you can&#x2019;t imagine that has changed for the better since Fangzhang&#x2019;s death.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, they didn&#x2019;t. Abbot Fangci took the pages and burnt them, saying that they should not be practiced at all. They then tried to capture me, but I was so fearful for my life that I punched the Abbot in the face and ran off.&#x201D; Xuxian looks so despondent and regretful that you pat him on the shoulder.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, we&#x2019;ll see what can be done. I have a bit of business with Shaolin myself,&#x201D; you say, which is perhaps partially true, &#x201C;and I&#x2019;ll go with you into the temple.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you, Young Master Xu!&#x201D; exclaims Xuxian with genuine gratitude. &#x201C;I was very nervous about going in alone, so your offer is very much appreciated!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You wonder how the monks are going to deal with him&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The gates of Shaolin are not very grand, but it encompasses a large plot of land that dwarfs any of the other Eight Sects. The temple has traditionally established good relations with the imperial court, and that still remains despite the respective changes in leadership over the years. It is an institution that is not wanting for resources. You look up at the stone placard proudly proclaiming Shaolin&#x2019;s name, and then at the disciples at the gates eyeing your presence warily.<br>
<br>
Of course, women are not allowed on the temple grounds.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You have the girls wait for you outside the temple while you enter with Xuxian. If, on the off chance, there is any problem at all with this visit, they will know from the shouts and screams coming from within the gates anyway.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You have disguised the girls beforehand as boys &#x2013; you&#x2019;ll just bring them in with you. The monks will be infuriated if they find out about your deception, but you are not here to please them. You think they will be of help if you keep them closer at hand.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You push your way past the gates with the girls in tow. There is no need to be subtle here &#x2013; the rules about not allowing women are generally exempted for their fellow orthodox pugilists when they visit, and you do not think you should be afforded any less courtesy.

            <h3>四十 · Masters of Shaolin</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Masters of Shaolin</span></b><br>
<br>
Finally, you enter Shaolin Temple. You leave the girls at the gates, under the watch of the monks &#x2013; while you are within the temple, they will be considered to be under Shaolin&#x2019;s protection. Yunzi had been rather displeased that you were leaving her behind, and you asked Armaiti to keep an eye on her; you had spotted the Holy Maiden taking out a false moustache in secret, thinking that she wasn&apos;t being observed.<br>
<br>
A nervous junior monk leads you into the temple grounds, past the training square, where you see a few dozen monks practicing their daily exercises, and through the pagoda forest. Xuxian follows behind, head bowed, while Xuezi walks conceitedly in front of you, glancing at the relics of fighting saints with disdain in her eyes. &#x201C;Short-lived fools,&#x201D; she mutters.<br>
<br>
Before long, you reach the main hall of the temple. The monk scurries away wordlessly, leaving you to enter the dusky hall by yourself. Faint smoke wafts through the air from the burning incense, and a large statue of the Buddha is placed prominently, towering over the monks standing within. You see Xuzhan and his friends &#x2013; they look very surprised to see you with Xuxian, but do not forget their manners and bow. Xuxian bows deeply in return, while you give a friendly nod. There are other monks here; perhaps half a dozen elders, in addition to twenty strong, youthful lads, and standing over them all is Abbot Fangci, the man who now leads Shaolin after Fangzhang&#x2019;s death.<br>
<br>
He is&#x2026; not what you expected.<br>
<br>
Where Fangzhang had been a venerable looking man &#x2013; despite his private disposition &#x2013; with an elegant, long white beard and a wiry, ascetic frame, Fangci is quite different. His robes fail to adequately hide the strong, muscular build underneath; despite his age, here is a man that is every bit as physically imposing as Master Zhang. His beard is not long and scholarly, but a great white bush sticking out fiercely from his jaw. In fact, were it not for the nine dots burnt onto his gleaming, shaved pate that mark his monasticism, he would seem more like a legendary warlord of the Three Kingdoms than the abbot of a monastery. Or some Buddhist avatar of destruction, from the way he glowers at you majestically.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, is that muscled baldy the current abbot?&#x201D; asks Xuezi, her voice loud in comparison to the hushed whisper of the monks&#x2026; a whisper that drops into utter silence immediately after her question. You tense up slightly, wondering how Abbot Fangci would react.<br>
<br>
The muscled baldy gives a grunt of acknowledgement. &#x201C;Yes, I am, little girl. Who might you be?&#x201D; His voice is deep, like the rumbling of a rocky mountain.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your granny-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
You grab Xuezi and cover her mouth, laughing. &#x201C;Oh, children nowadays!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xuxian&#x2019;s face is deathly pale, sweat pouring off his face as he stares at the polished wooden floor.<br>
<br>
The abbot chuckles drily, one furry white eyebrow arched high. &#x201C;I did not know that you had a child, Xu Jing. She should not be here for this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As you can see, Abbot, she has a spirit that is hard to repress.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If that is the case, I will say no more. You are not of the temple. I have no right to instruct you on how you discipline your young ones. Xuxian!&#x201D; he barks, causing the lad to stiffen up in fright. &#x201C;Kneel.&#x201D; Fangci points to a padded cushion of the sort the monks commonly use for prolonged prayer to spare their knees.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, Abbot!&#x201D; squeaks Xuxian, who falls to his knees on the cushion immediately and puts his palms together in repentance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We are glad that you have returned to face your judgement, Xuxian,&#x201D; says Fangci as he places his hands behind his back, &#x201C;but know that it will not be lenient. The laws of the temple must be followed.&#x201D; Turning his head, he glances at you. &#x201C;I think you did not come here just to stand by and watch, Xu Jing. If you have anything to say, now is the time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You take a deep breath. &#x201C;I do not truly understand where his sin lies, Master Fangci. Could you explain it to a layman? Is it because he injured you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That would warrant punishment, but it is not the whole story. The Xiaoming Jiuyang Divine Skill is something forbidden for any of our monks to learn, as it promotes imbalance and aggression if not studied in a careful, measured manner&#x2026; and the temptation to rush its practice is something no man has ever resisted. Even the best of our monks have fallen to its lure, centuries ago, and it has only led to pointless bloodshed. It is a <i>dangerous </i>skill that should be wiped from existence, along with the other two.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yet rumours remain that Shaolin has kept the skill till now,&#x201D; you comment.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And we have always denied it, because we thought we truly did not possess it. It was by mere luck that young Xuxian discovered those pages,&#x201D; replied Fangci. &#x201C;His first mistake was in not reporting it, and hiding it for himself. That is covetousness.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xuxian has no response for this &#x2013; he seems to regret that action.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I understand why he would do so,&#x201D; continues the Abbot, his brows furrowed. &#x201C;As a novice he was falling behind his brothers in martial prowess. But it was not the right thing to do, and that is the truth. His second mistake was in practicing the manual, and being unable to control its power. That lack of control will ruin him one day, and all those around him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;T-that&#x2019;s not true, Abbot Fangci,&#x201D; Xuxian says tremulously, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve learnt to control it better now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Have you now?&#x201D; Fangci is unconvinced. &#x201C;Does that mean you still want to keep the power of the Taifeng Zhenyang <i>neigong</i> within you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xuxian does not answer &#x2013; it looks like despite what he has said, he is not entirely ready to give up the power he has achieved.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Simple human nature,&#x201D; sighs the Abbot. &#x201C;But you will accept your punishment nevertheless?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; replies Xuxian hesitantly, his head lowered.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you going to strip him of his <i>neigong</i>?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The skill is bound so tightly within him that we will have to cripple him to remove it,&#x201D; states Fangci matter-of-factly. &#x201C;He will not be able to move his limbs again, but the temple will take care of him from now on.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is&#x2026; a very harsh thing to do,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is our law, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Can you not teach him to control his power, and to use it in moderation? I thought Shaolin was the best at teaching martial arts.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will not risk having this heretical art spread throughout the temple. As the Abbot, it is my duty to remove whatever traces of it that I can.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The only thing he learnt were a few pages. The entire manual is still out there, perhaps in the hands of people who would gladly raze your temple to the ground.&#x201D; You attempt to sway Fangci, downplaying what Xuxian has learnt.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I have received news from Master Qi. That does not concern Shaolin. We will match them without needing to rely on such techniques,&#x201D; says the Abbot bluntly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;match?&#x201D; Does he mean that Shaolin Temple is preparing to fight?<br>
<br>
He shakes his head, folding his arms. &#x201C;I have said enough for now, Xu Jing. If you have something else to say, it can wait until after Xuxian has received his punishment. Now&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you citing Shaolin law, muscled baldy?&#x201D; pipes up Xuezi suddenly. Fangci gives her a glowering stare, but she does not back down.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I happen to remember something about that,&#x201D; she grins, walking about the hall with her hands placed behind her back. &#x201C;Reverend&#x2026; Huichan, was it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is&#x2026; the name of my fighting master. What of him?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t he accused of learning some unorthodox technique of some sort, but the abbot of the time allowed him to go free when he demonstrated he was able to use it in accordance with Shaolin&apos;s Buddhist principles?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The monks murmur loudly, as the older ones amongst them begin reminiscing about that event.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is&#x2026;&#x201D; Fangci falls silent for a while, before saying, &#x201C;Trial by combat. First, face the Eighteen Bronze Arhat Formation, and then battle the current Abbot. Huichan was the first in temple history to convince an Abbot in such a trial.&#x201D; Then he adds, with a wry smile, &#x201C;After that, Fangzhang followed suit, and was the only one to ever actually defeat a presiding Abbot soundly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There you have it! Precedent! Why do you monks insist on shaving your ugly heads bald, I do not know, since exposure to the winds certainly does not help your dulled, scripture-obsessed brains think better!&#x201D; exclaims Xuezi proudly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just <i>who </i>are you, little girl?&#x201D; The Abbot&#x2019;s eyes narrow suspiciously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your moth-&quot;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She&#x2019;s a smart girl, isn&#x2019;t she, Master Fangci?&#x201D; you say, covering up her mouth again as she struggles. &#x201C;So, would you be willing to grant Xuxian such a chance to prove himself?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Fangci&#x2019;s booming laugh echoes around the hall, amused by your request. &#x201C;Do you think it <i>easy</i>, Xu Jing? This trial necessitates that you prove you are <i>worthy </i>of using a technique in a way that does not disgrace Shaolin&#x2019;s name. It means that you must not harm or kill your opponent in the trial, that you demonstrate skill and mercy in your <i>wugong</i>. Are you confident that you can defeat us in such a manner, with your half-hearted mastery of martial arts, Xuxian?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I do not know,&#x201D; mumbles Xuxian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you beat the Abbot before? Just go even more lightly on him this time around,&#x201D; you whisper.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am pretty sure he was holding back at the time,&#x201D; mutters Xuxian nervously. &#x201C;To take both him and the Eighteen Arhats on without injuring any of them&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t know if I can do that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you cannot, you must submit to your punishment. If you succeed, I am willing to spare you on the condition that you can never impart that skill to anyone else&#x2026; I may trust you to use it wisely, but any disciples you take are another matter,&#x201D; says the Abbot.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Can he not have assistance in this trial?&#x201D; you ask, attempting to seek out any loopholes in the trial.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That would defeat the purpose entirely! The point is to prove he is worthy and redeem himself from punishment!&#x201D; says Fangci, making a large gesture. It looks like he is getting displeased at your constant stalling; his courtesy may not extend much further. &#x201C;One&#x2019;s sins can not be shouldered by others.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, is that truly so?&#x201D; you grin. You remembered at least <i>one </i>story, thankfully. &#x201C;Did Mu Lian not perform meritorious deeds on behalf of his mother, who he wished to save from suffering in hell? Surely you will not reject an act performed under the same principle!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Er&#x2026; I suppose,&#x201D; grumbles Fangci. &#x201C;Well, it is not that I wish to forbid it, but if you are to share in the trial, you must also share in the punishment, should he or you fail. Are you willing to do so, Xu Jing? If you fail, we will consider you as having failed our precepts, under our teachings, and inflict upon you the same punishment as Xuxian.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh.&#x201D; That is probably something you should consider.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you accept, then the two of you may pick which part of the trial you would like to challenge: would you face me, or the Eighteen Arhats? Do not worry. The difficulty is nearly equal, for I am not as strong as my predecessor, Abbot Fangzhang,&#x201D; says Fangci as he stands there calmly with his bulging muscles.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the old man has a sense of humour after all &#x2013; just because he is not as strong as Fangzhang doesn&#x2019;t mean that he is not <i>strong</i>.<br>
<br>
You look at the sweating Xuxian. &#x201C;What do you want to do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll give my best and fight, but I cannot expect you to risk your own <i>wugong </i>to assist me, Young Master Xu. Just the help you rendered in providing this chance for a trial by combat is sufficient. Asking you for more help at this point would be improper,&#x201D; he says.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you <i>sure </i>you want to do this? If you fail, you will be crippled for life,&#x201D; you remind him.<br>
<br>
He still seems conflicted; part of him probably does want to leave. Leaving now, however, would likely incur Shaolin&#x2019;s wrath.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will accept the challenge and assist Xuxian in this fight. Why else did you come? Failing the trial just a risk you will have to take, though given the strict conditions of the fight, it may be a very real risk.<br>
<ol>
<li>You face Abbot Fangci. Xuxian seems to fear him plenty, and that may be a mental block if he is to duel the Abbot. His comment about being weaker than Fangzhang does not necessarily mean he is weaker than the Arhats, too. He also seems like the beefy sort who is less likely to be injured by your techniques, compared to the rest of the skinny monks.</li>
<li>You face the Eighteen Bronze Arhat Formation. It may be easier for Xuxian to deal with one opponent than with several, and he <i>has </i>fought the Abbot before this. Besides, each individual Arhat is definitely weaker than the Abbot, and if you rely on your speed you should be able to take them apart without causing them too much harm. Take one down and the formation should crumble.</li>
</ol><b>B. </b>You let Xuxian take the challenge alone; it is his burden to bear, after all. You will provide him with any aid necessary in the short amount of time you have before the trial, perhaps by trying to improve his skill and control together with Xuezi. but after that he is on his own. You cannot risk your own martial arts for his sake. If he succeeds, good. If he fails, then that is just how it is.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You grab Xuxian and Xuezi and run. It would likely start a brawl with all of the monks here, but fighting to escape is probably doable &#x2013; they won&#x2019;t be trying to kill you after all. You have no patience for their numerous rules and regulations, and it is just a waste of Xuxian&#x2019;s power for it to be destroyed here.

            <h3>四十一 · Masters of Shaolin II</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Masters of Shaolin II</span></b><br>
<br>
You sincerely hope that Xuxian is prepared. He is standing in the middle of the largest square in the temple, awaiting the arrival of the Eighteen Arhats.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I hope this fight was worth the wait outside,&#x201D; says Yunzi, still sulking from being left out. You had obtained special dispensation from the Abbot to allow the girls in, as it was not certain how long the trial would take. Fangci had seemed to appreciate your suggestion of a trial &#x2013; you wonder if deep down inside he was hoping that Xuxian would indeed prove himself worthy.<br>
<br>
Qilin suddenly sidles up closer to you, nestling her head against your shoulder, and Cao&#x2019;er does the same from the other side. The young monks around you have given your party a wide berth, and from the tortured look on their faces they seem to be trying their best not to stare at the one-eyed man sitting there, surrounded by a bevy of beautiful women hanging off his arms.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It might be better if you did not attract so much attention, Young Master Xu,&#x201D; coughs Reverend Zhixing, one of the elders of the temple.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sorry, reverend,&#x201D; you say, glaring at the girls. They must have done it on purpose.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the crowd of monks hush up.<br>
<br>
The Eighteen Bronze Arhats have arrived. Dressed only in saffron trousers, every inch of their well-trained bodies have been painted with bronze. You are unable to separate them from a glance under all that paint, and they take up their positions wordlessly in front of Xuxian.<br>
<br>
Being the junior monk, he offers them a bow. They return it respectfully.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If he remembers the strategy, these monks will not be too much of a problem,&#x201D; says Xuezi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s hope he does,&#x201D; you sigh.<br>
<br>
A gong is rung to signify the start of the trial.<br>
<br>
Xuxian slides into a defensive posture and remains still. After a brief wait, realizing that he was not going to make the first move, the Eighteen Arhats spring into motion. Unlike the more free-flowing formations that you have fought, the Eighteen Bronze Arhats Formation is fast, powerful, and overwhelming. Xuxian&#x2019;s defensive stance is insufficient to ward off all of their blows&#x2026; but he does not need to. You recognize his style of breathing &#x2013; he is using Jinzhongzhao.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Taifeng Zhenyang <i>neigong</i> is well suited for this defensive technique,&#x201D; comments Xuezi. &#x201C;It would have helped him increase his understanding of Jinzhongzhao. He is not a master yet, but he is approaching that level.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In a similar way to how I gain other benefits from meditating on Wuxiang Qiankun?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, in that way. As long as he remains calm here, he should be able to pick off the bronzed baldies one by one,&#x201D; Xuezi shrugs.<br>
<br>
Xuxian continues to hold out under their onslaught. Minutes pass before he gathers enough confidence to make the first move, perhaps having seen an opportunity he could grasp. He thrusts two fingers forward, shouting as he does so. An invisible force knocks one of the Arhats back. Taking advantage of the hole in their formation, he moves to attack, trading blows with the other monks using a Tibetan boxing style they are unfamiliar with. He fails to achieve a knockout blow, however, and soon the Arhat recovers and rejoins the fight&#x2026; and the process repeats itself.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use such a time-wasting tactic,&#x201D; says Yunzi, concentrating on the fight. &#x201C;I would&#x2026; yes, I would obliterate the first target with overwhelming force at the very start of the fight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You might fail for using too much strength if you don&#x2019;t judge that first attack correctly,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, they&#x2019;re just being too strict, aren&#x2019;t they? It&#x2019;s difficult if you have to hold back against eighteen people at that speed and power.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the point, Holy Maiden,&#x201D; says Armaiti.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What would you do?&#x201D; you ask Armaiti in turn.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am confident in my defensive ability, like that monk over there. I also know a technique or two for shaking the battlefield up, so fighting multiple people is not a big deal for me,&#x201D; she winks. &#x201C;Still&#x2026; this formation is not easy to handle. I must admit, I am impressed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You have to agree. The fighters are individually skilled, and it moves quickly enough that a single misstep would have you overwhelmed. You could surpass any single member in speed and power, but in aggregate, they would make for a fearsome foe. A straight fight would be difficult even if you were fighting to kill.<br>
<br>
As the sun rises high into the sky, the Arhats step up the intensity of their attacks; understanding the sheer defensive strength of Xuxian&#x2019;s Jinzhongzhao, they begin throwing attacks that would inflict real injury on an unprotected opponent. Xuxian&#x2019;s breathing gradually grows more laboured, but he remains focused. He is still confident that they cannot harm him, affording him room to slowly whittle down their formation.<br>
<br>
Then, six of the Arhats leap into the air, emitting killing intent. Xuxian&#x2019;s head snaps towards them, his eyes wide open. For a moment you think he might lose his concentration, but at the last minute he jumps aside, avoiding their attacks. As three more approach him from behind, he clenches his fists and girds his body &#x2013; they strike at his back with full force. Xuxian stumbles forward just slightly, unharmed. He grits his teeth, taking a deep breath, and lets out a loud yell, unleashing his massive <i>qi</i>. The pressure knocks his attackers off their feet. Stepping back, he does not follow up and returns to his defensive posture, sweat streaming down his face.<br>
<br>
The Arhats do not attack. Helping their brethren up, they face Xuxian in a line, and bow. His tense face sags in relief at their action &#x2013; it looks like they have accepted him. He has succeeded in passing this stage of the trial.<br>
<br>
The audience murmurs, impressed by Xuxian&#x2019;s showing.<br>
<br>
After giving Xuxian a few minutes to regain his breath, the Abbot himself steps out into the square. Xuxian freezes up when he does so. Fangci shakes his head, and says, &#x201C;Calm down, Xuxian. This is your last challenge. You must be tired from facing the Eighteen Arhats, and you did well enough against them, so I will use only one move while your mind is still fresh.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Spreading his feet apart, Fangci loosens his cassock, revealing a heavily muscled and scarred body. He clearly did not get those weapon scars while meditating and training as a monk at Shaolin Temple&#x2026; you wonder what curious past the Abbot has behind him. He takes one step forward and settles into a powerful stance, fists closed, and glares at Xuxian. Instantly, you feel an immense killing intent rising from Fangci that suffuses the arena. The younger monks back away nervously though the elders continue to watch on calmly. Xuxian lets out a little whimper, but remains in his stance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;All you need to do is to defeat this technique without harming me,&#x201D; Fangci speaks. &#x201C;But if you cannot, I will kill you right here. My fist will run red with your blood. This is your final test. Can you hold back and show mercy to someone who would take your life?&#x201D; All the while, his killing intent builds, honing and sharpening by the second.<br>
<br>
Xuxian&#x2019;s eyes dart from side to side, nervously looking for an exit to avoid taking the attack head on, but there is none. You can tell by his stance: Abbot Fangci has positioned himself in a way to seal off all of Xuxian&#x2019;s possible exits with one simple footstep. The power gathering in Fangci&#x2019;s body is nothing to laugh at either&#x2026; you have no doubt that he knows how to defeat Xuxian&#x2019;s Jinzhongzhao, should he want to. That may make all the difference: while he was secure in the belief that the Eighteen Arhats were unable to bypass his defensive skill, he fears that the Abbot is a different matter entirely. He would have to rely on something other than Jinzhongzhao here.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;T-this is scary. Is he going to be alright?&#x201D; asks Yifang worriedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s something off about this, but I can&#x2019;t tell what&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Lingshu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, a child&#x2019;s trick,&#x201D; mumbles Xuezi uninterestedly.<br>
<br>
You are not as dismissive as she is, but you have to agree.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is because you have spent so much time training with Zhang Jue, but you can instantly see through the trick. You instinctively realize that he has no real intention of landing a hit; unlike your master, who would gladly do it for real if you let him. Fangci&#x2019;s projected killing intent is false: it appears fearful and oppressive, but it is nothing more than a mask.<br>
<br>
You open your mouth to warn Xuxian, but the Abbot moves before you can say anything. Shouting loudly, his feet kicking off the stones, he covers the distance between him and Xuxian in a single bound. As he brings his fist towards Xuxian&#x2019;s chest, the young monk screams, his eyes vacant. He raises both hands, fingers outstretched, nothing but fear and panic reflected in his expression.<br>
<br>
The both of them strike simultaneously. Fangci&#x2019;s fist stops just short of Xuxian&#x2019;s chest, his sharp killing intent melting away into thin air as if it had never been in the first place. Numerous parallel red lines sprout along his arm and chest, as Xuxian retaliates with a cutting finger technique. He had regained control of himself just a little too late.<br>
<br>
His expression a blank, Xuxian falls to his knees. He appears to be in a daze. The Abbot looks down at him, his bearded face inscrutable. The elders of Shaolin jump into the square, surrounding the both of them. Immediately, you leap to your feet, and rush towards them.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master Fangci!&#x201D; you shout. The elders, upon seeing you, step aside quietly. It seems that they are content to allow Fangci to do the speaking.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, Xu Jing?&#x201D; The abbot does not lift his eyes away from Xuxian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2026; do realize that he held back at the last minute, do you not?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Fangci rubs the bloody cuts across his arm and nods. &#x201C;Yes. He would have taken my arm off otherwise. I almost underestimated the fear and anger inside him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fear and anger? Don&#x2019;t you think it is unfair to be expected to repay murderous intent with mercy?&#x201D; He did try to trick Xuxian into genuinely believing he would be killed. You did not think Fangci would have gone this far.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>Unfair</i>? But this are the standards that we must hold ourself to,&#x201D; says Fangci sternly, almost angrily. &#x201C;It is easy to be gracious when you are in no danger at all. Far more difficult to show mercy when you are in true peril. To wield the <i>neigong </i>of the Xiaoming Jiuyang Divine Skill, one <i>must </i>aspire to be as a bodhisvatta. Wise monks more enlightened than any you see here have been led astray by the manual in the past. I see no reason to expect anything less.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yet, he did withdraw his attack at the last moment. He did show mercy,&#x201D; you argue. &#x201C;He is <i>not </i>a lost cause, Abbot.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, he did,&#x201D; admits Fangci.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So he should not be given a punishment as drastic as a permanent crippling.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Fangci closes his eyes, and then, after what seems like an eternity, nods.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, he should not.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I still cannot allow him to go free. The fact remains that he did lose control. It would be too risky to let Xuxian be. No, he will be cloistered here, in Shaolin, to meditate in seclusion. We have precedent for that&#x2026; Xuxian shall meditate for fifty two years, one year for each of the mental formations of Buddhism. He will not be allowed any freedom from the temple until it is complete, and his mind clear. Is that fair?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I would accept that,&#x201D; mumbles Xuxian quietly, looking downcast.<br>
<br>
Still, fifty two years&#x2026; he would be older than Abbot Fangci when his punishment is complete.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is there no other way?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You seem very keen on setting young Xuxian free. Why is that?&#x201D; Fangci asks, his gaze piercing.<br>
<br>
You pull out a smirk &#x2013; one of the cocky ones &#x2013; &#x201C;I just don&#x2019;t have a taste for people being punished for almost failing a test.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Abbot&#x2019;s eyebrow rises high. &#x201C;Almost <i>failing</i>, you say?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Almost failing,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;He would fail if he did not hold back, but in the end, he did.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose it is in how you look at it, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; shrugs the Abbot. &#x201C;But in the end, you are an outsider. Do you think your opinion has any weight here, Xu Jing?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Only when it seems to coincide with your wishes, it seems, as you were happy to go along with the trial, and with suggesting a more lenient punishment.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm. Quite the mouth you have on you there, boy,&#x201D; snorts Fangci. He does not seem too keen on continuing the conversation further; as far as he is concerned, the matter is over.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What if he wasn&#x2019;t an outsider?&#x201D; Xuezi speaks up suddenly.<br>
<br>
Fangci stares at her. &#x201C;You again, strangely knowledgeable little girl? What do you mean?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You <i>know </i>what I mean, muscled baldy. The way for outsiders to gain respect as honorary members of Shaolin Temple without having to do that ugly shave that all of you baldy monks do!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Fangci frowns. &#x201C;That? The gauntlet?&#x201D; The elders look at each other and begin whispering. They seem to know just what it is.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Gauntlet?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Forget it, Xu Jing. It is too dangerous. You would have to defeat the Seventy-Two Wooden Mannequin Labyrinth of Doom, followed by the Thirty-Six Armored Warriors of Damo, the Eighteen Bronze Arhat Formation, and the Nine Venerable Shaolin Elders, before finally facing me, the Abbot, Master of Shaolin, all in a single day,&#x201D; he says dismissively. &#x201C;Any deaths and injuries on the part of the challengers will be ascribed to karma. The Abbot who designed it did not mean for anyone to ever pass the test... I believe he was just making a statement to the Wudang head of the time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You challenge the gauntlet because it is there to be challenged. It may also help you free Xuxian, if you succeed, and impress Shaolin Temple if you do it correctly. On the downside, it <i>does</i> sound particularly dangerous&#x2026; but when has that ever stopped you?<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You grab Xuxian and run, regardless of how he or Shaolin feels about it. You have no interest in the gauntlet, and you do not think he should have been considered to have failed the test in the first place. It is not fair.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You allow Xuxian to go into seclusion. Although the Shaolin monks will not to let you into the library, perhaps you can successfully sneak in during the aftermath of this trial. After all, you don&#x2019;t want to come this far without leaving empty-handed.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You are perfectly fine with leaving empty-handed, and leave Shaolin Temple. You will head for Luoyang to figure out your next step.

            <h3>四十二 · The Shaolin Gauntlet</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Shaolin Gauntlet</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;It sounds like a great way to spend my time. I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201D; You nod firmly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good, good&#x2026; wait, what did you say?&#x201D; Abbot Fangci turns and stares at you, his beard bristling. The elders gasp as one.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, come now, Abbot&#x2026; I did not think you were <i>that </i>old to already be hard of hearing? I said, I&#x2019;ll do it. I&#x2019;ll take on this challenge you have.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure- no, of course you are sure,&#x201D; mutters the Abbot as a bemused smile suddenly comes across his face. &#x201C;You are, after all, Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple. It is only to be expected. Very well. I will not waste time refusing you. You have your wish; we will prepare the gauntlet. It will take some time so the challenge will begin tomorrow morning. You may rest in the temple until then.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You are given a guest room in the temple &#x2013; one of the larger ones, as all of the girls are crammed into it together with you. It looks like the monks had decided that it would be best to contain the fruits of temptation in one place, lest it spread like a disease. Well, it was not like you minded.<br>
<br>
Xuxian had been escorted to his quarters for confinement by the elders &#x2013; he would have to stay there to meditate on his actions for the time being.<br>
<br>
As night fell, you decided to ask Xuezi for more information on the gauntlet. As she brought it up, perhaps she would know more about its details.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know anything more about it. I just know there is a gauntlet,&#x201D; she says, stuffing her mouth with food.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t expect me to remember every insignificant detail I&#x2019;ve ever heard of in my life, boy! It is not a serious matter. Just deal with it like you usually do. I only said it out of spite, because I knew those baldies didn&#x2019;t like people hearing about the challenge.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Before you can respond, there is a knock at the door. Sighing, you get it.<br>
<br>
Xuzhan is standing there, steadfastly keeping his eyes averted from the room.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing sinful going on inside, even if you look,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-I know that. I&#x2019;m just being careful, Young Master Xu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;So, what is it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know it is late, but some guests just arrived at the temple. I thought you would be interested in meeting them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Guests, at this hour? Shaolin is not exactly known for its hospitality &#x2013; you do realize you had been done a favour by not being kicked out and told to come back the next day. Anyone allowed into the temple at this time of the night would have to be a friend of the sect.<br>
<br>
You nod. &#x201C;Right. Where are they?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They expressed interest in meeting you too, so I took the liberty of bringing them here,&#x201D; replies Xuzhan. Looking over his shoulder, he calls out to the guests.<br>
<br>
A big, burly man dressed in Wudang&#x2019;s blue robes comes into view, followed by a woman carrying a child. He breaks into a wide grin when he sees you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Jing! It has been a long time,&#x201D; he says happily, coming up to you. Somehow, he has grown even <i>more </i>since you last saw him, and a respectable beard now decorates his hard jaw. His wife, Pu&#x2019;er, smiles, bowing politely. &#x201C;Xu Jing. It has been a while. Chong&#x2019;er, greet Uncle Xu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The child in her arms takes one look at you and instantly turns back to his mother with teary eyes. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s&#x2026; scary,&#x201D; mumbles the boy. Pu&#x2019;er frowns, disapproving of his impolite behaviour.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, don&#x2019;t introduce him to Abbot Fangci,&#x201D; you mutter, and Xuzhan lets out a strangled, choking noise, his face almost turning green. &#x201C;Nevertheless, this is a pleasant surprise,&#x201D; you say. You look around at your guests. &#x201C;Now, it won&#x2019;t do to stand around gabbing outside the room. Xuzhan, you come in too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, I haven&#x2019;t started doing anything with them yet. It&#x2019;s safe,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;Besides, I spend so much time wandering about the <i>jianghu</i> thatwe barely have any chances to talk.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You lead them into the room. Yifang and Lingshu are instantly drawn to the cute toddler, engaging Pu&#x2019;er in conversation. Cao&#x2019;er seems entirely uninterested, keeping to her books as usual, while Yunzi and Armaiti keep sneaking peeks at the child although they do not make an approach. Xuezi seems rather annoyed at the intrusion, but makes no fuss for now. Qilin inserts herself by your side smoothly, sitting down on your right while she greets Guo Fu and his wife.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know you had a child already, Guo Fu. How old is he? Two?&#x201D; she asks.<br>
<br>
Guo Fu thinks for a brief second before he gives you the answer. &#x201C;Thereabouts, yes. He was born sometime after Heihu. It was a mess back then, with the Grand Taoist passing away.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He originally wanted to name our child after you if it was a boy, and to ask you to be his godfather,&#x201D; says Pu&#x2019;er from the side as she watches Yifang and Lingshu attempt to play with her shy son.<br>
<br>
You tap your chin as you figure out the name. &#x201C;Guo Jing, eh? But you called him Chong&#x2019;er&#x2026; ah, did you name him after the Grand Taoist instead?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; nods Guo. &#x201C;This boy is Guo Zhengchong. I saw you at Heihu Valley, but was not able to talk to you. Afterwards, no one seemed to know where you were  and we could not find you to be his godfather. We decided it would be better to honour the departed Grand Taoist. Sorry.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not your fault. I had to disappear for a while. Training,&#x201D; you shrug, and Guo Fu relaxes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That explains it,&#x201D; he smiles. &#x201C;To be honest, I was a bit worried.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You need not have been,&#x201D; admonishes Pu&#x2019;er. &#x201C;Unlike you, Xu Jing knows how to take care of himself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you really think that?&#x201D; laughs Qilin, and the two females share a look of commiseration and instant understanding.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Anyway,&#x201D; you say hastily, eager to change the topic before the wives begin gossiping, &#x201C;what brings you here, Fu?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I brought a missive from Master Daoshi for the Abbot,&#x201D; says Guo Fu jovially. &#x201C;As for what it&#x2019;s about&#x2026;&#x201D; He seems rather hesitant to reveal it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think I may know what it&#x2019;s about,&#x201D; offers Xuzhan, seemingly glad to be able to contribute to the discussion. &#x201C;The Eight Sects aren&#x2019;t getting along too well nowadays, right? After Grand Taoist Wang and Abbot Fangzhang met their untimely demise. Well, a monk shouldn&#x2019;t gossip, I know that, but from what I hear, Master Nie of Huashan might be planning something at the upcoming Huashan Summit.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;When isn&#x2019;t he planning something?&#x201D; you snort.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good point,&#x201D; nods Xuzhan. &#x201C;But whatever it is, Taoist Daoshi, Abbot Fangci and Abbess Miaozhu are being cautious of Master Nie and his allies at the moment. In fact, some of the elders seem to be suggesting that we do not participate in the Summit at all.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is what Master Daoshi is suggesting,&#x201D; admits Guo Fu finally. &#x201C;He thinks it would give Master Nie legitimacy. I don&#x2019;t understand why.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
To you, it sounds like it is developing in a way rather reminiscent of Imperial politics. What a pain.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If they participate, and Nie Wuxing comes out ahead, his domination over the entire <i>wulin </i>would become official.&#x201D; Yunzi joins the conversation all of a sudden, sitting down on your left.<br>
<br>
Guo Fu stares at her, and something appears to click in his head. &#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; His eyes narrow, his demeanour tensing up. &#x201C;Jing, you know that-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know her,&#x201D; you nod. &#x201C;She is with me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D; That is all it takes to reassure him, it seems. Guo Fu returns your nod and his shoulders relax.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>That </i>part I do not really understand, Miss,&#x201D; says Xuzhan, looking away from Yunzi. It looks like he is rather weak to women. &#x201C;Is Master Nie not already the leader of the Eight Sects?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He still does not command the same respect as the Grand Taoist once did, I presume?&#x201D; says Yunzi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Eight Sects don&#x2019;t look united under him at the moment, and Old Nie knows that. Rather than going to each wayward sect and making them properly submit, he just needs to showcase his strength at the Summit. It saves time and is arguably easier,&#x201D; explains Qilin.<br>
<br>
Yunzi looks at her with a slight expression of dissatisfaction. &#x201C;Of course, he must be very confident in his skills if he thinks he will come out as the overall winner. That means Wudang, Shaolin and Emei are being cautious about letting it be decided with a simple tournament. You did not need to explain that, Miss Chi.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry for speaking where not needed. It looks like you&#x2019;ve done your homework on the orthodox sects, Yunzi. Very hardworking of you. What else have you gleaned? I&#x2019;m sure everyone is eager to find out about your insights, <i>Third</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If three of them do not participate in such an important tradition, it&#x2019;s clear that this will cause a rift in the Eight Sects. The loss of face alone would be a huge mark of disrespect towards Nie Wuxing, in his current role as leader. Don&#x2019;t think you are the only smart one around here, <i>First</i>,&#x201D; says Yunzi proudly and a little too fiercely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you for your&#x2026; insight,&#x201D; grins Qilin, and Yunzi turns red as she realized what she just called her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not participating would be tantamount to challenging Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s leadership,&#x201D; you say, attempting to defuse the tension that seems to be rapidly building up. &#x201C;Even if they do not participate, however, perhaps they may still show up to observe the tournament.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I agree, darling,&#x201D; says Qilin eagerly. &#x201C;If anyone wants to overthrow Nie Wuxing publicly, I think the best way to do so would be to challenge him right after he wins&#x2026; if he wins. Watching the fights would be a good start. Also, remember that the unorthodox sides will be attending too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Unorthodox sides? A scary thought just appeared in my mind,&#x201D; mutters Xuzhan, his face pale. &#x201C;What if the Fire Cult participates in the Huashan Summit?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Would they?&#x201D; Guo Fu glances at Yunzi, and she sneaks a look at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, that would be very scary indeed,&#x201D; you say calmly. &#x201C;But enough of this talk. These are matters for the leaders of the sects to decide, and we lowly juniors can only speculate uselessly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is getting far too out of hand,&#x201D; agrees Lingshu. She seems to have snuck up behind you sometime during the conversation, drawn by the topic. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll only know for sure when it happens... all this baseless conjecture might yet turn out to be wrong. By the way, Xu Jing, aren&#x2019;t you participating in the gauntlet tomorrow? Shouldn&#x2019;t you be resting?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Gauntlet?&#x201D; Guo Fu looks puzzled.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;To cut a long story, I&#x2019;m challenging the temple,&#x201D; you chuckle, earning a silent nod from Guo Fu that seems to say &#x2018;that explains it&#x2019;. &#x201C;Since you&#x2019;re here, Xuzhan, do you know anything about it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;I&#x2019;ll be part of the Thirty-Six Armored Warriors. <i>Please</i> go lightly on me, Young Master Xu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As the dawn arrives, you go over what you know about Shaolin Temple&#x2019;s gauntlet again. Xuzhan had spilled the beans where originally you would have had to wait for the Abbot to brief you right before the challenge begins.<br>
<br>
You would first have to face the Seventy-Two Wooden Mannequin labyrinth, where you had to maneuver your way through a field of wooden puppets set up to spin and assault the challenger. While normally they would be armed with nothing more than sticks, here lethal blades, spears and projectiles were part of the setup.<br>
<br>
Then, you would challenge the Thirty-Six Armored Warriors of Damo simultaneously, shield-bearing monks clad from head to toe in metal armor. Should you defeat them, you would move on to the Eighteen Bronze Arhat Formation, which you observed just yesterday. The difficulty would be high, but you would be less restricted than Xuxian was in his trial.<br>
<br>
Next would be the Nine Venerable Shaolin Elders, each of them a possible candidate for Abbot. They would be among the strongest, most experienced fighters in the temple despite their age.<br>
<br>
Finally, you would have to face the Abbot himself, Fangci.<br>
<br>
You are given time measured in a stick&#x2019;s worth of incense to complete the trial, although it <i>is</i> a rather big stick that should burn for quite a long time. At any time during the challenge, you are allowed to give up and admit defeat. <br>
<br>
The Abbot adds a word that surprises you, however, when you meet him in the morning. &#x201C;Most challengers do not go through this trial alone. They are allowed to pick a partner to share their burden. I thought it would be fair to let you know that, before you begin.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You already know what you are going to do.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You go through it alone. There can be no other way. It would take all the fun out of it if you had to share the challenge with someone else.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You go through it with a partner. Whether it is to help you, or to add spice to the challenge, if they are allowing you one, you will take up the offer.<br>

            <h3>四十三 · The Shaolin Gauntlet II</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Shaolin Gauntlet II</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;You monks <i>actually </i>built a pagoda just for a challenge you expected no one would take?&#x201D; you say in disbelief, looking at the five-storey, octagonal structure that towers over you.<br>
<br>
Fangci shrugs, his massive shoulders conveying perfectly his lack of concern about your thoughts. &#x201C;The Abbot of the time thought it would be good labour for the monks. You enter from here when you are ready.&#x201D; He gestures at the open iron doors of the pagoda. As you and Yunzi step inside, a novice monk lights up a large joss stick placed in a brazier near the doors &#x2013; when the incense burns down, the challenge is over.<br>
<br>
The doors close behind you as soon as you enter, but your eyes are glued to something else.<br>
<br>
The first floor of the pagoda is filled with wooden mannequins, sticking up from the floor like misshapen tree stumps. They are still for now, their vaguely humanoid shape disquieting in the silence. Rods of wood and metal protrude from each of the mannequins; though many of them are bare, blades, hammers and barbed flails can be found at the ends of some of the rods. In the dim, smoky interior of the pagoda, you can make out dark discolorations on the floor and the mannequins.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Blood?&#x201D; Yunzi wrinkles her nose.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Whoever was here last certainly found themselves all over the place,&#x201D; you say, as you look up towards the low ceiling. Large, rust-brown spatters have stained the wooden beams. At the other end of the room is the exit, a small stairway leading upwards.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How are the Abbot and the other monks going to get up to the upper floors? Are there ladders on the outside?&#x201D; asks Yunzi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know. They could just fly to the top using their <i>qinggong</i>,&#x201D; you venture.<br>
<br>
Yunzi chuckles. &#x201C;Alright, let&#x2019;s not waste any more time gawking.&#x201D; She takes a step forward.<br>
<br>
There is a loud, grinding noise, and the floor trembles. The mannequins begin to move &#x2013; creakily &#x2013; swinging from left to right in a jerky, halting motion. The barbed flails sway gently as they do so. Slowly, they begin to pick up speed, each mannequin turning at different intervals.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It looks like we are supposed to carefully negotiate our way past the mannequins by considering their timing in our movements, blocking or dodging when necessary,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
Yunzi stares as the mannequin closest to you whips around, its metal hammer rushing through the air at high speed. &#x201C;Blocking? Maybe you should give it a try first.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give her a smirk that you know she&#x2019;ll find irritating. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter, too afraid to make a go of it? Who was the one that <i>really </i>wanted to come along?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-it&#x2019;s not like I really wanted to participate in this with you! I just wanted to test my own skills &#x2013; I&#x2019;d have challenged it whether you  wanted to or not,&#x201D; she protests.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you say so, Holy Maiden. But you&#x2019;re right. I should give it a try first. If I make it past, I&#x2019;m leaving you here,&#x201D; you say lightly, hopping into the field of rotating wooden mannequins.<br>
<br>
The first strike arrives; two wooden rods, from the left and right at the same time. You block them with your forearms and struggle to keep your surprise down: the mannequins hit with enough force that any untrained person would have their bones broken in a flash. Exhaling, you deflect the blows and force the mannequins to turn away, moving past them and deeper into the room. The second attack comes again from the same angle, but the timing is different, as are the heights. You manage to slip past them, and then another, but the number of attacks increase rapidly the deeper you venture into the room. Soon, you find yourself unable to keep up; the flurry of blows from all sides threaten to overwhelm you, and you hurriedly retreat back to the entrance before you are hurt.<br>
<br>
Yunzi gives you a little smirk of her own, apparently pleased by your inability to pass this stage on your first try.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t <i>you </i>give it a try, then?&#x201D; you gesture, waving at the faceless mannequins in their ceaseless dance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;See, I&#x2019;ll do this the smart way,&#x201D; she grins. Then, she jumps. The ceiling is low enough that she cannot jump too high or too far, but deftly, she lands on top of the closest mannequin, expertly keeping her balance even during its violent rotations. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll just make it past by stepping on their heads! If you don&#x2019;t catch up, I&#x2019;ll leave you behind here, Xu Jing!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi makes short, nimble hops from mannequin to mannequin, steadily progressing across the room. Still, you recall the blood spatters on the ceiling, and it doesn&#x2019;t take long before your suspicions are confirmed. One of the mannequins makes a sudden turn, swinging its weapons upwards instead. With a surprised yell, Yunzi hops back. The ones behind are have also begun attacking vertically, the reach of their weapons passing dangerously close to Yunzi. Gasping, she zig-zags her way over the tops of the flailing mannequins, hopping as if her life depended on it.<br>
<br>
As she lands next to you, she mutters a long curse in Tujue. &#x201C;Stupid wooden dolls! What&#x2019;s with that sudden attack? That&#x2019;s not fair!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, it <i>is </i>pretty smart of the makers,&#x201D; you grin, earning yourself an angry, scornful stare from Yunzi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t make me throw you into the mannequins,&#x201D; she mutters, glancing at the wooden mannequins. &#x201C;Are you asking for a fight?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Here?&#x201D; You wonder if there could possibly be any reasons <i>not </i>to fight right here. &#x201C;I suppose it wouldn&#x2019;t be <i>fun </i>enough if we crossed in perfect peace and harmony, would it? Are you proposing a race?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you have enough guts to accept it.&#x201D; Yunzi&#x2019;s eyes scan the mannequins again &#x2013; you realize that she is attempting to observe the vertical movements of the mannequins. It looks like she&#x2019;ll make another try to cross the room by hopping over the mannequins.<br>
<br>
Her basic understanding of the concept behind this particular challenge is correct; you have come to the same conclusion &#x2013; probably &#x2013; after having a go at it and watching Yunzi&#x2019;s own attempt. This stage isn&#x2019;t called a labyrinth for nothing: there is quite likely a proper path through the mannequins, a path of least resistance. You had only met overwhelming attacks from the mannequins because you pushed through the center, disregarding the trail you were supposed to discover for yourself.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You won&#x2019;t waste time with guided paths. No matter how strange and fearsome they may seem, these mannequins are still made of wood. Something you can destroy. You will blaze your own path of destruction across the room by smashing all the mannequins in your way &#x2013; this method will be far riskier, but it&#x2019;s the fastest way for you to do it.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will follow Yunzi&#x2019;s lead and run across the top of the mannequins. Their vertical movements are less frequent than their horizontal swings &#x2013; it will probably be quicker and safer to cross the room in this manner, rather than relying on a ground path. You would just have to use your <i>qinggong </i>wisely to avoid getting hurt.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You attempt the challenge the way the maker intended; you will calmly observe the patterns of the mannequins&#x2019; rotation, and identify the best path through the dangerous room step by step. It will take a lot more time than the other methods, but there is no guarantee that the other methods will be successful, and you would rather take the slow, steady way.

<br>
Step by step, you test the labyrinth of mannequins, advancing and retreating according to the patterns you discover. The maker had been particularly devious &#x2013; there were paths that only opened up at set intervals, and countless dead ends. It would be easy to take a bit more of a risk, and push further&#x2026; but that is not your intention. You block, duck, and maneuver your way past the mannequins, but never with any more effort than the absolute minimum necessary.<br>
<br>
Above you, Yunzi curses as she is flung back towards the starting point again by a particular pest of a mannequin. You laugh. &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you join me down here? It is far less stressful.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shut up! I&#x2019;ll get past this my own way!&#x201D; she retorts.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Suit yourself,&#x201D; you call out, as you swiftly roll under a whistling blade and use both your arms to stop two mannequins from swinging their sticks at your head.<br>
<br>
Moments later, Yunzi shouts out. Turning your head to look at her, you see her smash the offending mannequin with an overhead kick, splintering it. Leaping off the broken lump of wood, she swiftly makes her way towards the other side, adeptly dodging any attacks coming her way. Seconds later, she kicks off the last of the mannequins, reaching the exit without a single scratch.<br>
<br>
Yunzi laughs happily. &#x201C;I won, slow-poke! See you at the top!&#x201D; she shouts out, before running up the stairs.<br>
<br>
Unperturbed at her triumph, you continue progressing through the maze at your own pace. There are still plenty of hours to go, and the true path is a rather fiendish matter to uncover. From time to time you hear sounds of battle fading in and out from the floors above. Deep in concentration, you lose yourself in unravelling the wooden mannequin labyrinth, and ignore those noises. As you near what seems to be the end, there is a loud bang, and the pagoda itself seems to tremble.<br>
<br>
Then, you finally clear the maze. As soon as you step foot outside of the field of mannequins, they gradually draw to a halt, their vicious movements winding down into stillness. Soon, it is as if they had never moved. Casting one last look at the room, you venture up the stairs, taking it one step at a time.<br>
<br>
The second floor is empty, except for the occasional discarded shield, their surfaces charred. The floor and walls are marked with signs of battle; here and there you see signs of Yunzi&#x2019;s characteristic moves. Some of the sturdy wooden pillars holding up the pagoda have cracked. Taking no more than a second to look around, you move on to the next floor.<br>
<br>
As your head clears the stairs, the first sight that greets you is that of an open sky. A large section of the wall is missing. The scars of battle on this floor are even fiercer, though it is as devoid of any people as the last level. Walking towards the large hole, you peer out of it and down. Bald heads shining in the sun are milling about, cleaning up the debris that seems to be all that remains of the wall that fell. This must have been the loud noise that you heard while you were still on the first floor. Did the Eighteen Arhats do it, or was Yunzi responsible? Either way, since no one is here at the moment, you move on to the fourth floor.<br>
<br>
As you ascend the stairs, you hear loud cheering. Then, a calm voice speaks. &#x201C;It looks like the representative has acknowledged her defeat. There is still some time left before the trial ends, but if the other challenger does not appear soon, perhaps we may judge this challenge over.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And here I was thinking that I was finally going to have my fun,&#x201D; you say dejectedly, appearing from the stairs to the surprised gasp of the crowd. Cao&#x2019;er shouts out your name when she sees you. Everyone seems to be here &#x2013; Qilin and the other girls, Guo Fu and his family, a battered-looking Xuzhan, and an entire contingent of monks, though the Abbot himself is absent - they must have moved from floor to floor to spectate the fights. You had caught sight of a winding stairway around the outside of the pagoda on the floor below that they could have used to climb this far. Perhaps they hadn&#x2019;t viewed the first stage simply because there was no room on that floor for this many people, with whatever space available being taken up by lethal wooden mannequins.<br>
<br>
Yunzi is sitting on the floor next to the stairs, bruised and exhausted. She seems unhurt otherwise, but she is in no shape to continue at the moment. Her eyes bore into you viciously as she lets out a long litany of Tujue curses at the very sight of you. &#x201C;You&#x2026; you feckless dog!&#x201D; she spits, &#x201C;You let me go ahead just so I could take out the fighters in your way, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You grin. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t actually expect you to defeat them so thoroughly. So, how did you like the fights I let you have?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi scowls fetchingly. &#x201C;&#x2026;I am going to <i>kill</i> you after this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll have to get in line, my dear Holy Maiden. First, I need to deal with the Shaolin elders that so easily defeated you. How scary are they?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Figure it out yourself. I could have beaten them if I hadn&#x2019;t had to defeat fifty people before making it here,&#x201D; sulks Yunzi. &#x201C;Maybe.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
That &#x2018;maybe&#x2019; at the end tells you plenty: the elders are not easy prey.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good job holding out this far,&quot; You cannot resist giving Yunzi a mocking pat on the head while she is vulnerable. She tries to push you away feebly, her face burning a fiery red.<br>
<br>
&quot;I&apos;ll <i>really </i>kill you, Xu Jing,&quot; she whispers angrily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well then!&#x201D; You turn away from Yunzi, ignoring her words gleefully in a way that you are sure is going to make her even more dissatisfied, and face your opponents: the Nine Venerable Shaolin Elders. This would be your last obstacle before reaching the Abbot; nine wrinkled old men with beards reaching down to their waist. All of them are unarmed, and they stand as still as statues with one hand raised to the front of their chest as if in prayer. You are not about to be taken in by their innocuous, saintly demeanour&#x2026; they likely have skill to match that of the Eighteen Arhats at least. If they were strong enough to make Yunzi &#x2013; even if she is already exhausted &#x2013; admit defeat, you cannot underestimate them. Thanks to her, however, you have arrived here without a single drop of sweat: you are still in perfect condition.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you ready, young master?&#x201D; speaks the elder in the center &#x2013; you recognize his voice as the one that had been talking right before you appeared. The monks around you hush up, falling silent as you walk up to the elders.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who can say? Readiness is a state of profound understanding, elder,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
He frowns, his white eyebrows scrunching up. &#x201C;I do not understand.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, neither do I,&#x201D; you say, giving absolutely no hint of what you are about to do as you throw the first punch while they least expect it.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will take pride in your own skill and techniques, and demonstrate it to these elders. Using what you have learnt in these past few years of training and travelling the <i>jianghu</i>, you will beat the nine elders solely with your sheer combat ability, proving that your youthful martial arts is stronger than Shaolin&#x2019;s elderly experience. It might not be the easiest way to go about it, but it will be a good test of your repertoire in a straight fight.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You unleash Wuxiang Qiankun upon them. Even the strongest of the elders here only have inner strength matching yours; given the wide variety of Shaolin techniques you can expect to be thrown at you in the next few seconds, this is a good chance to witness as many techniques as you can while at the same time defeating them with their own moves. You might even be able to use those moves against the Abbot later.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You quickly lure and bait all of them into a contest of inner strength with you. Then, you will simply take that chance to surprise them and drain the nine elders simultaneously. You will take in their <i>qi</i>, weakening them enough until they give up and award you the victory. At the same time, their contribution will boost your strength for the final confrontation with Abbot Fangci, as you progress to the next stage while being in an even better condition than before.

            <h3>四十五 · The Shaolin Gauntlet IV</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Shaolin Gauntlet IV</span></b><br>
<br>
The elders react with surprising sprightliness for their age, leaping into action without further hesitation. You trade blows with them, barely darting past their constant attempts to surround you and stomp you into the floor: some of the moves used by these old baldies are downright inelegant and reminiscent of a street brawl in their ruthlessness and effectiveness. Blocking an attempted eye-poke with the edge of your palm, you call out, &#x201C;Hey, what happened to Shaolin pride?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Pragmatism in moderation, as in all things, young master,&#x201D; says the elder with a profoundly cryptic air; never mind that he had just attempted to jab his fingers into your eyes. You retaliate with a swift kick, swinging your foot upwards into his groin. He lets out a battle cry as your kick lands&#x2026; to no discernible effect. Sensing danger approaching from behind you, you duck, just in time as a chair &#x2013; now <i>where </i>did they get that? &#x2013; whizzes over your head. You somersault over the heads of the monks behind you, taking a chance to get away from the melee.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is this the famed martial arts of Shaolin?&#x201D; you ask, laughing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We only thought we would show you the courtesy of fighting at your level, young master,&#x201D; says one of the elders innocently as he swings a short ladder by its legs.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not what I&#x2019;m here for,&#x201D; you grin, as they charge at you again. Fist, foot, ladder, chair and a surprisingly large table that must have appeared by some mystical Shaolin technique fly at you. In between moves, you begin talking to them. &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t what I came here to see, elders. Don&#x2019;t tell me this is all Shaolin is capable of?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What <i>do </i>you want to see then, young master?&#x201D; one of them asks patiently as his fists swing down in a vicious blur that would have broken your shoulders had you not scrambled out of the way at the last minute.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The temple&#x2019;s strong <i>neigong </i>cultivation, for starters.&#x201D; They pounce upon you as one, but you draw both palms back; gathering your <i>qi</i>, you use the sixth move of the Xianglong Palms &#x2013; the Fierce Dragon Crosses the Great Rivers &#x2013; with both hands, thrusting your palms forward with great force. The strong pressure of your <i>qi</i> is sufficient to push all nine elders away, their cloth shoes skidding across the wooden floorboards.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We see. You have made your point, young master,&#x201D; they speak, when you do not take advantage of the opening to launch any attacks upon them. &#x201C;Let it be so. We shall test your inner strength and see if it matches up to Shaolin&#x2019;s level. Please do not shed tears if you lose.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You had thought that they would try to do so one at a time and require more prompting from you, but surprisingly, the old monks come all at once, flying into the air around you and slamming their palms down from up high, as if attempting to squash a bug. You respond with a roar, striking back with your own open palms. &#x201C;Now <i>that&#x2019;s</i> more like it, you wrinkled baldies!&#x201D; The backlash from the clash of <i>neigong </i>generates a small shockwave that blows outward, forcing the spectators to take a few steps back.<br>
<br>
You grit your teeth, your arms trembling. The combined force of their <i>qi </i>is strong &#x2013; strong enough that they would likely overwhelm you in minutes if you tried to stay the course and hold out. Thankfully, that is not your aim.<br>
<br>
With no warning, you let their <i>qi </i>flow into you without opposition, transforming hard strength into soft compliance. As your chaotic <i>qi </i>melds with theirs, the process of absorption begins. It is not perfect; a good part of the foreign <i>qi </i>is dissipated, but you still devour enough to gradually increase your own strength.  A few seconds later, the elders begin to realize that something is wrong.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is&#x2026; it is as if we are pouring energy into nothingness. Brothers, pull back!&#x201D; shouts one of the elders.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-I can&#x2019;t!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The current is too strong; we are getting carried away with it!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You give them a wide grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This&#x2026; You&#x2026; Man Tiger Pig!&#x201D; yells an elder as he struggles. &#x201C;Where did you learn this ability?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;People keep calling me a thief, and so one day I woke up being able to steal <i>qi </i>from others. It must be a curse from Heaven,&#x201D; you reply.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait, my brothers, don&#x2019;t panic! We know how to deal with this!&#x201D; cries out another one.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, it&#x2019;s just been too long, that&#x2019;s all. A steady mind, brothers. A steady heart. Steady the flow.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As one, they close their eyes, focusing their minds.<br>
<br>
Instantly, before you can have any thoughts of breaking off the link, the flow of <i>qi </i>reverses direction. You glance around at the elders, their faces scrunched up in deep concentration. It is not absorption &#x2013; they are just highly skilled at manipulating the flow of internal energy. You are not sure what they did, but perhaps they have reversed the direction of their own meridians&#x2026; a highly complicated and risky maneuver. It would certainly explain the behaviour of the flow. The draw grows stronger away from you as they attempt their reversal. It looks like they are willing to take in your chaotic <i>qi </i>if it means weakening you at the same time, and divided amongst nine people, they would certainly find more advantages from doing so than disadvantages. They could have shut off the flow with their mastery, forcing you back into a straight fight, but it looks like they have decided to use your own ability against you instead.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is punishment for your misdeeds,&#x201D; recites one of the elders as if reading your thoughts. &#x201C;Your own pride will be your undoing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, but if I&#x2019;m to be punished, I&#x2019;d rather it be at the hands of beautiful young maidens wielding whips. Not shrivelled old prunes like you. I do not mean to offend but&#x2026; well, it just isn&#x2019;t going to work out between us.&#x201D; You part the chaos of your being and create order. As the streams separate into pure <i>yin </i>and <i>yang</i>, the elders&#x2019; eyes fly open in shock at this new sensation. In this form, your control over your own <i>qi</i> is almost absolute. The torrent of <i>qi </i>reverses direction yet again, as you entwine and draw it back in just the right way to <i>counter </i>their countermeasure.<br>
<br>
At this point, you cannot help but laugh maniacally as your <i>qi </i>re-enters your body and collapses back into turmoil, bringing with it a large stream of fresh sustenance which you feed off.<br>
<br>
The elders grow visibly weaker with the strain of trying to hold back the flow, beads of sweat running down the crevasses of their skinny, aged faces. Their lips pale, trembling as they begin chanting sutras.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, you realize that going any further would endanger their lives. You bring the process to a close, cutting off the link between you and the elders; earlier than you planned to, and leaving them with enough energy to continue the fight should they choose. They fall to the floor, sinking to their knees in small puddles of sweat. Stepping back from the circle of nine, you smile at them as you flex your fingers, marveling at the amount of energy overflowing from your body. &#x201C;Thank you for the gift, elders. I will put it to good use.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-you are welcome, young master,&#x201D; gasps one of them, clutching his chest.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you okay? I hope your heart isn&#x2019;t giving out on you,&#x201D; you ask with concern.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, it is fine.&#x201D; Closing his eyes, he brings his hands together in prayer and bows. His brethren follow suit. It looks like they have realized the mercy that you displayed and acknowledged your victory. Certainly, if the fight had continued after you stopped the drain, you would have still have won &#x2013; though probably at the cost of exhausting the extra energy you earned &#x2013; but they would have paid an even greater price for that victory. It would have put you in a worse position for the next stage, however, and if they weren&apos;t willing to sacrifice...<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You must be thinking that we are cowards for giving up here?&#x201D; smiles one of them suddenly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-what? No, of course not,&quot; you deny awkwardly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Pragmatism in moderation, young master,&#x201D; he repeats. &#x201C;We will leave the rest in the Abbot&#x2019;s hands.&#x201D; Then, he turns away, filing off to the side with the other elders. It seems that if Shaolin has any questions to interrogate you with, it will be after the gauntlet is over. The crowd parts way, clearing the path to the next set of stairs. Most of the monks are engaged in intense conversation with each other, as they debate the minutiae of the fight that they have just seen like rabid, fight-obsessed maniacs. Then again, they <i>are </i>members of a temple with nothing to enjoy except Buddhist sutras and martial arts. You are not exactly surprised.<br>
<br>
Before you head up the stairs, you look back over your shoulder. Yunzi is standing there, hands on her hips, looking extremely displeased and perhaps just a little frustrated.<br>
<br>
You wonder&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You share your<i> qi </i>with Yunzi and ask her to fight in the final stage together with you. The process will not be too efficient, and the wasted <i>qi </i>means that the two of you combined will be facing the Abbot with noticeably less energy than you alone would have if you ventured on by yourself, but still&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do not share your <i>qi </i>with Yunzi. It would be smarter and easier to handle this alone: with the high amount of <i>qi </i>reserves currently flowing through you, you think you would be able to match the Abbot blow for blow even if he goes all out.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You grab Yunzi and donate your <i>qi </i>to her. With a kiss. A <i>long</i> kiss. In front of everyone. The mouth-to-mouth method is more efficient than the traditional hand-to-back method (but not by much). At least, that is your justification. It is definitely an insane thing to do. You can&apos;t even finish listing the repercussions in your mind, so why are you still doing it?

            <h3>四十六 · The Shaolin Gauntlet V</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Shaolin Gauntlet V</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; Yunzi&#x2019;s demeanour is challenging and hostile as you walk up to her. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you have a gauntlet to complete?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You scratch at your brow, wondering how to go about this. In part, seeing her standing there like that made you feel a bit guilty about sending her ahead, but would it mean anything to try and make up for that now? You shake your head lightly. &#x201C;No. I mean, yes. I just thought it would be rude to leave my partner behind.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She narrows her eyes suspiciously, glaring at you. &#x201C;Very funny, Xu Jing. I made the mistake of leaving <i>you </i>behind, yes. No need to rub it in, <i>partner</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t want to continue the fight, then? I mean, it&#x2019;s a shame, all this power I borrowed from the elders&#x2026; I might not even be able to use it all&#x2026;&#x201D; You turn away, letting your words trail off.<br>
<br>
When you take a quick peek back, Yunzi seems to be thinking about it quite seriously.  &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to beg-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m offering it. Because I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;When are you <i>ever </i>sorry?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am now. I should have let you know upfront that you were just fodder, bait for them to waste their strength on.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Funny, I was planning on having you do the same. I just didn&#x2019;t think you would fail to catch up to me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t <i>fail</i>, I let you go ahead. Now I&#x2019;ll need you to go up there and block that bald muscle-freak&#x2019;s blows for me. You have potential as a human shield, so you are going to take my <i>qi</i> whether you like it or not and put it to good use.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Weren&#x2019;t you offering it freely?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I changed my mind. You are more useful than I realized.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;the second&#x2026; no, <i>third</i> thing I&#x2019;m going to do after restoring myself is to make you eat dirt. Alright, give it to me, if you are prepared for the consequences.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You step forward, preparing to transfer your <i>qi </i>into Yunzi. A sudden, inexplicable impulse strikes you as you lay your hands on her shoulders, and you lean in for a kiss.<br>
<br>
The whistling of the air warns you to duck as Yunzi&#x2019;s arm sweeps the space where your head had just been.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-w-what are you trying to do, you brute?&#x201D; she shouts.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the most efficient way to transfer <i>qi</i>,&#x201D; you say lamely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who are you trying to kid? Xu Jing, you-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He&#x2019;s right, young lady.&#x201D; One of the elders interrupts, a beatific look on his face. &#x201C;It is the best and quickest way, though of course forbidden to us monks. Go on, please. Do not mind us. We will just be here like we aren&apos;t, more ethereal than the whispers of the wind. Our gaze is as nothingness. It will not matter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The elder is right, mistress.&#x201D; Armaiti sees fit to add to the discussion, a grin on her face. &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re serious about winning, this is the best way to go about it.&#x201D; You look at Qilin and Cao&apos;er - Qilin flashes you a quick smile and a nod, as if to say, &quot;Go for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I see.&#x201D; Yunzi takes a deep breath once, twice, and looks down at the floor. &quot;That makes sense, right?&quot; she whispers. You cannot see her face clearly, but the tips of her ears have turned rather red. Without even giving you a single glance, she says, &#x201C;O-okay. Just make it quick.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You put your hands on her shoulders again, using Wuxiang Qiankun to synchronize your breathing and <i>qi </i>with hers, but this time it feels different. You hesitate. You have second thoughts about this. Now that you think about it, you are not sure why you tried that method in the first place, and if it is the right thing to do-<br>
<br>
Yunzi&#x2019;s hands fly up to your cheeks, grabbing them hard, and pull you down.<br>
<br>
You do not resist.<br>
<br>
When it is done, she wipes her lips, glaring scornfully at you. &#x201C;You were taking too long, you idiot! I said to make it quick, didn&#x2019;t I? Did you enjoy having me stand there, embarrassed, on purpose?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Turning away in a huff, Yunzi runs up the stairs to face the final challenge. You slap your heated cheeks and go after her &#x2013; you won&#x2019;t be letting her get first dibs at battling the Abbot.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You arrive at the top of the pagoda together with Yunzi, and the audience follows shortly after. Abbot Fangci is sitting in the middle of the empty floor, his legs crossed and his hands placed together in a calm meditation pose. He appears to be snoring.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps we can get the jump on him,&#x201D; whispers Yunzi, and you nod.<br>
<br>
Still, an eye flicks open as you approach cautiously. Not so off-guard after all. &#x201C;Here sooner than I expected, and with company too. I thought you would have reached the final stage alone.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m like a rabbit, Abbot. I&#x2019;d die of loneliness.&#x201D; You stop a few arm&#x2019;s lengths away from the Abbot, waiting for him to get up. He does so, but sluggishly, as if awakening from a long slumber. Drawing up to his full height, he stretches his arms, joints popping loudly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Under the skin of the rabbit lies a ferocious tiger, I feel.&#x201D; His stance is calm yet powerful &#x2013; the Abbot&#x2019;s confidence seems unshaken by your arrival here. &#x201C;How will it be? One at a time? Or do you plan on attacking me together?&#x201D; Fangci&#x2019;s question is as directed to you as it is to Yunzi, who has circled around behind him while you stood in front of him.<br>
<br>
Yunzi&#x2019;s answer is quick and simple. She attacks, her fist hurtling towards the back of the Abbot&#x2019;s shaven head. He steps aside, the passage of her arm barely grazing his ear, and swiftly brings his elbow up behind him and into her abdomen. Seeing the move coming, Yunzi spins in mid-air, avoiding the worst of it. Before she has landed, you have already moved forward, attempting to strike the Abbot while his attention is still on her. Your claws swing towards him, but he has read your intentions and strikes your arms with his own; the power behind his blows push your attacks away, rendering you unable to land a clean hit.<br>
<br>
With a shout, Yunzi leaps off the floor right upon landing, throwing a powerful spinning kick towards the Abbot&#x2019;s neck. At the same time, you unleash a quick flurry of claw attacks, attempting to overwhelm him. His expression changes: he blocks your first three moves but not the fourth, as he is forced to defend himself from Yunzi&#x2019;s kick. The Abbot&#x2019;s right hand flies up &#x2013;  grabbing her ankle before the kick lands &#x2013; while your fingers graze his raised left forearm, leaving behind nothing more than red welts as you scratch his skin. You prepare to follow up your attack with the powerful Bloody Diamond Horn &#x2013; perhaps <i>that </i>will be sufficient &#x2013; but a curtain of cloth blocks your view.<br>
<br>
Fangci spins rapidly, his cassock floating into the air, as he sends Yunzi swinging into you. You manage to catch her in your arms and not with your face, the force of the Abbot&#x2019;s swing sending the both of you hurtling backwards. Stamping your foot down, you stop your momentum, the wooden floorboards cracking loudly. As the dust settles, you see the Abbot looking at you with eyebrows raised: &#x201C;Is that all?&#x201D; his expression seems to say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How long are you planning on holding me like this?&#x201D; mutters Yunzi quietly.<br>
<br>
With a quick apology, you release her, though the outburst you are expecting from her does not come. Instead, she says, &#x201C;How are we going to approach this? He is not an easy target. He has not even exerted half of his power, I would say.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You have to agree. &#x201C;I guess we will have to continue fighting together. One of us will have to lead, while the other keeps up and responds. Fangci is too sharp to leave any flaws for us to exploit if we do not cooperate that way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I agree. I should lead. You just need to keep up with me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Then, you realize that the both of you have reached a point of contention: she wants to lead. So do you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You allow Yunzi to lead. You would fare better using your strength at opportune moments, waiting to strike precisely when she opens up holes in Fangci&#x2019;s defence with her agility and speed.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You insist on leading. Your greater strength allows you to go toe-to-toe with Fangci, at least more successfully than she would, and pry open his defence upon which her greater speed can exploit it.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You use Wuxiang Qiankun and fully attune yourself with Yunzi&#x2019;s <i>qi </i>and movements. Once you have slipped into her flow, the two of you might be able to move as if you are one mind in two bodies. It is something untried, something that Xuezi spoke of only in passing, but perhaps it would be a superior form of teamwork.

            <h3>四十七 · Gauntlet&#039;s End</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Gauntlet&#x2019;s End</span></b><br>
<br>
You place a hand on Yunzi&#x2019;s shoulder and close your eyes. She does not shrug it off, seeming to understand your intention. You seek for the movement of <i>qi</i>, feeling its flow through your body and hers &#x2013; a force that is alive, pulsating and beating &#x2013; and you match your breathing to hers. Rising. Falling. You can feel Yunzi tremble slightly as she too senses your <i>qi</i>: the process made easier by the infusion you performed earlier. Expertly, you pull the two disparate flows in two different bodies into sync, mirroring her inner strength with yours.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm, is that&#x2026;?&#x201D; You hear Abbot Fangci speak, but he makes no move to disturb you. The sound of a heartbeat fills your ears, but you are no longer sure whether it is that of yours or Yunzi&#x2019;s. Perhaps it makes no difference now.<br>
<br>
You open your eyes &#x2013; it is now complete. Yunzi gives you a glance. <i>Stop wasting time</i>. There is no more need for words between you both. You nod, and begin the fight anew.<br>
<br>
Fast as the Abbot is, he still cannot keep up. You move in perfect synchronicity with Yunzi, constantly exchanging positions and launching attacks at a speed that he cannot fully follow. As he is driven back, blocking what he can and evading what he cannot, you can feel that he is gradually increasing the amount of effort he is putting forth. Leaping back, he sends out a flurry of punches that you meet with your own fists. Knuckles slam against knuckles with equal ferocity for a brief second before Yunzi&#x2019;s continued attack distracts him, forcing the Abbot to break away.<br>
<br>
The fight continues, for perhaps what must be hundreds of moves, as Fangci utilizes his overwhelming advantage in experience to make up for his inferiority in reflexes and agility so that neither you or Yunzi manage to strike him cleanly &#x2013; though he too is unable to land a hit in return. Then, he slips up.<br>
<br>
He attempts to kick out at you, but without being asked, Yunzi intercepts his foot with her palm, knocking his leg away. There&#x2019;s your opening. You slam a fiery fist into the Abbot&#x2019;s stomach. At first it feels like punching iron, but it gives way after a second, and Fangci flies back, a smoking hole in the front of his robes. Laughing, he rips off the top and stamps on the smouldering cloth, leaving him clad only in his trousers. The monks immediately flee for the stairs. &#x201C;I would be grateful if you do not begin to aim for my pants, Xu Jing. Still, that is a very troublesome technique you have there. Which of the Shaolin martial arts should I use to counter this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Fangci closes his eyes, apparently thinking of a technique to use, but you and Yunzi have no intentions to let him recover. The two of you spring at him, attempting to finish the fight once and for all.<br>
<br>
The Abbot&#x2019;s eyes snaps open, and he claps his palms together in front of his chest, upright, as if praying to the Buddha. A powerful force stops your charge in its tracks &#x2013; in fact, it flings you backwards, sending you slamming against a wooden pillar. Your concentration breaks &#x2013; the link you have with Yunzi snaps as your <i>qi </i>dissolves back into chaos. The backlash causes your senses to fall into confusion: this technique is a double-edged sword, it seems. Besides you, Yunzi suffers the same fate, while a large palm print has appeared on the wall behind you, apparently blasted into the wood. At the same time, you vaguely perceive that Fangci is in front of you. He has finally managed to corner you. &#x201C;You caught me,&#x201D; you grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So I have. Don&#x2019;t bite your tongue now.&#x201D; Two stone-like fists embed themselves in your torso. The force of his punch presses your entire body back up against the pillar, having nowhere else to go&#x2026; just for a short while. Fangci shouts, exerting his <i>neigong</i>. The pillar shatters. You fly through it, tumbling until you sprawl against the damaged wall, cracking it further. Groaning, you can feel that more than a few of your ribs are in bad shape. Any more fighting would really hurt you.<br>
<br>
The Abbot gives you no time to recover. He claps his palms together again. Here it comes. You brace for the impact: this time it is not as jarring as before, but the pressure of his attack blows the wall out behind you, and you along with it. As you tumble in the air, you use your <i>qinggong </i>to right yourself &#x2013; he&#x2019;d have known you would do so to avoid the worst of the fall, that sly old bastard. You throw out your arms, sending crimson silk flying to the pointed corners of the pagoda roof. Knots are tied, allowing you to arrest your fall, and ignoring the pain in your sides, you pull yourself back up with all of your strength.<br>
<br>
As you return to the floor you were at, you find Yunzi frantically attempting to avoid the Abbot&#x2019;s attacks. He does not seem to have noticed your return, as you launch yourself through the missing wall and right at him. Catching him off guard, you slash at him with your Shouwang Claws. The Abbot turns at the last moment, twisting in a way so that your fingers only manage to penetrate just under his ribs. He clamps his arm down, trapping yours. With his other hand he raises his fist.<br>
<br>
You meet it with a Bloody Diamond Horn, summoning what is left of your strength even as your ribs scream in protest. The two attacks meet, his fist slamming into the palm of your hand. Blood trickles forth as portions of the skin on Fangci&#x2019;s beefy arm rips from the force of your attack. Your arm almost buckles under the pressure, but you manage to hold out as you dig your fingers into the back of the Abbot&#x2019;s hand, enclosing his fist. He tries to pull away, but your grip is firm. You grin.<br>
<br>
Behind him, Yunzi&#x2019;s preparations are complete, as she stands in the stance of Xsaora Vairya&#x2019;s deadly technique.<br>
<br>
The strike comes faster than you expect, stronger than you expect. Strong enough, in fact, that despite Abbot Fangci absorbing the bulk of the attack with his body, the both of you smash through yet another wall, breaking through into the open, the world just a huge whirl spinning round and round. You hit a tree on your way down, slowing your fall, though the Abbot is not so lucky as he makes a big hole in the roof of the Shaolin kitchens.<br>
<br>
Hearing the panicked shouts of the cooking monks, you leap down, dropping into the kitchen to check on the Abbot. Hopefully he isn&#x2019;t dead.<br>
<br>
You find him lying on the floor, eyes closed and limbs spread-eagled. Without warning, he sits up, letting out a great big sigh. There is a trail of blood from the corner of his mouth: Yunzi&#x2019;s move had an effect. Dusting himself off, he gets to his feet while brushing off the younger monks&#x2019; attempts to help him up, wincing as he does so. &#x201C;You pass, Xu Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You have cleared the gauntlet, but you are not entirely satisfied with the outcome for some reason. &#x201C;I thought you said you were weaker than Fangzhang,&#x201D; you say. You rather suspect that anyone still moving after taking that sort of attack is on the level of a Great Pugilist.<br>
<br>
Fangci chuckles. &#x201C;But I am. Believe it or not, I am a worse Buddhist than he was, making my understanding of Shaolin techniques shallower than his. He may have had a weakness for food, drink, whoring and gambling, but all that is forgivable in comparison to my personal sins.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What could be worse?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are a smart boy. You can figure it out yourself.&#x201D; Groaning, he stretches his back. &#x201C;At any rate&#x2026; this is painful. We should get medical attention. That girl, too. Using such a move twice in a day should be quite stressful on her body.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
And with that, the challenge is over.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
There were many questions afterwards. The Abbot and the elders sat down with you for a celebration meal, although it seemed more like an interrogation. The food was pretty bad &#x2013; bland, though the monks did not seem to mind at all. You did, though.<br>
<br>
Of your <i>qi </i>draining ability, they thought that Master Zhang would have taught it to you: he would be the sort to have knowledge of such a skill even if he did not practice it himself. You do not correct their mistake.<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, they cared a bit less about Wuxiang Qiankun than you would have thought.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are not a disciple of the temple, and we cannot compel you to do anything. I <i>would </i>prefer it if you destroyed the manual, and took its knowledge with you to your grave, but the choice, in the end, is yours,&#x201D; said the Abbot. &#x201C;We can only hope that you use it wisely&#x2026; and that the turmoil over the manuals end soon before there is more bloodshed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
What they were more concerned over, however, was Yunzi&#x2019;s identity as the Holy Maiden of the Fire Temple. Ahura&#x2019;s attack was only two years ago &#x2013; hardly ancient history &#x2013; and very fresh in the minds of the orthodox world. The Shaolin monks stated clearly their worry of another attack. Of course, they would not do anything at the moment, but you can feel that they are wary of you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You hide your Lordship from Shaolin Temple. You claim that you are no ally of the fire cultists, that you are neutral, and that you will endeavour to guide Yunzi on the right path, so that she may in turn teach the Fire Temple to co-exist with the pugilistic community. You make no promises beyond that.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You reveal that you are the new Lord of the Fire Temple, and that you seek a friendship with Shaolin, whether unofficial or official, on behalf of your organization. You will attempt to broker an alliance, though it probably requires that you promise to conduct Fire Temple business in an upright, honourable manner.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As for the matter of Xuxian, the Abbot has allowed you to give your opinion. You talk to Xuxian for a while &#x2013; he tells you that he is content if he can live life peacefully after all this excitement. You can tell that he seems to be of two minds about it, however: he is not personally committed to either path yet. After thinking long and hard, you finally decide on an answer.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will bring Xuxian with you on your travels, and guide him best as you can. As a practitioner of Wuxiang Qiankun, you would be able to connect with him better than the Abbot could. You could use a helping hand on your journey, and he is a rather strong martial artist despite his flawed spirit.<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> Xuxian will remain at the temple, but not in confinement. He should be accorded the same rights as any of the other monks. You think it would be better if he spends some time in the peaceful environments of Shaolin Temple, rather than going on another dangerous trip so soon. You can always visit him or seek his help later if you really need it.

            <h3>四十八 · Libraries and Dumplings</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Libraries and Dumplings</span></b><br>
<br>
By the time you finish convincing the Shaolin elders that no, you <i>are not </i>lying about being the new Fire Lord, half of them have fainted and the other half were still choking on the food. Abbot Fangci has a look of grave concern. &#x201C;Keep this a secret for now, as best as you can,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Certain other sects would be less&#x2026; tolerant. This is a very sensitive issue. Still, you promise much, to claim that you can sway such a heretical cult to your bidding.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about it, musclehead,&#x201D; sighs Xuezi. &#x201C;Just keep your little friendship a secret for now, while you wait and see how the boy fares. It&#x2019;s not like we&#x2019;re asking you to go about announcing it with gongs and shouts.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose you are right, child&#x2026; but <i>why </i>are you in here, again?&#x201D; frowns Fangci.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Does it matter? Now that Xu Jing is won, he&#x2019;s allowed to be in the library, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, yes, but-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t beat around the bush. Yes or no?&#x201D; snaps Xuezi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xuezi cheers happily.<br>
<br>
The Abbot&#x2019;s face looks pale, as if concerned about something. It couldn&#x2019;t be fear, of course &#x2013; what has he to be afraid of in Shaolin? Looking at you with dead serious eyes, he says, &#x201C;Always, <i>always</i> listen to the Librarian. I cannot guarantee your safety if you don&#x2019;t.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Which librarian?&#x201D; You know that there are many in Shaolin, fierce guards of their library.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not a librarian, <i>the </i>Librarian,&#x201D; Fangci says urgently. &#x201C;Remember my words.&#x201D; You do not understand &#x2013; perhaps it is some Buddhist practice unique to Shaolin.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When you arrive at the library with Xuezi, it appears to be empty except for a wizened old monk in plain brown robes, hunched over as he sweeps the steps. He gazes at the two of you with clear eyes that belie his age. &#x201C;Ah, yes. The Abbot told me of your arrival. The Mistress of Tianshan, was it? And the disciple of little Yang. Or was it Zhang?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xuezi freezes up, clutching your hand tightly. &#x201C;Y-you&#x2019;re still alive? <i>He&#x2019;s still alive</i>, Xu Jing! Let&#x2019;s get out of here!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are not sure why she is so afraid of a sweeper monk when she felt no fear mouthing off to the Abbot and the other elders - or indeed anyone at all. You do not feel anything extraordinary from him&#x2026; though he seems to know her true identity. Did you reveal it to the Shaolin monks somehow? You are sure you hadn&#x2019;t. Restraining her as she tries to flee, you attempt to talk to the old monk. &#x201C;My master is a Zhang, old <i>qianbei</i>. Did you know him? For that matter, how do you know this child here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have seen many people come and go in my lifetime here,&#x201D; he grins, showing only a few teeth left in that aged mouth. &#x201C;But that is not a story for me to tell. I am the librarian.&#x201D; This must be the Librarian that Fangci spoke of.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But you&#x2019;re holding a broom, like a sweeper.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who better to take care of books than a person devoted to dusting them off? Shaolin&#x2019;s library is more ancient than I am by far, and requires more care than I do. Now, the Abbot has given you special dispensation to enter, although you are not monks...&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I managed to defeat the gauntlet and become a honorary member.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D; The old sweeper snorts dismissively with that grumpy tone all people of a certain age acquire, and continues, &#x201C;You are not allowed into the advanced section. Thirty minutes is the amount of time you have per day. I will come in and <i>fetch </i>you if you are not done by then.&#x201D; There is something about the way he says &#x2018;fetch&#x2019; that makes you feel uneasy. You do not argue with him about the time limit imposed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If he says thirty minutes, we should leave in twenty,&#x201D; hisses Xuezi anxiously, tugging at your sleeve. You wonder just who this decrepit old monk is.<br>
<br>
The Shaolin archives are stored within a large building with only one main entrance and exit. The air is surprisingly fresh &#x2013; you had expected it to be an old, dusty place. There are all sorts of documents lining the shelves that reach from floor to ceiling; bound books, wooden scrolls, and even scraps of leather strung together. Splitting up, Xuezi wanders off, her joy at seeing the books overcoming her fear of the Librarian. You look around &#x2013; you think you should bring Cao&#x2019;er here tomorrow. She would definitely love the place. Walking through the corridors made by the shelves, you spot a small pathway leading off to an annex.<br>
<br>
&#x2018;Advanced Shaolin Martial Arts&#x2019;, says a sign. You glance at the doorway; the librarian is still sweeping outside, his back to you. Perhaps you could sneak a peek. You turn around&#x2026; but he is already there, in your way with broom in hand. &#x201C;The books beyond here are off-limits to you, boy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You quickly turn your head back, towards the doorway again. It&#x2019;s not a twin. Returning your attention to the old monk, you laugh awkwardly. &#x201C;Right, that&#x2019;s right. I was just looking.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Look elsewhere. Perhaps you might want to try the sixth shelf on the left of you, fifth rack from the bottom,&#x201D; he suggests.<br>
<br>
Nodding nervously, you walk off, counting the shelves. Reaching the spot that the librarian suggested you check, you browse through the stacked records. Something immediately catches your eye. The history of the three legendary manuals, written down nearly seventy five years ago. You flip through it; it is a long tale of bloodshed, betrayal and chaos. Before you know it, the time is up, yet you have still not finished your reading. Xuezi pulls you out of the library under the watchful eye of the monk. You would have to come again tomorrow.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
At the end of your library visits, you are still no closer to discovering the location of the manuals, but you have learnt a few interesting matters. The Jiuyang manual moved about publicly for a while, before falling into Shaolin&#x2019;s hands and triggering a lengthy war between the orthodox sects that ended up with the manual purportedly going missing. The Jiuyin manual was known to be in possession of the immortal of Luoying Manor once upon a time. With the Manor being destroyed and its resident nowhere to be found, it would be hard to follow up on that lead, but perhaps the scholars that have moved to Taoying Island would have an idea. Furthermore, the writer of the records claims that the nameless monk that created Wuxiang Qiankun had taught parts of it to his friend before he disappeared into the Western regions &#x2013; and as it turns out, that friend of his would later go on to become the illustrious ancestor that brought the family of Zhang Manlou into prominence.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;More importantly of all, I learnt a way to unseal my powers temporarily!&#x201D; says Xuezi excitedly. &#x201C;But I can only do it once, maybe twice, since the strain of forcing all those meridian channels open would be too much even for me. But it&#x2019;s a start. At this rate I might not even need the Xuanming Jiuyin manual to restore myself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You&#x2019;re glad that she got something out of it, at least.<br>
<br>
Upon your request, Xuxian has been reinstated as a monk and assigned his tasks. He seems pleased to be working; in his own words, he is relieved that &quot;I don&apos;t need to think about martial arts for a while&quot;. The Abbot has also seconded him to the strange old librarian of the archives &#x2013; when you asked about that, it seems that the librarian made that request himself and Fangci was in no position to refuse. You bid Xuxian goodbye, but not before the grateful young monk passed you a small scroll listing down some instructions for the finger techniques he has learnt, hoping that it would be sufficient compensation for your aid. The Jiuyang manual&apos;s <i>neigong </i>technique was too complicated for him to pass on in writing, he whispered, but he hoped that you would do good in the world with the techniques he has given - at least, more good than he has done. You promised him that you would return to see him again, and that you could travel together once more when he&#x2019;s had enough of monastic life.<br>
<br>
Guo Fu is accompanying you as you depart from Shaolin: he would be representing Wudang at the Ten Swords Conference, as they would like to see just who it is that took their Qixing Longyuan sword. He would be meeting up with a few other Wudang disciples in Yangzhou, and so for now he and his family would be travelling with you. You had also sent out a letter to the Fire Temple by pigeon, informing them of what you have done so far in the Central Plains. A reply should arrive in less than a week.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Before you could leave, however, Qilin would not allow you to depart the region without visiting the restaurant with the best dumplings in Luoyang. Knowing a lost argument when you see one, you gave in to her. Besides, after the bland monastery food, you are hankering for some fragrant, tasty meat.<br>
<br>
As you enter the restaurant, your large entourage in tow, you see a few faces you know well.<br>
<br>
Zhang Jue is there, a plate of dumplings in front of him. He is sharing a table with Gao Ying, Xiaofang, <i>and</i> Shun himself, dressed in commoner clothing.<br>
<br>
You stare at the scene a few seconds, trying to make sense of it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh! What a coincidence,&#x201D; calls out Shun cheerfully when he spots you all frozen up at the entrance of the restaurant. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t expect to see you here, Jing. Come, join us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You flash a look at Master Zhang, who seems entirely unconcerned.  &#x201C;You&#x2026; ah, do know who you are sitting with, right?&#x201D; A question meant for the both of them. They nod. You are about to ask them just what they are doing here, together, but someone taps you on the shoulder. It&#x2019;s Armaiti.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That man is your master, right? The Southern Maniac?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, that is he.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perfect. I must apologize in advance, my lord.&#x201D; Muttering further apologies to Yunzi, who is looking extremely worried, she steps forward and gives Zhang Jue a slight bow. &#x201C;My name is Armaiti, of the Fire Temple of Gushnap. I am the young sister of my predecessor who fell at your hands at Heihu Valley. Zhang Jue, I challenge you to a duel to avenge her.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Well, you certainly didn&#x2019;t see <i>that </i>coming. Armaiti had not brought it up at all before this.<br>
<br>
Zhang looks up at the young woman, chewing the dumpling slowly. Then, he swallows, and grins ferally.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a yes,&#x201D; you whisper to Armaiti, &#x201C;but are you <i>sure </i>about this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She is very sure.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You can&#x2019;t have this fight. You stop her from fighting using your authority as Lord of the Fire Temple. You have a feeling that Armaiti will be extremely displeased at that, but you cannot risk her fighting Master Zhang at this time. She is strong, but you have no doubt that he is stronger. If he treats this as a duel to the death&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You tell Armaiti that before she challenges Zhang Jue, she must first prove herself by defeating his disciple. That would be you. You think she would respect you more if you stop her by strength rather than by word of authority, but Armaiti is powerful enough that you are not sure if you can win in the first place.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You challenge Zhang Jue alongside her, to give her a fighting chance. This is a perfect opportunity to show your master what you have learnt, and you know better than anyone how much he enjoys a good fight. Teaming up with Armaiti might even afford you the chance to be the one to beat him senseless for once&#x2026; probably. Maybe. You think.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You allow the duel to go on, as Armaiti wishes. This is vengeance for her sister &#x2013; you do not wish to interfere. You will just have to pray that Master Zhang is not in a killing mood and that you will be able to jump in to interfere in time if it looks like lives are going to be spent today.

            <h3>四十九 · Earthly Determination, Heavenly Will</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Earthly Determination, Heavenly Will</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Armaiti,&#x201D; you say patiently. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a certain order to these things in the Central Plains. You can&#x2019;t just go around challenging people like that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is in my sister&#x2019;s name.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Even so.&#x201D; You grab Armaiti&#x2019;s shoulders firmly and turn her around to face you &#x2013; the young woman looks fairly perplexed at your actions. &#x201C;You are supposed to challenge the disciple first. That would be me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Armaiti&#x2019;s eyes widen as she realizes the meaning of your words. Quietly, she mutters, &#x201C;That would be improper.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Vairya does not seem to share your opinion,&#x201D; you say cheerfully. You clap her shoulders twice for emphasis and look over at Master Zhang. &#x201C;I will be taking this fight from you, master.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can do as you wish, but if you do not finish the match by the time I finish my dumplings...&#x201D; Zhang Jue pops another dumpling into his mouth, unruffled by Armaiti&#x2019;s challenge. The plate is still piled full of them. &#x201C;Then, I would like an after-meal workout.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No problem,&#x201D; you say, looking at the frowning Armaiti. You laugh. &#x201C;Cheer up. It could be worse. My master could have a dozen more disciples for you to fight through to get to him. Besides, if you cannot even beat me, you do not stand a chance against him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Armaiti casts a glance at Yunzi, and then at you. &#x201C;It is not about winning, or even about living.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It looks like she does realize that defeating Zhang Jue at this moment is not very probable. You recalculate your approach. &#x201C;If you want to throw your life away, you need my permission to do so, do you not? Beat me and I will grant you that permission. Before that, however, you are still <i>my</i> Amesha Spenta.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The serious look on Armaiti&#x2019;s face relaxes, a flicker of embarrassment momentarily crossing her face before being wiped off by her usual, amiable grin. &#x201C;Alright then, my lord. If you want. I&#x2019;ll hold nothing back. If I beat you, I will have free rein to challenge your master at any time in the future.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If I win, you and Yunzi need to sit down with Yifang for some etiquette lessons.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey! Why drag me into this? And <i>you&#x2019;re </i>one to talk!&#x201D; shouts Yunzi angrily.<br>
<br>
You flash her a grin but otherwise ignore her as you leave the restaurant with Armaiti, heading for a more suitable spot that will not disrupt business&#x2026; well, at least not any more than you already have. Shun walks up next to you, looking decidedly amused. &#x201C;I will have Gao Ying clear out the square ahead. Just try not to destroy any buildings.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. My master isn&#x2019;t involved, so Luoyang should be safe.&#x201D; You think about Armaiti&#x2019;s techniques for a while, and add, &#x201C;Probably.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The fight ends with one dumpling left to go. With a time limit in play, you had gone all out from the start, and Armaiti was forced to respond. Your duel had left the square in ruins &#x2013; hopefully Shun will bill that to the Imperial Treasury, since he suggested the venue &#x2013; with long, deep cracks radiating along the pavestones as the scars of combat. In the end, you were forced to resort to Wuxiang Qiankun. Even knowing that you had that move in your arsenal, the sudden use of her own moves against her threw Armaiti off. It was but a split second, but you exploited that opening to hit her with a Shadowless Thunder Breaker.<br>
<br>
Panting and spent, you resist the urge to collapse on top of Armaiti as you stand over her body. Her defensive ability was easily on par with Shaolin&#x2019;s abbot and her strength was a match for yours. If you had been a bit less tricksier, this was a match that you would have lost. &#x201C;Well?&#x201D; you ask, looking down at her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I yield, my lord.&#x201D; Her eyes are closed, her breathing heavy. &#x201C;I cannot say that I am pleased that you decided to interfere, however. Why?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Complaining <i>after </i>the match? Not very seemly,&#x201D; you chuckle as you sink to your knees. &#x201C;You Amesha Spenta cast away your real names to take up the titles of holy spirits. You are supposed to behave as aspects of some divine being&#x2026; well, most of the time,&#x201D; you falter halfway, remembering Vahista crying and drinking his sorrows away. Shaking your head, you continue, &#x201C;That tells me that &#x2018;Armaiti&#x2019; is something&#x2026; no, <i>someone</i> important to the temple and its followers. Am I wrong?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why did you take up this mantle in the first place? For your sister, or for the temple? Would you serve the Holy Flame as a corpse or as a living being? Devotion is your role and the strength you contribute to me, and your devotion is as a guide to me, not I to you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After a moment of contemplation, she finally says, &#x201C;&#x2026;my lord, have you been reading the holy texts? Your speech sounds suspiciously familiar. You&#x2019;ve also got some parts of it wrong. For example-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You quickly interrupt her. &#x201C;W-well, the message is what&#x2019;s important.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Armaiti laughs. &#x201C;I get it. Just make those etiquette classes short, for the Holy Maiden&#x2019;s sake.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A shadow looms over you. Looking up, you see Master Zhang, holding an empty plate in his hand. &#x201C;The both of you displayed some <i>interesting </i>techniques,&#x201D; he says quietly. Then, he drags you up by the back of your clothes. &#x201C;Dear disciple, the memory of her techniques is still fresh in your mind, is it not?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, master, but-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;None of your bones are even cracked. You are clearly still in a condition to fight,&#x201D; he grins, and you feel the familiar rush of adrenaline returning, warmth suffusing your body in response to Master Zhang&#x2019;s bloodlust. Pushing yourself beyond your limits, fighting on when you thought you could not even stand anymore&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I bow to your superior knowledge of the human anatomy, Master&#x201D; you say wryly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Desperation brings out the best in you. You will be my after-meal entertainment, Jing,&#x201D; says Zhang simply as he releases you. You land, shakily, but somehow find it in yourself to keep your body upright. Walking a short distance away, Zhang takes a stance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My lord?&#x201D; asks Armaiti nervously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; you sigh. &#x201C;This is just how we do things on Maniac Island.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, why are you travelling with my master, Your Majesty?&#x201D; you sigh, wincing as Cao&#x2019;er treats your broken body in bed. Master Zhang had not let you go until you demonstrated all of the new techniques you had learnt on him, together with what Armaiti had used on you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Coincidence,&#x201D; smiles Shun. &#x201C;I bumped into him on my way down to Yangzhou. I must say, he is hard to miss.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Easy enough to miss him if he doesn&#x2019;t want to be seen,&#x201D; you groan, remembering all the painful times he had successfully snuck up on you while training in the thick forest. &#x201C;And you&#x2019;re going all the way to Yangzhou&#x2026; why?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;For the same reason as you, I suspect. Why else do you think I sent Xiahou Yu ahead?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I thought he was going there so that he could bring his wife around to meet her old colleagues. It was under orders from you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You say it like I&#x2019;m some tyrant controlling his personal life!&#x201D; Shun pretends to be offended and laughs. &#x201C;No, it was a matter of two birds with one stone. He and Miss Liu needed a short vacation away from the capital anyway, given that Zhang Manlou has been strutting around more and more recently. Yu would have found it hard to keep her from attacking that man.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not so over it, I see.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;People manage at different paces. Now, back to the subject of Yangzhou&#x2026; it is the Xuanyuan Sword I am after.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Afraid someone will take the throne from you?&#x201D; you tease.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, they can very well try, and if I lose the throne I never deserved to park my bum there in the first place. If someone has that sword, though, they must have taken it from the resting place of the First Emperor. That&#x2019;s grave robbery.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Punishable by death?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Death is the last punishment on the list, if that&#x2019;s what you mean,&#x201D; says Shun gravely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right. You know I&#x2019;m not too versed with the legal codes,&#x201D; you chuckle. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s just your excuse, though.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is,&#x201D; Shun admits, &#x201C;but this is an issue I would rather handle myself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It might get dangerous. One of the people who might be attending is Nie Wuxing, leader of the Huashan Sect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know who he is, and how he is in bed with the Zhang clan,&#x201D; says Shun rather dismissively. &#x201C;Do not worry. I think I will be alright. Besides, I have you around to protect me, right? What can go wrong?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You are surprised when Shun later indicates that he knows you used the Wuxiang Qiankun Skill to copy Armaiti&#x2019;s techniques. Citing a scholarly curiosity, he wonders if you will at least describe the basics of the technique to him, even if he does not have the foundations to learn it.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You describe the fundamental thought behind Wuxiang Qiankun to him.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You do not describe the fundamental thought behind Wuxiang Qiankun to him.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
It is not long before you leave Luoyang for Yangzhou. This time, your retinue has expanded to include the Southern Maniac as well, in addition to Shun, Gao Ying and Xiaofang. In an awkward turn of events, Guo Fu and his family had to be persuaded for a good half hour to raise their heads from the floor when they eventually found out about Shun&#x2019;s true identity. As you travel, you find more time to progress your study of martial arts&#x2026;<br>
<br>
*Pick two*<br>
<br>
I. You learn the Qingcheng Stab from Yifang, incorporating it into your self-taught technique with the Yuchang Sword. As her skill with it is perfect, watching her demonstration will likely gain you a perfect understanding of the technique.<br>
<br>
II. You learn the Qingzi Sword (&#x9752;&#x5B57;&#x528D;, Green Letter Sword) from Song Lingshu, a swift swordplay that is heavily focused on offense; it is said to be one of the quickest sword techniques in the jianghu. Designed to be used in conjunction with the Chengzi Step to form the Qingcheng Sect&apos;s famous Qingcheng Jianwu combination technique.<br>
<br>
III. You learn the Chengzi Step (&#x57CE;&#x5B57;&#x821E;, City Letter Step) from Song Lingshu, a defensive qinggong geared towards evading the attack patterns made by weapons, particularly those from the orthodox sects. Designed to be used in conjunction with the Qingzi Sword to form the Qingcheng Sect&apos;s famous Qingcheng Jianwu combination technique.<br>
<br>
IV. You learn the Liushen Shanshen Great Skill (&#x516D;&#x8056;&#x5584;&#x795E;&#x5927;&#x6CD5;, Spenta Ormazd Great Skill), from Yunzi and Armaiti &#x2013; this is the characteristic fiery neigong of the Fire Temple. Your qi will take on the characteristics of fire, augmenting the damage done by your attacks and burning your enemies.<br>
<br>
V. You learn the Dingdi Step (&#x5B9A;&#x5730;&#x6B65;, Earth-Stabilizing Step) from Armaiti, a technique that allows you to remain in an extremely stable, grounded stance while not losing an ounce of your usual speed. It will increase your defensive ability greatly when employed.<br>
<br>
VI. You learn the Xiongshi Violent Roar (&#x96C4;&#x72EE;&#x66B4;&#x543C;, Manly Lion&#x2019;s Violent Roar) from Zhang Jue, a <i>qi</i>-based technique that blows away the enemy with a loud roar. The strength of the move depends on the amount of <i>neigong </i>that you have.<br>
<br>
VII. You attempt to pick up Zhang Jue&#x2019;s Jinshe Baojun Fiery Eye (&#x91D1;&#x86C7;&#x66B4;&#x541B;&#x706B;&#x773C;, Fiery Eye of the Serpent Tyrant), an advanced technique that enhances perception and allows the practitioner to project <i>qi </i>from his eyes to immobilize or damage his opponent.<br>
<br>
VIII. You learn the Taiji Fist and Taiji Sword from Guo Fu, the signature Wudang techniques that are said to be the most profound and complete counter-attacking skills in the world. The principles of the two are interchangeable, and as such you would be able to train them together.<br>
<br>
IX. You practice the fundamentals of the Yiyang Finger (&#x4E00;&#x967D;&#x6307;, One <i>Yang </i>Finger), one of the finger techniques you obtained from Xuxian. The Yiyang Finger specializes in projecting <i>qi </i>from a finger to attack an opponent at a distance with a destructive effect. It can also be used by a skilled acupuncturist to hit pressure points invisibly from far away.<br>
<br>
X. You meditate on Wuxiang Qiankun, attempting to advance your knowledge of the technique to a higher level now that you have had more practical experience with it in a real fight.<br>
<br>
XI. You meditate on Wuxiang Qiankun with Xuezi&#x2019;s help, allowing her insights to guide your development of the technique in a different direction than you would have on your own.

            <h3>五十 · Roadside Swordfight</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Roadside Swordfight</span></b><br>
<br>
The journey to Yangzhou proves relatively uneventful. You take the time to practice with Guo Fu and Master Zhang, broadening your martial arts base. The art of Taiji fits in well with your ability to separate your chaotic <i>qi</i>, and soon you have absorbed all that Guo Fu can impart to you. The rest would have to come from your own experiences and understanding. The others had not been idle, either. Xuezi had decided to throw out a few tidbits of information from her repository of knowledge; she&#x2019;s been in a good mood for a while now. Qilin, Cao&#x2019;er and Yunzi each learned a close combat technique from her. Yifang studied the Yuhe Finger with her sister, while Lingshu adapted the Minamoto sword technique with your help. It would still be more efficient with an actual wodao, but it was sufficient for her needs as a secondary sword style to complement her own techniques. Armaiti had borrowed one of Xuxian&#x2019;s notes from you, practicing the Yiyang Finger.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
On the way, you had expected Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai to attack again, but surprisingly enough, they do not appear. Perhaps they are waiting for the Ten Swords Conference. You take the chance to ask Shun and Gao Ying about them, and if they had heard anything from Chief Jiang regarding the child hostages.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He is still working on it,&#x201D; says Gao Ying. &#x201C;Though the constables have managed to identify the location of the children, retrieving them is a different matter. They are being kept in the Zhang mansion itself, in Chang&#x2019;an. It will not be an easy task.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The constables <i>do </i>have the clout to storm the place and generally make a mess of things. I arranged it so that they would have that power from a legal perspective,&#x201D; quips Shun, &#x201C;but I think if hostages are at stake, we must tread more carefully. I am on the verge of getting their patron Grand Eunuch under my thumb, as with all the others. Don&#x2019;t worry, Jing. We will succeed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You raise an eyebrow. &#x201C;Should you be out here gallivanting in the countryside, then, Your Majesty?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have to pay attention to my personal power once in a while, you know. Li Shimin, Emperor Taizong, was an exemplary general and warrior himself. The nobles respect power at the end of a sword. Given that the influence of martial arts has only expanded over the years, it behooves me to take an interest in any important <i>jianghu </i>events&#x2026; particularly ones that might ill influence the state of the nation.&#x201D; He chuckles. &#x201C;Really, it&#x2019;s a wonder I don&#x2019;t worry more about one of these people who can single-handedly destroy entire companies of soldiers suddenly deciding to overthrow me and put my head on the palace walls.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is why we make alliances and create contingency plans, Your Majesty.&#x201D; Gao Ying bows his head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Besides, anyone coming after you would have to go through me first, Shun,&#x201D; you say brightly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The sentiment is appreciated, but you can&#x2019;t be by my side all the time now, can you? What with the Fire Temple and all,&#x201D; Shun smiles at you slyly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, there&#x2019;s that&#x2026; wait, when did you find out?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was pretty obvious to me. No matter. If we play our cards right, I can declare a general amnesty for the Fire Temple. They too can be of use. Just stay sharp for any opportunities to serve the country and I&#x2019;ll have my excuse,&#x201D; he grins.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
It was not long after that, that you received a pigeon from the Fire Temple in response to your letter. You decided to open it together with Yunzi and Armaiti.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s smudged,&#x201D; mutters Armaiti. &#x201C;It looks like someone spilled wine all over it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, parts of it are still readable, at least,&#x201D; says Yunzi. &#x201C;Now, let&#x2019;s see&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
From what you could make out of the letter, the Amesha Spenta back at the temple are quite pleased that you had found the Holy Maiden and established ties with Shaolin. &#x2018;When the time is right, strike while their back is turned, Lord Xu,&#x2019; suggests Manah. There is also a bit about Kunlun&#x2019;s fire medicine that you cannot fully understand thanks to the smudges, but it seems that they have made some headway there. Finally, at the very end of the letter, there is a strongly worded reminder from Haurvatat that the Holy Maiden <i>must</i> remain chaste until the night of the wedding, and Ameretat has added a scribble saying that should the Fire Lord feel any uncontrollable urges, he should feel free to break in the Amesha of Earth instead.<br>
<br>
Yunzi rips up the letter and lights it on fire, and Armaiti helps her bury the ashes in the ground.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
A few hours away from the city, Guo Fu and his family depart your company temporarily: they are to meet up with his Wudang brethren at Shijie Village before entering Yangzhou. Seeing him off, the rest of you press on. It does not take long, however, before you have an encounter that feels rather random to you. Hearing the sounds of fighting coming from ahead of you, you gesture at Shun to stay where he is while you head cautiously towards the battle.<br>
<br>
It is Taishan. You recognize the leader of Taishan, Su Cheng; he is engaged in battle along with one of his disciples against a swordsman wearing a painted opera mask. Behind them, the Taishan Seven are watching the fight nervously. What draws your attention most, however, is the slim, blood-red sword of the masked man.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That would be the Chixiao Sword,&#x201D; says Master Zhang as he echoes your thoughts. &#x201C;And that Taishan disciple is wielding the Tai&#x2019;e Sword,&#x201D; he continues, pointing out the bronze-coloured blade forged in a classical style.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would have thought that the master would have been wielding it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps he has his reasons&#x2026; but that does not matter.&#x201D; Master Zhang&#x2019;s lips widen in a smile as he watches the fierce swordfight. &#x201C;Which one of us should take this round?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you <i>that </i>interested, master?&#x201D; Looking more closely at the masked man, you ask, &#x201C;Could that sheathed sword be another of the Great Swords?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It seems likely, but we will not know which it is until it is drawn. Well, standing here just talking is beginning to bore me. What will you do, my disciple?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you <i>really </i>willing to let me take this fight?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can wait for the main dish. I am a patient man.&#x201D; He is probably talking about the Sword Saint, who is likely the only person among the Ten Swords that can pique Master Zhang&#x2019;s interest. &#x201C;Still,&#x201D; he continues, &#x201C;if you want to take this fight, I have one condition.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Another one of your lessons, master?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Use only your Yuchang Sword in the battle, and only the sword techniques you have learnt. That is all.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It looks like he wants you to test your sword skills in a real fight. &#x201C;What if I get pressured and accidentally use another move?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There will be punishment,&#x201D; he states simply. &#x201C;But I do not expect that to happen with your current level of ability.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He may be taking things a bit too lightly: down there is a master of one of the Eight Sects, a disciple who he has deemed worthy of wielding the sect&#x2019;s treasure, as well as a swordsman who could fend them both off. Besides that, the Taishan Seven are also waiting in the wings. It is not a very safe situation. In fact, the rest of your companions seem content to wait it out, except for Yifang and Lingshu, who seem to want to help the Taishan pugilists as an orthodox knee-jerk reflex, and Yunzi, who is tapping her foot impatiently.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You back out and let Master Zhang handle it. You&#x2019;d like to see him cut loose once in a while, and it&#x2019;s likely to end up with him claiming whatever Great Swords they have from their mutilated corpses. Of course, your reputation with your companions is not likely to be improved by this action, but you think it is worth it.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You enter the fight on the side of the Taishan pugilists. Perhaps this could be a chance for you to repair your relationship with them.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You enter the fight on the side of the masked man. You have no love for the orthodox sects, and it <i>is </i>two-on-one at the moment.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You enter the fight to mess with the both of them. If you are going to fight, you might as well really challenge yourself at the same time.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You call on Yifang and Lingshu to side with the Taishan pugilists, while you and Yunzi will join and try to side with the masked man just for the kick of it.<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You use Wuxiang Qiankun.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You don&#x2019;t use Wuxiang Qiankun.

            <h3>五十一 · Interference</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Interference</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good morning!&#x201D; Picking a suitable moment, you leap in with a short greeting, landing right in the middle of the fight. Your Yuchang Sword slides out of its sheath smoothly, adding a third sword to the two currently in a deadlock. &#x201C;What are you guys doing? This looks fun. Can I join in?&#x201D; The Taishan disciple and the masked swordsman turn their eyes to you, evidently confused.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D; asks the young Taishan swordsman.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is the Yuchang Sword, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; says the masked man, his interest coming through in his voice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You! Man Tiger Pig!&#x201D; shouts out Su Cheng in realization. He backs away immediately, his own, more mundane sword waving in your face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes! It is I, Man Tiger Pig!&#x201D; you declare dramatically in return. It would only be fair to match his enthusiasm. Exerting your strength, you push your sword down and break the deadlock, forcing the two swords apart.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Liu Qi! Get him!&#x201D; commands Su Cheng.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, Master!&#x201D; As the Taishan swordsman raises his sword, and the masked person his, you feel a tremendous pressure bearing down on you from both sides: this is the power of their respective Great Swords. The Tai&#x2019;e Sword instils fear in the enemy, while the Chixiao Sword emits a commanding aura.<br>
<br>
A single bead of sweat rolls down your brow as they strike at you simultaneously. Raising your blade, you step back smartly and block their swords with a single move. Behind you, Su Cheng makes his move, hoping to catch you unawares. Jumping to avoid his attack, you flip over the two opponents in front of you, twisting your sword free of theirs.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a hundred years too early to defeat me in a mental battle if this is all you can muster,&#x201D; you laugh, taunting Liu Qi and the masked man. Fighters like Yang Xue, Ahura, Master Zhang or Vairya exuded much more pressure in a fight: it is something you have become used to.<br>
<br>
You dart forward the moment you land, swinging your sword rapidly as you execute the Gentle Storm Dance. For a while, they are placed on the defensive by your fierce attack, but the three of them rally &#x2013; the masked man deciding to temporarily cooperate with the Taishan master and disciple team to defeat this interloper. When they retaliate, it is with a barrage of slashes and stabs that you can barely catch. Interspersed between the strong slashes of the Tai&#x2019;e Sword are quick, red flashes from the Chixiao Sword, deadly attacks that could end your life if you make even a single misstep. And behind it all, Su Cheng launches precise, pinpoint attacks to support his disciple, defending him from any counterattack you could make. There is no flaw in their cooperation: the masked man must have been skilled indeed to match them thus far.<br>
<br>
Unsurprisingly, you are pushed back by their assault. Taking the opportunity given without hesitation, Su Cheng and his disciple flank you, moving around to your sides. &#x201C;Ha, I have you where I want you now, Xu Jing!&#x201D; gloats Su Cheng.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Funny. I would say the same,&#x201D; you grin as he closes in. Being surrounded is just what you wanted.  You take your stance, standing upright and shifting your left foot behind your right as you hold out the Yuchang Sword at arm&#x2019;s length, pointed at the ground in front of you. It is a simple, basic stance. In your mind you imagine a circle, its radius comprised of your reach and the blade&#x2019;s length. The lines that each attack and counter-attack could travel along begin to take shape within that circle, simple but ever-changing; it is a mental guide of sorts, for novices to the technique. According to Guo Fu, real masters have no need to imagine any such thing, as the Way is their very being. Since you aren&#x2019;t one, you make do with it. You swing your sword behind your head, intercepting Su Cheng&#x2019;s blade. Gently twisting, you bring your arm back over your head as you lean backward, guiding his sword along the lines of your imagination. Your movements are precise, using the least amount of force to guide Su Cheng on his way. His eyes widen in surprise as he stumbles forward, right into the arms of his unsuspecting disciple. He crashes into Liu Qi, sending the both of them tumbling to the ground.<br>
<br>
Your attack is not over yet, however &#x2013; sweeping forward in a graceful arc, your sword finds the masked man mid-slash. The Yuchang Blade glides under the Chixiao Sword, going along with it as you transfer his forward momentum into a circular motion strong enough to wrench the sword from his fingers. At least, it would be, if he had not gripped it so tightly that he spun along with it, flying away from you. You return to your stance, redrawing the circle in your mind and finding that your attackers have been removed from within it, as you desired.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;T-t-t-t-h-aaaa&#x2026; thaaa..&#x201D; stutters Su Cheng, staring at you wide-eyed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Taiji?&#x201D; mutters his disciple, frowning. &#x201C;Why would Man Tiger Pig&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;L-Let&#x2019;s retreat for now, Qi,&#x201D; says Su Cheng, getting to his feet quickly. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s too risky to fight here. Emei&#x2019;s sword <i>and</i> Wudang&#x2019;s technique in the hands of Zhang Jue&#x2019;s disciple&#x2026; something is strange about this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, Master,&#x201D; replies Liu Qi glumly.<br>
<br>
You are about to call after the two as they run off with the Taishan Seven, but a sudden spike of killing intent changes your mind. Spinning around, you brace the flat of the Yuchang Sword against your arm as you block a powerful strike that leaves the blade ringing. Your other opponent is back on his feet, guffawing behind his painted mask. The other sword is drawn now &#x2013; a gleaming white blade dotted with seven gems. If it is a Great Sword, it can only be the Qixing Longyuan Sword formerly of Wudang. &#x201C;Not bad, not bad at all. Wielder of the Yuchang Sword. You caught me by surprise before, but things will be different now. Taiji, eh?&#x201D; You get the distinct feeling that he thinks he can defeat your moves. &#x201C;Well, from how the Tai&#x2019;e Sword holders responded, you seem to be Xu Jing, otherwise known as the Man Tiger Pig,&#x201D; he continues. &#x201C;That is good. I will be coming for you, now that I know you have the Yuchang Sword. Be prepared.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to be so ominous about it. You do mean you are coming for me right now, correct? Right now is a good time.&#x201D; You waggle your sword at him. He still has some moves up his sleeves, clearly, but so do you.<br>
<br>
He shakes his head. &#x201C;No. I can sense your master watching us from somewhere. I do not want to deal with him just yet. Farewell, Man Tiger Pig! I will be coming for you! Ahahahahahahahaha!&#x201D; Laughing maniacally, he sheathes his crimson sword.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You already said that, without the crazy laughter,&#x201D; you call out as you lunge at him, but with surprising agility he leaps off of your sword and bounces off with his <i>qinggong</i>, rapidly disappearing into the distance, laughing all the way.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Great, another nutcase,&#x201D; you mutter, shaking your head. The fight hadn&#x2019;t lasted as half long as you expected: they seemed all too quick to retreat when they realized you weren&#x2019;t easy prey. Especially that masked man; you can understand if the orthodox Taishan didn&#x2019;t want to get embroiled in a fight, but him? You think about it for a second, and then frown at Master Zhang, who has appeared besides you and is looking decidedly amused.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So what was <i>that </i>all about, Master?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A gesture that will bear glorious fruit in the coming days, my disciple,&#x201D; grins Zhang Jue.<br>
<br>
You sigh. It certainly means that you are getting into trouble.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You enter Yangzhou with no further trouble. Though you had planned to make Yuhua Hall your first stop and base of operations while in the city, the collective will of the girls pulled you away and to a more respectable establishment. The Madame of Yuhua Hall and her adjutant were not present; according to the doormen, they would be back in the next couple of days. You would have to settle your royalty affairs with them then. Xiahou Yu and Liu Chanfeng were not around either &#x2013; as it turns out, they had actually departed with the Madame for a brief trip to a lake down south.<br>
<br>
The beggars here seem to be friendlier than the ones up north; after conversing with them for a while and proving your identity, they confide in you that most of the beggars here support Qi Liuwu and Jiu Mou. According to them, the two would arrive in the city any day now, but it was not certain when exactly. From them, you also find out more about the masked swordsman as well as the Chengying Sword, which once belonged to Xiahou Yu&#x2019;s family.<br>
<br>
The masked man&#x2019;s name is Jian Yixiao, dubbed the Sword Demon. He has engaged plenty of swordsmen in duels, leaving behind a trail of bodies in his wake. It looks like his aim is to eventually challenge the Sword Saint and replace him at the peak of the world of swords. To that end, he is on a hunt for every Great Sword he can get his hands on. The stories say that he was not behind the theft of the Qixing Longyuan from Wudang, but he was certainly responsible for killing the man who eventually ended up with it afterwards. From the looks of it, the Sword Demon is likely to challenge you again, before the Ten Swords Conference; he&#x2019;s aiming to gather as much of the swords as possible before then.<br>
<br>
You also find out that the holder of the Chengying Sword is said to be staying at the Zhou Clan Manor while awaiting the conference. Though the beggar is unable to give you any more details than that, he suggests that the Sword Demon might be going after that sword too.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the wielder of the Chunjun Sword has arrived in town, meeting up with the possessors of the Tai&#x2019;e Sword: Huashan and Taishan are now staying together in the city. Nie Wuxing has come with an entourage consisting of his wife, Bai Jiutian, and the Huashan Twin Flowers. Liu Ye of Kunlun, with his disciple Su Liaojing, are also here in a show of solidarity.<br>
<br>
Of course, so is Wudang, and according to Yifang, she did spot her ex-colleagues of the Castration Nun squad walking about.<br>
<br>
Of the Sword Saint, there is no news, even from the beggars, whether he would even show up. The man appears to be a rather reclusive enigma of the highest order.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You have a couple of days before you visit Yuhua Hall. You should spend it looking into the various people that will be involved in the Ten Swords Conference.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You investigate the Sword Demon&#x2019;s whereabouts further. If he is coming for you, as he has declared, you would like to know so that you can go for him first and turn the tables. You don&#x2019;t want to sit around and wait for a challenge &#x2013; or worse, an ambush from him.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You visit the Zhou Clan Manor. You might not be welcome walking in through the front doors, so you will just have to sneak in at night, get in contact with Miss Zhou, and find out more about the current wielder of the Chengying Sword. You might also be able to prevent the Sword Demon from causing more trouble here.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You pay a courteous visit to Nie Wuxing and the orthodox alliance. They would not dare do anything right in the middle of crowded Yangzhou, in broad daylight. You think it would be interesting and amusing to tr&#x2026; talk to them for a bit, while you can.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Yifang has suggested that she and Lingshu approach the Castration Nuns to talk about the Yuchang Sword. You wonder if it is wise to do so; on one hand, they could be your allies, but on the other, if they are still miffed about what you did&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You allow Yifang to contact the nuns.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&#x2019;t allow Yifang to contact the nuns.

            <h3>五十二 · Moonlit Manor</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Moonlit Manor</span></b><br>
<br>
The Zhou Manor was just as you remembered it. Getting past the small army of guards was simple enough; finding Zhou Zixia&#x2019;s room a bit more difficult. Moving unseen from pillar to pillar, you peek in through the cracks of the windows. The first room you come across is that of Zhou Zhideng fast asleep in the embrace of his young wife, his child dozing in a cot off to the side. Moving on, you spy on a few more rooms before you finally find the person you want. You enter the room without a sound, quietly moving towards the bed. Stretching out a finger, you poke the sleeping maiden&#x2019;s cheek. It takes you a few pokes before her eyes slowly open and she looks up groggily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D; She is still muddled from her sleep, it seems.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Long time no see,&#x201D; you say quietly, and Zhou Zixia sits up with a start.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You-&#x201C; She begins her exclamation loudly before catching herself and lowering her voice. &#x201C;You&#x2026; <i>what are you doing here</i>?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was in town, and just thought I would drop by for a chat.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;At this hour of the night?&#x201D; Miss Zhou backs up against the wall, drawing her blankets around herself tightly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m not here for that.&#x201D; You chuckle, and add cheekily, &#x201C;Not tonight, anyway.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It is a pity you cannot enjoy the look on her face thanks to the darkness. Attempting to regain her composure, she shakes her head at you. &#x201C;Visiting at such times in my room is highly improper. I understand that you are one to do your own thing, Xu Jing, but this is very rude.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t exactly walk through the gates in broad daylight now, can I? Your father would not be happy to see me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026; yes,&#x201D; she admits, reminded of the battle on the island and the favour she owes you. &#x201C;I suppose so.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Anyway, you <i>are </i>right. I shouldn&#x2019;t have come unannounced, and for that I apologize,&#x201D; you say lightly. &#x201C;Still, since I&#x2019;m <i>already </i>here, let&#x2019;s make things quick. I need some help from you. Do you know of the Chengying Sword?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s&#x2026; one of the Great Swords, isn&#x2019;t it? But why are you asking about it?&#x201D; She is puzzled, but slightly hesitant at the same time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is the wielder of that sword staying here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Instantly, she becomes defensive. &#x201C;Why do you want to know that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m not here to kill or rob, or anything of the sort.&#x201D; Probably. You are not ruling out those courses of action yet, depending on what you find. &#x201C;I just want to have a little talk. It&#x2019;s not too big a favour to ask, is it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After thinking about it for a while, she nods. &#x201C;Very well. I will tell you what you need to know. In return, promise that you will not hurt her.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Her?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. The owner of the sword is my friend, Minyue. We are childhood friends who studied in the same place for years, so I can vouch for her character.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did she tell you how she came by the sword, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Her brother gave it to her, and asked her to be his representative at this sword conference.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She must be a very good swordswoman,&#x201D; you say. There is more you want to ask regarding the suspicious circumstances about how this Minyue girl came by the sword, but you think it would be easier to ask her directly. Besides, something is starting to feel wrong and it is not your conversation with Zhou Zixia. There is a strange mood in the air tonight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She is&#x2026; good, I suppose. Better than me, certainly. But I&#x2019;ve heard that she <i>did</i> return from an apprenticeship to the Sword Saint recently, so her skills must have improved by leaps and bounds.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You hold up your hand. &#x201C;Wait, I thought the Sword Saint&#x2019;s disciple was male.&#x201D; Murong Yandi had been a man no matter how you looked at him. You are sure about that.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Was it? Well, maybe he had two,&#x201D; shrugs Miss Zhou. You certainly hope that is the case. Your heart can&#x2019;t take it if there was yet another Bai Jiutian walking about.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, your hackles raise as a wave of intense killing intent sweeps over the entire manor. Your nostrils flare, catching the scent of blood. &#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; asks Zixia, confused as she too notices that something is off. A gong is rung repeatedly, and a commotion soon follows; from the screams, it sounds as if people are fighting &#x2013; and dying &#x2013; just outside.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stay here,&#x201D; you whisper, edging towards the window. As you peek out towards the courtyard, you hear a loud scream. Blood splashes against the window, soaking the paper a dark, deep red. Zixia lets out a brief shriek, clutching the blankets against her. You fling the window open in a hurry. The owner of the blood &#x2013; a Zhou guard &#x2013;  is slumped against the wall outside the room. At least, half of him is. The other half is still lying in the center of the courtyard.<br>
<br>
There, the Laughing Sword Demon stands. Surrounded by bodies, a fine mist of red still hanging in the air under the bright full moon, he howls at the night sky in shrill laughter. The two Great Swords, Chixiao and Qixing Longyuan, are stabbed into the ground in front of him as if in offering to the dead. The crimson blade seems to be an even more vibrant shade of red tonight, while the pristine white sword remains untouched by even a single droplet of blood.<br>
<br>
Facing him are Zhou Dingqiu, his son, and the remnants of the guards, who number barely a dozen now.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Jian Yixiao,&#x201D; growls Zhou Dingqiu. &#x201C;Just what is the meaning of this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They were in my way, Master Zhou. Where is the wielder of the Chengying Sword? That is the only person I seek here. If they would come out now, I will spare the rest of your miserable lives.&#x201D; Behind that mask comes a voice full of mirth. There is something different about the Sword Demon tonight, compared to when you had met him on the road. He seems sharper somehow&#x2026; more real. More deadly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;H-here. I am here!&#x201D; A pretty young woman that you have never seen before strides forth, although her step falters the moment she leaves the relative safety of the Zhou contingent. &#x201C;I am Zhang Minyue, wielder of the Chengying Sword. What business do you have with me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm, a lass? No matter. I want that sword. Hand it over,&#x201D; says the masked man bluntly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It would shame my clan if I did that. No, I think not,&#x201D; she shakes her head fiercely.<br>
<br>
It looks like the matter will not be resolved peacefully. Zhou Zixia tugs at your sleeve, having ventured off the bed, although the blankets are still wrapped around her to avoid revealing her sleeping attire. &#x201C;Can you help them? Please?&#x201D; she pleads. She seems to be on the verge of running out there if you do not agree. You think it is likely that the Sword Demon might wipe out the rest of the Zhou Manor if they try to interfere in the fight; nothing in Zhang Minyue&#x2019;s bearing gives you the confidence that she might defeat him&#x2026; although the Sword Saint too was unassuming at first glance.<br>
<br>
You are not certain. Your instincts tell you that Jian Yixiao is dangerous, warning you to flee immediately. You have no guarantee of defeating this man.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You flee from Zhou Manor. What happens to the Zhou family or Zhang Minyue is not your concern. More importantly, you need to survive. It is pointless to die here.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You decide to join in the fight, working together with Zhang Minyue and the Zhou clan. Perhaps you can chase him off again, like you did before. You are not certain whether they will welcome your help at this moment, or that it will even be enough, but the only thing you can do is to try.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You run in and attempt to steal the Chengying Sword right in front of everyone. If you succeed, that means the Sword Demon&#x2019;s attention will be focused on you. However, whether you succeed or fail, you are guaranteed to draw hostility from Zhang Minyue and the Zhous, perhaps forcing you into a fight on two fronts.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You wait and watch. It would be more prudent to see what the Sword Demon and Zhang Minyue can do first. Hopefully there will not be too much bloodshed before they are weakened enough so that you can defeat them both at once.

            <h3>五十三 · The Demonic Swordsman</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Demonic Swordsman</span></b><br>
<br>
Jian Yixiao begins humming an odd, joyful tune, his hands raised towards the moon. As Zhang Minyue approaches him with trepidation, hand shivering over sword hilt, you turn to Zhou Zixia and say, &#x201C;<i>Stay here</i>, and don&#x2019;t do anything stupid,&#x201D; giving her a quick rap on the head. She yelps in surprise at your uncouth behaviour. Taking a deep breath, you crouch down, readying yourself as you draw the Yuchang Sword. The seconds pass by in a painfully slow manner. Zhang Minyue reaches the Sword Demon, standing before him in preparation for their showdown. The two Great Swords are still stabbed into the ground between them, swaying gently as the wind picks up. The Zhou family are watching with bated breath, ready to interfere on their guest&#x2019;s behalf if necessary. Zhang Minyue shrinks back involuntarily as her opponent&#x2019;s humming ceases and his arms lower. His full attention is on her now.<br>
<br>
Just the moment you&#x2019;ve been waiting for.<br>
<br>
You spring into motion, crashing through the window and launching yourself into the courtyard. Your powerful lunge carries you all the way to the Sword Demon, approaching from his side. He turns, but a fraction too late. Too slow. The Yuchang Sword glints dangerously, homing in on your target: a sweet spot right between his ribs. You are not going to play around with this man &#x2013; you realize just how dangerous he is.<br>
<br>
Jian Yixiao will not be able to block this blow, unarmed as he is.<br>
<br>
Behind the mask, his eyes widen with surprise for just a brief, almost imperceptible moment.<br>
<br>
His foot moves rapidly, stomping the ground once.<br>
<br>
Right before your blade touches his body, a shining blur flies up, knocking it off course. Instead of piercing his heart, it cuts across his shoulder, merely drawing blood. You spin around in the air as your strike carries you past the Sword Demon, landing in a crouch. You feel a small sting on your cheek. Without even looking, you know that you have been cut. Jian Yixiao is standing there, in that annoying mask, his hands held to the sides and palms outward. His swords are still in the ground, but many others thud into the ground around you as they fall back to earth; the blades of the dead guards. His stomp had sent them flying into the air.<br>
<br>
The Sword Demon lets out a low chuckle, snatching a sword from mid-air as he leaps at you. &#x201C;A surprising appearance!&#x201D; he exclaims cheerfully, swinging away. &#x201C;You may yet be a man after my own heart!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Defending against his expert slashes with equal precision, you turn his sword away and go on the attack. &#x201C;If you will stand still for <i>just </i>a second, I&#x2019;ll show you just how right you are,&#x201D; you grin, suddenly withdrawing your sword in a feint as you execute the first part of the Deceptive Fish Stab. Carried along, the Sword Demon over-extends himself.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A stab, eh?&#x201D; he predicts unconcernedly. Even as he says that, he twists his wrist, preparing to counter your move, but it is not exactly the stab that he called. You lash out with your palm, catching him by surprise with the Graceful Dragon Uncoils. The force of your strike easily blows his sword out of his hand. As you prepare to follow up with a slice aimed at his neck, he kicks out, dropping down low and sweeping the ground. Two more swords fly up into the air and at you. As you hurriedly bat them away with your blade, he catches them, whirling around in a flashing, deadly dervish. You attempt to go into the Taiji stance at the last second, but the unexpected strength and speed of his attack knocks your guard wide, leaving you open before the circle is drawn and you can muster up a counter.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ahahahahahahahaha!&#x201D; laughs the masked swordsman as he prepares to run you through with both swords.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;S-s-style twenty four, the darkening shadow of the waning moon!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Jian Yixiao spins around and shouts, aborting his attack and hurling himself upwards as a powerful crescent of sword <i>qi </i>cuts through the ground where he had just been. Somersaulting across the grounds, he returns to his original position at the start of the fight. Zhang Minyue has drawn the Chengying Sword. Held high up in the night sky, its thin blade is ethereal, its edges almost invisible except for where the moonlight strikes it <i>just </i>right.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Two swords in one night. I am a lucky, lucky man indeed,&#x201D; laughs the Sword Demon. &#x201C;Come! Let this be a night of revelry in blood and blades!&#x201D; He raises his arms upwards, his <i>qi </i>rushing forth. The Chixiao and Qixing Longyuan swords fly into his hands as every other sword in the courtyard begins vibrating, ringing in tune with one another.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Style twenty four!&#x201D; shouts Zhang Minyue again as she sends another wave towards Jian Yixiao. The Chixiao Sword flashes red as he brings it down, slicing through her <i>qi </i>with little effort. Cackling, he goes after her, slashing away wildly. The girl retreats frantically, unable to hold in the face of his powerful assault. Though now you would feel much safer being on the defensive, you have no choice but to leap into the fight: you cannot miss this opportunity. Mixing up your sword moves and unarmed styles and using everything you have at your disposal, you go toe to toe with the Sword Demon as Zhang Minyue tries to work together with you without asking any unnecessary questions. Jian Yixiao&#x2019;s fighting style has become even stranger &#x2013; even as you try to corner him with your swift sword dance, he is able to put himself into positions where your attacks disarm him rather than cause any lethal hits. At the same time, he would seemingly summon another sword from the ground, continuing his relentless fight without a single pause. At one time, you swear that he is juggling at least a dozen swords in the air, blocking and retaliating while humming his little tune. Even when you drop into the Taiji Sword stance, the constant rise and fall of the myriad swords is too much for you to track reliably at your level of understanding... your opponent is truly a master swordsman.<br>
<br>
You grin, excitement starting to overtake you.<br>
<br>
As Jian Yixiao&#x2019;s hand reaches for yet another sword, you stretch out and grab it before he does. Drawing your arm back, you hurl the sword at him. He is forced to draw the Qixing Longyuan Sword to block your attack, before trying to get another sword. You repeat his moves, competing with him for the swords as the both of you begin laughing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Style twenty four!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Spinning, he breaks away from your little competition to avoid Zhang Minyue&#x2019;s attack. Her distraction has given you the opening you need. Jumping into the air, you unleash a blinding flurry of kicks that send all of the swords flying towards Jian Yixiao. Red and white streaks blaze through the air as he parries them inerringly with his two Great Swords. While he is busy with that, however, you land behind him. Tightening the knot by pulling at it with your teeth, you complete the trap you have set from the start of the fight.<br>
<br>
The crimson strings spring up from where they have been hiding in the grass, wrapping themselves around every sword that he has been using. The Sword Demon leaps up before his feet are entangled by the spider silk, and lands gently atop the courtyard-spanning web that you have set up, balancing on the tip of one foot. &#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; he murmurs amusedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t give me an &#x2018;oh&#x2019; yet, it&#x2019;s not over!&#x201D; you shout triumphantly, twisting your fingers around the silk in your hand and yanking hard. The web closes, flying up around Jian Yixiao with the countless swords you have ensnared in it pointing inwards at him. There is no escape. The swords sheathe themselves in his flesh, piercing his body from all angles before he can raise a finger in defense. He coughs, red trickling out from under his mask. The grass is wet with his blood, mingling with that of his victims. He is no longer humming or laughing. Instead, the only sound that you can hear, amidst the stunned silence at the fight&#x2019;s sudden and brutal end, is the sound of dripping blood.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;D-did we do it?&#x201D; asks Zhang Minyue nervously. &#x201C;Is he dead?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, let&#x2019;s ask him, shall we? Hey!&#x201D; you call out loudly, &#x201C;Are you dead yet?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There is no response. The surviving Zhou guards begin closing in tentatively, now that the threat is over.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That answers it,&#x201D; you shrug, turning to her. &#x201C;So now, about the-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
You pause. There is a low, quiet laughter. You turn around. The Sword Demon&#x2019;s body is shuddering, as if holding back a flood of mirth. He throws his bloody masked head backwards, his maniacal laughter reaching a crescendo that echoes all throughout Zhou Manor.  Zhou Dingqiu and his guards shout out in horror, scrambling over themselves in an attempt to get as far away from this nightmare as they can. You watch, transfixed, as the swords appear to sink even deeper into his body, until even the hilts cannot be seen.  &#x201C;What a night&#x2026; what a night it has been!&#x201D; exclaims Jian Yixiao. His right arm blurs, the Chixiao Sword glowing blood-red as it moves at speeds almost too fast for you to follow. The silk around him falls away, cut into innumerable little pieces in an instant. &#x201C;But is that all you have? Surely there is more?&#x201D; He begins walking towards you slowly, swords in hand.  Zhang Minyue ducks behind you, her eyes wide with fear.<br>
<br>
This is&#x2026; strange. You grit your teeth, wondering what to do next. Could he actually be a<i> real demon</i>? You don&#x2019;t have a ready explanation for what you have just seen at the moment; it could be some form of esoteric technique, but it could also readily be a supernatural phenomenon, and you are not too well equipped to handle the latter.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do have more, but the night is growing late and all good kids need to go to bed! Perhaps we can leave this for another time, Master Demon?&#x201D; you shout.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am an impatient, impatient man at times,&#x201D; he laughs in return, &#x201C;and you are only saying that because you think you do not have the advantage at the moment.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-I should have stayed with Master Nie,&#x201D; whimpers Zhang Minyue behind you. &#x201C;Why did I come here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nudge her sharply, hissing &#x201C;Shape up!&#x201D; This is no time to be mired in woe&#x2026; not with such a threat standing in front of you. Staring at the approaching Sword Demon, you begin to think.<br>
<br>
Perhaps he is walking slowly not out of any sense of drama, but because he is too wounded to move his feet swiftly.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you are wrong.<br>
<br>
But if you are correct, you might still have a chance to turn this around.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You quickly devise a plan together with Zhang Minyue to catch the Sword Demon offguard. If he is truly a demon&#x2026; well, you remember how you once dealt with one. You just need to get that mask off, do the deed, and you should be able to claim victory. Hopefully. Even if it doesn&#x2019;t work, it should be surprising enough that you can make a comeback.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You can still use Wuxiang Qiankun on him. Though you can sense a strong, dark undercurrent of <i>qi </i>running through his body, it is not impossible to mimic him. You may be able to dispatch the Sword Demon one on one at the moment should you use your trump card. After all, your claws are just as lethal as your sword, if it comes down to it.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You exhort the Zhou family to join the fight. The Sword Demon may actually be weakened now, and with everyone piling in, it should be too much for even him to handle. The fight is not over yet. It would also put more bodies between you and him, making it a safer plan compared to your other options.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>It&apos;s time to do the smart thing. You yell at everyone to scatter and run. There&apos;s no point standing around here waiting to fight someone who is still alive after being run through with so many blades - you&apos;ll save whoever you can and then flee the premises as fast as you are able to.

            <h3>五十四 · The Morning After</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Morning After</span></b><br>
<br>
Your head hurts. Pounding from the inside, as if something is trying to escape your skull. You open your eyes. The light blinds you, causing you to squint, to hold up your hand to blot it out. It is already day. Coughing, you pull yourself up, your back sliding painfully against the rough wall. Every bone in your body is aching. It had been a rough night&#x2026; night?<br>
<br>
You clutch your head, trying to recall the events of the night before. You remember little.<br>
<br>
The Sword Demon had approached, and you had met him in battle. You recall mirroring his techniques, his ability, his strength. Turning his own weapons upon him. You had been drawn into the frenetic fight, revelling in the excitement and the bloodshed. Losing yourself in battle, giving all you had over to it. That was the only way to win. To crush your opponent in a direct confrontation. Wasn&#x2019;t that your style?<br>
<br>
When Jian Yixiao lay lifeless in the center of the ruined courtyard, atop the pebbles and the grass, you stood over him and removed his mask.<br>
<br>
Just a man, after all.<br>
<br>
The agonizing pulse throbbing in your head intensifies. Letting out a groan, you sink back to the cobbled ground, attempting to beat back the pain. After you had defeated the Sword Demon, you had decided to leave immediately for some reason, and everything after that is a hazy mess. The one thing that you do remember, however, is that you took his swords. The Chixiao and Qixing Longyuan swords. No one had attempted to stop you. As for how you ended up in this dirty alleyway, you have no idea.<br>
<br>
The sun grows stronger, rising further above your head. You let out a huge sigh as the headache subsides. Getting to your feet, you wrap the swords tightly in your grasp and stumble off, your footing still unsure. You have to make your way back to the inn. The others must be worried. Last night was truly a close shave; if you had been any less quick, any less skilled, the corpse left behind in Zhou Manor would have been you instead.<br>
<br>
A fragment of a question floats into your mind.<br>
<br>
It was&#x2026; yes, something that Jian Yixiao had asked, when you were battling him across the rooftop. In between the fierce slashes and powerful blows, he had said something.<br>
<br>
Why do you fight?<br>
<br>
You do not remember if you answered that question out loud, or if you merely thought the answer. You do not even remember your answer. A stinging pain shoots up your spine and right into your brain, and you almost fall over. It is strange. Why are you thinking so hard about that question? It is an easy question. You have no doubts about the answer. You have always been certain, right? The answer has always been one thing and one thing only. There is only <i>one </i>sane answer you can give to such a question.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>For the Empire.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>For the Emperor.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>For the people.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>For the sake of fighting.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>For great justice.<br>
<br>
<b>F. </b>For power.<br>
<br>
<b>G. </b>For the swords.<br>
<br>
<b>H. </b>For those that depend on you.<br>
<br>
<b>I. </b>For those that you love.<br>
<br>
<b>J. </b>For the person you love.<br>
<br>
<b>K. </b>For everything.<br>
<br>
<b>L. </b>For nothing at all.

            <h3>五十五 · Tea Meeting</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tea Meeting</span></b><br>
<br>
The first thing you notice is the warmth of the sun on your face. Opening your one good eye, you notice that you are lying in the back of an alleyway. You groan &#x2013; your body hurts all over. You remember getting into a fight with the Sword Demon at the Zhou manor last night and little else. There had also been a strange dream of belligerent screaming men wearing little furred hats while riding on ponies, but you had no idea whatsoever what it all meant. Climbing to your feet, you steady yourself against a wall. You needed to return to the inn quickly; the girls must be worried.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er flies into your arms almost angrily. Faced with her reproachful, teary stare, you cannot help but apologize. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. It was a bit more troublesome than I expected.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a nice way of putting it,&#x201D; sighs Yunzi. &#x201C;We went to the Zhou manor to look for you but they said you had left immediately after the fight. What <i>did </i>you do to the place? It is in shambles.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t exactly remember&#x2026; but since I have <i>these</i>,&#x201D; you place the Chixiao Sword and Qixing Longyuan Sword that you had found lying next to you on the bed, &#x201C;I must have won, somehow.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That seems to be the case. When we got there, they were burning the Sword Demon&#x2019;s corpse,&#x201D; says Armaiti. You wonder if he was given a proper burial afterwards. You scratch your head, attempting to remember the details of the fight and failing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;alright, Jing?&#x201D; asks Cao&#x2019;er anxiously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;m alright,&#x201D; you smile. No point worrying them for now. With the Sword Conference on the horizon, and three of the Great Swords now in your possession, there might be more danger headed your way soon. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just exhausted from the night&#x2019;s activities. With a bit of rest, I should be back in perfect condition.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;strange,&#x201D; she mumbles, and turns away without a further word.<br>
<br>
You look around the room. Yifang and Lingshu are probably out meeting with the nuns, while Xuezi is in a corner, eyes closed in meditation. &#x201C;Where&#x2019;s Qilin?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She should be in the tea room downstairs,&#x201D; says Yunzi. &#x201C;You should probably let her know that you are back. She was worried sick all night.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So were you, Holy Maiden,&#x201D; adds Armaiti, who is instantly met with vehement denial.<br>
<br>
You would have liked to stay here and rest for a bit more, but Yunzi is right. Nodding, you head out of the room and towards the stairs. Still feeling slightly dizzy, you grip the railings firmly as you descend. You reach the doors of the tea room. You can hear Qilin&#x2019;s voice coming from within. Without thinking, you knock briefly and push the doors open. &#x201C;Qilin, I-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, you have returned,&#x201D; says Tulu Huodu calmly. &#x201C;Please, have a seat. Your timing is perfect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just the man I was waiting for!&#x201D; Chi Tianxie is in a cheery mood as usual, it seems.<br>
<br>
Master Zhang only gives you a firm, authoritative nod. He means that you should sit.<br>
<br>
Qilin gives you a look of utter defeat as you take a seat besides her. &#x201C;Well, at least you&#x2019;re alive,&#x201D; she mutters to herself.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D; you whisper.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have the worst timing, dear. Now we can&#x2019;t run.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, back to our discussion, Zhang,&#x201D; says Tulu Huodu. &#x201C;Now that your disciple is back, things have become a lot easier to talk about.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As I have said,&#x201D; replies Zhang Jue as he lowers his cup, &#x201C;his decisions are his own to make.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is, but you are his guardian. It is only right that we seek your permission first,&#x201D; says Chi Tianxie.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can ask him yourself.&#x201D; Master Zhang gives you a smirk that clearly signals his amusement.<br>
<br>
Clearing your throat, you address Qilin&#x2019;s father and uncle. &#x201C;Yes, what is it that you want to ask me?&#x201D; Of course, you already know. Qilin was right &#x2013; it&#x2019;s too late to run now. You should never have come down here.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;When are you going to marry my niece?&#x201D; Tulu Huodu comes at you bluntly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been quite a while now&#x2026; I know we aren&#x2019;t some respectable orthodox sect, and people may even think of us as immoral, but I don&#x2019;t want my daughter to waste away the bloom of her youth without a proper spouse. It&#x2019;s time to take responsibility, kid,&#x201D; points out Chi Tianxie.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father, it isn&#x2019;t-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
He raises his hand. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t be <i>too </i>patient with men, my dear daughter. I thought I taught you better than that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-you can&#x2019;t mean to tell me that the two of you came to Yangzhou just for this?&#x201D; you ask in disbelief.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not. There are <i>other </i>matters, ones that we will discuss later.&#x201D; Tulu Huodu shakes his bald head slowly, and then fixes you with his golden eyes. &#x201C;It was just a coincidence, but one that suited my purposes. Qilin is at a mature age&#x2026; She is already twenty. It is time for her to begin taking on responsibilities, even if it is a small part.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; agrees Chi Tianxie, stroking his bushy beard. &#x201C;So. What&#x2019;s it going to be? If you want to have the marriage now, I&#x2019;m all for it. We can always throw a big bash once the two of you are in Guizhou, but at least we can conduct the ceremony right now, just to make things official.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You cast a glance at your master. Perhaps&#x2026; no, he&#x2019;s grinning at your plight. No help will be forthcoming there.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You agree to take responsibility and marry Qilin immediately as your first legitimate wife, consolidating your link to the Wudu Cult. It is the right thing to do, and it is not like you dislike the idea. If you refuse to marry here, Tulu Huodu and Chi Tianxie would likely be displeased with you. Not to the extent of poisoning you, of course. Hopefully.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You attempt to delay the wedding. The Fire Temple will not be pleased if you actually put another woman before their Holy Maiden in a legitimate ceremony &#x2013; in fact, you suspect that they might be outright offended. Besides, there are still plenty of things you are concerned about. You cannot let marriage tie you down just yet.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b> You tell Master Zhang, Tulu Huodu and Chi Tianxie to fuck off. Who do they think they are, butting into your personal life?<br>
<br>
1. You do it politely.<br>
<br>
2. You do it rudely.

            <h3>五十六 · The Scarlet Scorpion and the Fiery Swordswoman</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Scarlet Scorpion and the Fiery Swordswoman</span></b><br>
<br>
Tulu Huodu gives you an unblinking, golden stare. &#x201C;Yes, I already know that you took over the Fire Temple.&#x201D; Giving the faintest sneer at your surprised face, he continues, &#x201C;I have my resources. Still, that matters little to me. With Ahura&#x2019;s defeat, the change in the Temple&#x2019;s policy meant that they were no longer of any importance. Unless you are planning <i>another </i>invasion of the Central Plains, hm?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It galls you to admit it, but he is right. The Fire Temple may have the stronger fighters, and perhaps more followers to draw upon, but within the Empire itself they could hardly hope to match the influence and power that the Wudu Cult wield under Tulu Huodu, <i>and</i> they had already been beaten back once before at the height of their strength. Given their remote location, any official alliance would be of little benefit to Tulu Huodu: after all, if the Wudu Cult were in danger, you would likely help them even without an alliance, thanks to your ties through Qilin. The sly old snake knows that.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A profitable relationship is still possible&#x2026; but I will not allow the Wudu Cult to become directly subservient to another organization under my niece&#x2019;s watch.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As I said, I propose an equal-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Equality is a <i>lie</i>, young Xu Jing. Regardless of your best-laid plans or intentions, human nature ensures that things will not go the way you wish it to be. If <i>that </i>is how you wish it to be.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, if you are really that unwilling to marry my daughter, I suppose there is no forcing the matter,&#x201D; sighs Chi Tianxie.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, that&#x2019;s not the case,&#x201D; you say hurriedly, &#x201C;<i>Father</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His expression perks up &#x2013; you can tell that he&#x2019;s probably pleased. &#x201C;Are my old ears deceiving me? What did you just say?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You misunderstand my intentions, Father. I do want to marry Qilin. But things are&#x2026; complicated at the moment. I believe my proposal is the best way to make everyone happy.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think so too,&#x201D; adds Qilin, a smile fixed on her face. &#x201C;Father, there is still no hurry. I have established good relations with the other girls, and as I told you before this, they will be powerful, talented allies in the future. Making everyone happy <i>is </i>the most effective plan.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you put it that way&#x2026;&#x201D; mulls Chi Tianxie, a thoughtful look in his eyes.<br>
<br>
Tulu Huodu shakes his head and lets out a groan. &#x201C;You are too soft, Tianxie. I suppose this tiring discussion will be going nowhere. Very well. Let us move on to other matters for now.&#x201D; He glances across the table and says, &#x201C;Qilin.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-yes, uncle?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will be retiring at the next Huashan Summit. I will not be participating. You will carry the banner of the Wudu into that fight, and upon the Summit&#x2019;s conclusion, you will succeed me as the next leader.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin can only offer a cry of shock in return.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Zhang raises his eyebrows, taking an interest in the conversation again. &#x201C;Feeling old, Tulu?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In a way,&#x201D; he smiles slyly, but offers no further explanation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t participate in the Summit, uncle, I&#x2019;m nowhere near strong enough!&#x201D; protests Qilin. &#x201C;It is just a huge waste of time!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Get strong enough. You have the talent to surpass me, but you have neglected training the deeper arts of the Wudu repertoire for a long time now. If you get started at this time, I am sure that with Xu Jing&#x2019;s aid you will be able to improve quickly. Besides, I do not need you to win it. You only need to remind the world that the Wudu Cult will always be able to carry out its principles with or without me. To demonstrate that its future is in good hands.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You <i>need</i> to shape up, dear daughter,&#x201D; says Chi Tianxie concernedly. &#x201C;Putting the question of marriage aside, you are still the heiress of our organization. You need to be able to hold your own.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing.&#x201D; Tulu Huodu addresses you again, while Qilin is stewing silently in frustration. &#x201C;You have until the Summit to decide where you want to take your relationship with Qilin. If you cannot commit, or prove to me that you are right, I would advise you to put an end to the affair. For your own sake.&#x201D; You do not know whether he&#x2019;s delivering a piece of advice or a warning.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will think about it, <i>Uncle </i>Tulu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<i>That</i> gets an actual laugh out of him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Anyway, if I am going to be pressed about my personal affairs, Father,&#x201D; says Qilin suddenly, &#x201C;perhaps you can tell me more about my mother? You know, the one that&#x2019;s now married to Nie Wuxing?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Chi Tianxie&#x2019;s face goes pale. &#x201C;I&#x2026; well&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Tulu Huodu stands up &#x2013; though you can still discern no emotion from him, you get the feeling that he may be just slightly annoyed. &#x201C;This is a private matter. Tianxie, I will leave you to talk about it with Qilin on your own. Zhang, if you wouldn&apos;t mind?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know&#x2026; it may prove to be interesting,&#x201D; grins Master Zhang, lounging in the chair as if he has absolutely no intention to go anywhere.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, very well,&#x201D; sighs Tulu Huodu, as if he knew this was going to happen. &#x201C;I will spar with you for a bit. Is that <i>more </i>interesting?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zhang Jue&#x2019;s eyes twinkle as he gets up slowly. &#x201C;Yes. That <i>would</i> be more interesting, Tulu.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You make to follow them, but Qilin catches your wrist, restraining you. Chi Tianxie gives the both of you a puzzled look. &#x201C;Daughter,&#x201D; he begins. &#x201C;Shouldn&#x2019;t he&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, he is staying here. We are family,&#x201D; she says flatly. &#x201C;Jing, sit down.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You do so obediently.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are such a&#x2026;&#x201D; Chi Tianxie taps his fingers on the table in exasperation before giving up. &#x201C;Alright. Alright.&#x201D; With a heavy sigh, he nods and begins his story.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Our first meeting was about twenty five years ago. I was a renowned troublemaker and rising star of the Wudu Cult back then. Young, handsome, and brash&#x2026; not entirely unlike you, Xu Jing, though of course I am still handsome and brash even if older now. Anyway, our initial encounter was when she raided one of our operation centers, and we fought. We were about equal in prowess, and after some time I decided it would be a smarter use of my time to retreat.<br>
<br>
I did some investigating into her background afterwards. Trying to identify a threat, you know? Found out her name &#x2013; Liao Xiuyue &#x2013; and her background. She was a swordswoman from a minor school in the region, who were affiliated with the Huashan Sect. We crossed paths again and again as she pursued me across the country, together with her Huashan friends. Nie Wuxing, that toady. And of course, Shangguan Chuji, who was a stick of a boy back then and only stayed in the background, never fighting. Who would have thought, eh?<br>
<br>
So&#x2026; she chased me, I fought her&#x2026; and somehow, after a few years, we just&#x2026; got together. I left the Wudu Cult to be with her. We had a little cottage out in the woods. Things were happy, for a while. Of course, someone wasn&#x2019;t, but who cares about <i>him</i>? About a year after you were born, she seemed to be worried about something. Her behaviour changed a bit. She became colder. Sharper. She was always a fiery, clumsy woman, but afterwards&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Well, at any rate, she received a message from her old master, seeking help. She told me that it would be all right, that she could handle it and that she&#x2019;d be back soon. She left. Of course, I went looking for her. I&#x2019;m not sure if you remembered when I left you with your aunt for a few years, Qilin, but during that period of time I was busy searching for your mother. I never found her. It was as if she had vanished off the face of the earth.<br>
<br>
The next time I saw her, she was married to another man. There was&#x2026; well, a confrontation. Huodu had to intervene, and the less said about <i>that </i>event, the better. He was already not very happy when I ran off to be with her, and then came back only to dump a kid in his and Huishe&#x2019;s laps before disappearing again.&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I wouldn&#x2019;t mind if it was a kid as cute as her,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, do you want me to be dumped in your lap? That can be arranged, dear,&#x201D; replies Qilin, placing her arms around you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Please don&#x2019;t do this in front of me,&#x201D; groans her father. &quot;If the two of you can act like this in public, <i>why can&apos;t you just get married already</i>?&quot;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Having told his story, Chi Tianxie quickly takes his leave, evidently feeling a little uncomfortable at having to share the tale. Qilin is quiet.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you alright?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s fine.&#x201D; She smiles slightly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll talk with you later. For now, I need to think.&#x201D; Standing up, she leaves the tea room. You follow her out, but at the entrance you bump into Yifang and Lingshu. They look a bit shaken.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, you&#x2019;re back. Did things not go well with Emei?&#x201D; you venture.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;N-no, it&#x2019;s not that,&#x201D; stutters Yifang. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just that&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think we saw the Southern Maniac and the Western Snake battling in the middle of the street,&#x201D; says Lingshu, still in shock. &#x201C;A-anyway&#x2026; about Emei, they gave us this letter. Oh, and we picked up your sword on the way back.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You thank them for their work. Lingshu hands you a piece of paper, which you take and unfold. Interesting. Emei has decided to appoint you as their legitimate representative at the Ten Swords Conference. As the wielder of the Yuchang Sword, your voice would be Emei&#x2019;s voice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They were happy that you asked us to approach them,&#x201D; explains Yifang. You think that most of the credit in persuading them is probably due to her; these were her ex-colleagues after all, and by all accounts Yifang was very well-loved in Emei. Though, of course, being strict nuns, they would rarely admit it.<br>
<br>
Still, you now had three Great Swords at your disposal. You wonder if it would be a good idea to spread out possession of the swords, passing them on to your allies. Master Zhang had not been all too interested in them; in fact, he seemed more amused at your wedding predicament than your return with two more of those coveted swords. Of course, it was a given that you would return the Qixing Longyuan Sword to Wudang, but as for the others&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
For the Yuchang Sword, you&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Keep it for yourself, as you have been legitimately designated Emei&#x2019;s representative anyway. It is the Great Sword that you have the most experience in using.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Pass it on to Yifang, who would be able to make extremely good use of it as an ex-Emei member and a talented sword user. It might even be more efficient in her hands compared to yours.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Return it to Emei, who are likely to be even more pleased at this gesture. Having the Castration Nuns with you on the island for the conference will be useful.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
For the Chixiao Sword, you&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Keep it for yourself &#x2013; it is a powerful weapon, as evidenced by the Sword Demon using it to slice apart sword <i>qi </i>with ease. With your skill you should be able to use it freely, though it may not suit a couple of your sword moves.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Pass it on to Lingshu; the sword fits her fighting style best, and it would likely increase her combat ability by leaps and bounds, as well as boosting her reputation for when she decides to take back Qingcheng.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Make plans to offer it to Shun or Xiahou Yu, should either of them want it. They may not be the best swordsmen, but the possibility of having their voice added to yours during the conference is a tempting political benefit.

            <h3>五十七 · Yangzhou or Taoying</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Yangzhou or Taoying</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>Seriously</i>? <i>Really</i>? You&#x2019;re giving <i>me </i>the sword?&#x201D; Lingshu is stunned at your offer, clutching at her sleeves as she eyes the Chixiao Sword.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t make me say it twice.&#x201D; You hold out the sword to her. She is utterly ecstatic, for some reason. Taking the sword, she thanks you profusely before throwing her arms around you in a tight hug that squeezes the breath from your lungs. &#x201C;T-that&#x2019;s not being very lady-like,&#x201D; you croak.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, you deserve it,&#x201D; says Lingshu as she flashes a radiant grin. &#x201C;It&#x2026; means a lot to me that you&#x2019;re willing to hand over such a priceless treasure, just so that I can work on getting Qingcheng back.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You think you hear Cao&#x2019;er murmuring something about number five, but it is probably just your imagination.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
With the Qixing Longyuan back in grateful Wudang hands, you were left with the Yuchang Sword which you had carried around for years now. Since Emei has designated you as their representative, you plan to use it as your way in, to enjoy yourself at the conference.<br>
<br>
The day after, Xiahou Yu returns to Yangzhou. You travel to Yuhua Hall together with Shun to pay him a visit&#x2026; and also to get the money that they owe you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You look well, Your Majesty,&#x201D; bows Yu politely. &#x201C;And it has been too long, Jing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sorry,&#x201D; you say, &#x201C;Palace politics give me a nasty itch, so I prefer not to hang around the capital too much.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun laughs. &#x201C;Is that why you used to scratch vigorously together with the chambermaids? Anyway, where is your wife and her servant? I do not see them around.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They are at the marketplace. Chanfeng is picking out the dishes for dinner.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You whistle. &#x201C;That woman&#x2019;s really settled down. I&#x2019;ve got to hand to you, my scholar friend.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a depreciating chuckle, Xiahou Yu shakes his head. &#x201C;It is better if she doesn&#x2019;t get involved in any further violence. She can become rather&#x2026; unstable. I&#x2019;m helping her forget about the past, but it is still a work in progress.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Have you heard about the user of the Chengying Sword?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I have. The sword itself matters little to me, but the wielder, on the other hand&#x2026; well, let&#x2019;s just say it is interesting that the blade resurfaced in the hands of the Zhang clan,&#x201D; replies Xiahou Yu. You can hear a slight tinge of vengeful anger in his voice.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Keep your emotions in check, Xiahou. I have reminded you before that Zhang Minyue is a poor target to start with. Do not approach her. Now, what of the matter that His Majesty requested you to investigate?&#x201D; interjects Gao Ying.<br>
<br>
Xiahou Yu gives him a calm stare &#x2013; the two still do not get along well, it seems &#x2013; and says, &#x201C;I was about to get to that. Your Majesty, it was impossible to find out anything from the scholars currently on Taoying Island. Their lips are tightly sealed. I felt it rather strange and suspicious, to be honest. Investigating the servants further, however, there is a possibility that the host might be someone who identifies as Lady Ji&#x2019;s sister.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Lady Ji of Luoying Manor. As I suspected. What do you think about this, as a former fellow of Luoying? Is it plausible?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; would not know. She did not seem like the sort to have any family. Or at least, any <i>living </i>family. Your Majesty, please reconsider your visit.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have to agree with Xiahou Yu. Please reconsider, Your Majesty.&#x201D; Gao Ying adds a word of support, cautioning Shun. &#x201C;I do not think it wise to put your royal personage in potential danger. Remember, your father did burn down Luoying Manor. This may be a trap.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You might die,&#x201D; you say bluntly. &#x201C;Are you certain about this, Shun?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you &#x2013; all of you &#x2013; implying that you are too inept to protect me?&#x201D; he laughs. &#x201C;Well, if I die, then that is all I amounted to. But I cannot run an empire with so-called immortals and deities undermining my rule every step of the way. If it <i>is </i>true that there is such a person involved, I need to meet with them. An equitable discussion is not such a bad idea. My father handled these affairs at the point of the sword. I expect they might find a different approach refreshing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You might die,&#x201D; you repeat again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are <i>such </i>a nag. I am not too worried about that,&#x201D; he grins confidently. &#x201C;Anyway, I have spoken. I, the Emperor. If I have to pull rank to get all of you to listen to my wishes, that is what I will do.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You know that there is no stopping him once he is fully convinced of his course. There would be no point &#x2013; Shun has likely considered his options more thoroughly than you have. If he is confident that he will not come to harm, then you will believe him. You will just have to support him as best as you can.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Qi Liuwu and Jiu Mou arrive a couple of days before the conference is due to start, bearing some bad news with them. It seems that the Beggar Chief has decided to make the first move. Knowing that Qi has been attempting to undermine his alliance with Nie Wuxing together with Jiu Mou, he has declared the both of them enemies of the Beggar Sect. He had also found out that they would be in Yangzhou, and even now he was leading an army of beggars from the north to invade the city and destroy Qi Liuwu&#x2019;s base of support.<br>
<br>
On his part, he seems determined to make a stand here; he is not letting anyone push him around anymore, and here he has the manpower to put up a good fight. The arrival of the beggar army would coincide with the Ten Swords Conference; thanks to your commitment there, you will probably miss out on the beggars&#x2019; civil war.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about me, kid. With those kicks you taught me, I can handle myself in a fight. Besides, Mou here is pretty good too,&#x201D; chuckles Qi Liuwu as he deftly brings a gourd of wine to his mouth using his feet. He has passed on to you the Xianglong Eighteen Palms&apos; full set of moves; you were still unfamiliar with the latter half, but for now, you have memorized every stance the technique has to offer.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps I should stay here instead of attending the conference, Master Qi,&#x201D; says Murong Yandi. The Sword Saint&#x2019;s disciple had been travelling with the former head beggar, to your surprise.<br>
<br>
Qi Liuwu shakes his head. &#x201C;No, no. Nie Wuxing is going to open his big braggart mouth and spew nonsense all over the table. We need as many people there as we can to shut him up. Don&#x2019;t worry about me. Go to the conference.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about your master?&#x201D; you ask. There was no sign of the Sword Saint at all. &#x201C;Is he not coming?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, my master is feeling&#x2026; a little under the weather,&#x201D; says Murong nervously. &#x201C;He is currently resting in a small hut outside the city&#x2026; he says the city air disagrees with him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; murmurs Zhang Jue. He stands up, glowering down at Murong Yandi. &#x201C;I will go keep him company, then. This better not be another excuse of his to duck out of a fight&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are really a battle maniac, aren&#x2019;t you, Jue?&#x201D; says Qi Liuwu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would pay you more attention had you still kept your arms, Master Qi,&#x201D; sneers Zhang. &#x201C;Do not be jealous. After all, what use are my techniques if I cannot test it on a worthy opponent?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After almost strangling the location of the hut out of Yandi, Zhang leaves, presumably to check on Shangguan Chuji.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;By the way,&#x201D; you ask, &#x201C;has your master ever taken in a female disciple?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No,&#x201D; replies Murong Yandi, puzzled. &#x201C;Not that I remember. I am his sole disciple.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really? I met this girl the other day, by the name of Zhang Minyue. She&#x2019;s claiming to be the Sword Saint&#x2019;s disciple, and she knew at least one of his moves.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yandi&#x2019;s face scrunches up in perplexity. &#x201C;That can&#x2019;t be. I have no recollection of&#x2026; wait, Minyue? Yue? Xiaoyue? Could it be&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He brightens up, having found the answer. &#x201C;I remember now. Xiaoyue! She was with us a year ago, but as a servant. My master has never been one to tidy up after himself, and it was getting tiresome. I complained to him. I&#x2019;m not sure where he picked her up from, but he showed up with a girl one day and said that she was going to wash our clothes, do the dishes, and take care of the cooking. At first I was worried that he&apos;d kidnapped her from somewhere, but the girl assured me that she came willingly.&quot; He pauses for a while, looking concerned. &quot;She wasn&#x2019;t an actual disciple, though. We never officially taught her anything.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps she stole some of your master&#x2019;s moves,&#x201D; you suggest.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps.&#x201D; He shrugs. &#x201C;Master Shangguan has always been rather careless with his techniques, to be honest. You saw it for yourself. It doesn&#x2019;t really matter to us. As long as she uses it for good and not evil, we will say nothing. More importantly, she really wasn&apos;t kidnapped, right? Right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It seems that <i>that </i>is what he is more concerned about.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; you shake your head, being careful to keep a blank expression. &quot;No. I don&apos;t think so.&quot;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Given the impending confrontation between the factions of the Beggars&#x2019; Sect, you wonder if you should have any of your friends assist Qi Liuwu and the beggars, instead of accompanying you to the island. Song Lingshu will definitely be going with you as the new wielder of the Chixiao Sword, while Xuezi has insisted that she be taken along. That left&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Qilin:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You have her stay behind to use her connections, poison expertise, and trapping skills to aid Qi Liuwu.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You bring her with you to Taoying Island. You would feel safer with her around; her wits and skill at detecting poison might be invaluable.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You send her over to the Sword Saint to check on his condition. If he really is sick, Cao&#x2019;er will definitely be able to do something about it. Improving his health should be one of your priorities.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You bring her with you to Taoying Island: she will not be very happy if something like the incident in the palace tunnel recurs to keep you two apart, and her ability at healing could save lives in an emergency.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Yifang:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You have her talk to the nuns, to enlist their aid for Qi Liuwu. Though they would usually not be willing to interfere in an internal dispute of another sect, Yifang might be able to coax them into changing their minds. She would have to stay behind to consolidate their support, however.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You bring her with you to Taoying Island. Her swordsmanship is extremely good, and if it comes down to a fight, having her around would be a great boon.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Yunzi and Armaiti &#x2013; the Earth Amesha Spenta cannot leave the Holy Maiden&apos;s side:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You have them stay with Qi Liuwu, for extra firepower.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You bring them with you to Taoying Island, for extra firepower.

            <h3>五十八 · The Ten Swords Conference</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Ten Swords Conference</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hurry, hurry,&#x201D; urges the boatman. &#x201C;Your group is the last to leave.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The scholars of Taoying Island had arranged for boats to depart from Yangzhou harbour. Even amongst the myriad ships and lively bustle of the busy port, those boats stood out. Tall and black-sailed, you could have spotted them from a distance away. Of course, now there is only one left: the rest of the boats had already departed earlier in the day. Your group is travelling light &#x2013; the baggage is stowed away quickly, and before long you are on your way. Shun, Xiahou Yu, Gao Ying and Xiaofang had left by separate means, not being actual invitees.<br>
<br>
Lingshu appears to be rather excited about the trip, to the extent of singing out loud some weird song she coined up about meting out justice as a wandering exemplar of gallantry. Surprisingly, she has managed to drag Yunzi and Armaiti into singing along with her. If Yifang had come along, there was no doubt she would have been pushed into joining in too.<br>
<br>
However, there are more important tasks for her to handle. Yifang had agreed readily enough to speak to the nuns again. They might not be allowed to help openly in the beggars&#x2019; internal strife, but if Qi Liuwu looked like he was in danger, they would at least act to save his life. Yifang herself would stay back and assist him in his efforts. You had also asked her to check in on Cao&#x2019;er, to ensure that her sister was safe until you return. Perhaps this will be a good bonding opportunity.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er, on the other hand&#x2026; well, she was obedient enough, but you get the feeling that you would pay for leaving her on the mainland when you return.<br>
<br>
The boat shakes as it moves over a particularly rough patch of sea. You look over at Xuezi. Her doll-like face is at peace, her eyes closed. Xuezi has been meditating throughout the trip. According to her, Luoying Manor had existed even during her time. It is possible that if this place is a successor to Luoying Manor, its archives could hold the relevant fragments of the Jiuyin Manual that could unlock her power. To that end, she is prepared to take the risk of forcing open the seals temporarily if need be, to get what she wants. The meditation is a means of making that process go more smoothly. You do not disturb her.<br>
<br>
Then, you turn to Qilin. She looks pensive, and you know what bothers her, after last night&#x2019;s talk. Liao Xiuyue &#x2013; Madam Nie will certainly be there, accompanying Nie Wuxing. This will be the first time that she stands in front of her mother. After hearing about her father&#x2019;s tale, it is only natural that she would feel worried. You yourself are uncertain about how things would play out. Reaching out, your fingers find hers, and you take her hand. Surprised, she looks at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. We&#x2019;ll handle this together.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She wags a finger at you. &#x201C;Good, I&#x2019;m counting on that. Just don&#x2019;t anger your mother-in-law unless it&#x2019;s for a reason. I suppose it&#x2019;s a good thing  that <i>you </i>don&#x2019;t have any overbearing in-laws that I have to deal with.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, I&#x2019;m coming in baggage free. My parents, and any relatives I might have&#x2026; they might as well be dead to me. All of the trouble is on <i>your</i> side,&#x201D; you grin.<br>
<br>
Qilin laughs softly. &#x201C;I suppose so. Well, we will get through this somehow, the two of us. Anyway, I&#x2019;ve been thinking. After this, maybe&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She shakes her head, changing her mind. &#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s nothing. I mean, I&#x2019;ll tell you after the conference. That&#x2019;s what we should focus on for now.&#x201D; Standing up, she untwines her fingers from yours gently, and goes to join in the singing&#x2026; where Lingshu is stretching out the song of righteousness to such an extent that, having run out of great misdeeds to apply justice to, they&#x2019;re now singing about saving cats and arresting adulterers.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Taoying Island is much smaller than Yinhu Island; it was perhaps similarly sized as Tielou Island, where you had first met the Minamoto. The mansion itself stands majestically atop the sheer cliffs of the north face, built of brick and wood. You think that the view must be stunning from there. Thanks to some rough weather impeding your passage, you have arrived far later than the others. It took you the better part of the day to reach the island: when you had left it was late morning, but the sun is already setting by the time the boat finally docks at the small jetty nestled at the foot of the cliffs.<br>
<br>
The boatman does not lead you up, but points towards a path winding up to the top. Steps have been cut into the rock. It is a rather steep climb, but none of your party would be unable to do it, even in the fading light. Almost none, you correct yourself, when you see Xuezi holding out her arms.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you want it piggy-back or bridal style?&#x201D; you sigh, walking over to her. As it turns out, she prefers the latter.<br>
<br>
At the end of the climb, you arrive at the gates of the mansion. The lights are on, and you can hear the noise of festivities from the inside. It looks like you are just in time for dinner. After seeing your sword, the servants usher you in quickly, leading you to the main hall.<br>
<br>
When you appear at the entrance of the hall, the noise dies down. You grin, still carrying Xuezi in your arms.<br>
<br>
Shun and his entourage are already here, sitting near Guo Fu and the three Wu brothers.<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi is sitting by himself, looking alone and uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai look at you for only a second before quietly returning to their meal.<br>
<br>
On the other side of the hall are Nie Wuxing and his followers, collectively glaring at you. Zhang Minyue is with them; she has dropped her chopsticks in surprise, her mouth agape. Both Su Cheng of Kunlun and Liu Ye of Taishan are also here, as are their best disciples, Liu Qi and Su Liaojing. The Taishan Seven have occupied a table all to themselves. Bai Jiutian, the Twin Flowers and Madam Nie are sitting at the side. You wink at Bai, and she scowls at you in return. Nie Mudan and Nie Shuixian whisper amongst themselves, darting suspicious glances at you. Madam Nie, on the other hand&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Well, it&#x2019;s clear where Qilin gets her looks from, and it&#x2019;s certainly not her father.<br>
<br>
She is staring right at you&#x2026; no, right past you. You glance behind briefly, and see the object of her gaze. It is not surprising at all; she is looking at her daughter, and Qilin is making a point of not staring back &#x2013; <i>her </i>gaze is fixed on you.<br>
<br>
You look around the hall again. This is certainly going to be a troublesome conference.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
At the end of the meal, everyone retires to their chambers. It did not take long before every one of your friends are gathered in <i>your </i>chamber. Apparently you had missed a quick briefing at the start of the dinner, where the veiled host had shown off the Xuanyuan Sword to prove that it was in her possession.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Even with that veil, I can tell that it was not Lady Ji,&#x201D; says Xiahou Yu firmly. &#x201C;The rumours of the host being her sister might be true.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Regardless, Wudang stands with you,&#x201D; says Wu Jin, the eldest of the three brothers. &#x201C;We would not have a voice in the first place had you not slain the Sword Demon and returned to us our sect&#x2019;s treasure.&#x201D; It looks like they have agreed to entrust you with the lead.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll back your words too,&#x201D; offers Murong Yandi. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t receive any instruction from my master other than to attend, and to be honest the other group rather irritates me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Together with Lingshu and you, it means that four of the Great Sword wielders have formed a bloc. There are nine present: the others would be Nie Wuxing, Liu Qi, Zhang Minyue, Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai. Of those, you expect Zuo and his wife to stand together, though whose side they would fall on is another matter. Instead of his master, Liu Qi appears to be the designated wielder of Taishan&#x2019;s sword, as recognized by the host. You are still unsure what to push for at the actual conference tomorrow.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know Liu Qi,&#x201D; says Lingshu. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve sparred a few times before this, as representatives of our sects. Perhaps I can talk to him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There is a knock at the door. Xiaofang goes to open it, and upon seeing the visitor, she &#x2013; no, <i>he</i>, you remind yourself &#x2013; calls out, &#x201C;Xu Jing, there is a w&#x2026; wait, I mean&#x2026; someone is looking for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You head for the door, passing by a puzzled Xiaofang.<br>
<br>
In front of you stands Bai Jiutian, in full male mode. She seems to be puffing out her chest more than usual, standing masculinely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hello,&#x201D; you smile in greeting. &#x201C;Do you want to join us?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perish the thought,&#x201D; she sniffs. &#x201C;I am here because my master has a message for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I hope it&#x2019;s nothing rude.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He is a gentleman, unlike you. My master is offering a meeting tonight, at the courtyard pavilion. He wants to discuss the conference tomorrow peaceably &#x2013; he says that he knows you are not here to make trouble, and would like things to be resolved amicably. It will just be you, <i>shifu </i>and <i>shimu</i>. Of course, you can bring along that Wudu girl if you want. That was what my <i>shimu </i>added.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, <i>that&#x2019;s</i> interesting,&#x201D; says Qilin, standing behind you. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s so interesting that I would be interested.<br>
<br>
Bai&#x2019;s gaze drifts towards her. &#x201C;Yes. I suppose it is.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After telling you that Nie Wuxing would be at the pavilion about an hour later regardless of what you choose to do, Bai Jiutian takes her leave as quickly as she came.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You meet with Nie Wuxing. Qilin is not likely to stay away even if you tell her to, so you will have to bring her along. Regardless of Nie&#x2019;s plans, you think it is probably best to hear out what he has to say - it is likely to be important.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You go with Lingshu to meet Liu Qi. If you can sway him away from supporting his master, you would gain the majority in this conference, as well as obtain another orthodox ally on your side.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You head off to meet with Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai. Perhaps you can talk them into supporting you by providing them with an update on their children&#x2019;s situation. Yunzi seems to be interested in going along for this one.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You venture out to look for Zhang Minyue. She does not seem to be wholly tied to Nie&#x2019;s group, and as you saved her life before, she might be partial to listening to you. You might even gain an insight about the Zhang clan&#x2019;s goals. Murong Yandi would likely go along with you if you wanted.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You attempt to find the mysterious hostess of the conference, and perhaps the Xuanyuan Sword. If you can steal it before the conference tomorrow, you will have won before it has even started. Xuezi is willing to back you up here with her full strength, if necessary - she likes the direct approach.

            <h3>五十九 · The Ten Swords Conference II</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Ten Swords Conference II</span></b><br>
<br>
The garden, one of many within the compound, is filled with the song of crickets. You walk with Qilin towards the small pavilion by the pond. Under the waning moon, you can hardly see her expression. The pavilion is lit up by small lanterns hanging from the roof. Nie Wuxing and his wife are sitting there, engaged in idle chatter while she tidies his graying hair. You cast a look around, wondering if Bai Jiutian is spying on you from somewhere. If she is, you see no sign of her. When Nie Wuxing sees you, he rises from his seat, spreading his hands outwards in a gesture of openness. &#x201C;Young Master Xu. It is good that you decided to accept my invitation.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Inclining your head slightly, you say, &#x201C;It would be remiss of me not to offer my respects to the esteemed leader of the orthodox world and his beautiful lady.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well met, Xu Jing. I am pleased to see you too, Qilin,&#x201D; smiles Madam Nie softly. Her tone of voice and demeanour lack the sly sharpness that you had encountered while eavesdropping that night in Huashan: she seems to be every bit a gentle, lovely matron.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Madam Nie, the pleasure is all mine,&#x201D; beams Qilin.<br>
<br>
You notice Madam Nie frowning slightly, but her expression clears up in the next second. &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; she chuckles, &#x201C;it would be too soon to expect you to call me mother, wouldn&#x2019;t it? I have hardly been there for you after all. Well, no matter. Come, don&#x2019;t just stand there. There is room to sit.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After the Nie couple settle down opposite you and Qilin, you speak. &#x201C;Why have I been summoned, Master Nie?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was just a friendly invitation, not a summoning at all. Let us talk as peers, about the upcoming sword conference,&#x201D; says Nie affably.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s good. For a moment I was worried that you still held a grudge against me for stripping one of your daughters,&#x201D; you grin, and all that affableness disappears in a flash.<br>
<br>
The crickets cease their chirping as Nie Wuxing stares at you, glowering. He grits his teeth and growls, &#x201C;Man Tiger Pig, you-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
There is the sound of a shoe tapping on the ground once. Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s eyes dart towards Madam Nie for a second, and he coughs, composing himself and stroking his well-groomed beard &#x201C;Right. Let&#x2026; let bygones be bygones. I am sure it was just the folly of youth.&#x201D; Laughing awkwardly, he takes a deep breath before continuing. &#x201C;Xu Jing, I am sure you are aware of the importance of this conference. It is not just about the <i>jianghu</i>. No, these legendary swords are treasures that represent the values of our country and people. Righteousness. Nobility. Fighting against tyranny. Of these, the Xuanyuan Sword is the most important of all not because of its power but because it symbolizes the right to rule. We cannot simply hand it over to anybody. None of us here at the conference have the right to wield it&#x2026; under Heaven, there is only one man worthy of that sword.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You offer up a name. &#x201C;Zhang Manlou?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The expression on Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s face is rather enjoyable to behold as his dignified lecture comes grinding to a halt. &#x201C;W-what are you talking about? That is&#x2026; that is <i>treason</i>! Do not say such things, even as a joke!&#x201D; he sputters. &#x201C;Of course I mean our great Emperor! Who else would I be talking about?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I believe you have many misunderstandings about us, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Madam Nie. &#x201C;Do you think that we seek to overthrow the Emperor, or to cause him harm in any way? We do not. We are loyal to him and his rule. But the Emperor is surrounded by sycophants and foolish advisors, and if we do not deal with these pests they will do irreversible damage to the Empire.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Removing them is our duty, as responsible members of the pugilistic world and loyal servants of the Emperor,&#x201D; declares Nie Wuxing. &#x201C;All that we have done thus far, we do for the sake of the country.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You do not see exactly how they have contributed, to be honest. Still, you are not here to argue their motives. That would be rather futile at the moment. &#x201C;Does this mean that you will call for the Xuanyuan Sword to be given to the Emperor?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. That is what I will do tomorrow,&#x201D; nods Nie Wuxing. &#x201C;My partners have agreed with my course of action. I was worried that you would have ideas of your own, but my wife pointed out to me your acts of service to the Tang. I knew then that you are a patriot, just like me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Acts&#x2026; of service?&#x201D; How much <i>do </i>they know?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You were raised as the prince&#x2019;s right-hand man, were you not? It is a pity you did not come to Huashan when you were sent away; we could have raised you to greater heights,&#x201D; smiles Nie. &#x201C;Your recent actions in Youxia were also&#x2026; interesting, to say the least. So, what do you say? Will you join me in serving the Emperor&#x2019;s cause tomorrow? I know you have influence over a few others&#x2026; your assistance will serve to make tomorrow&#x2019;s conference merely a formality.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Emperor is in Chang&#x2019;an,&#x201D; Qilin points out. &#x201C;How would you get the sword to him, Master Nie?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course, I would gladly take the duty of transporting it. Huashan is the nearest sect to Chang&#x2019;an. It would not be out of our way to do so.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You let out a short laugh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is something the matter?&#x201D; frowns Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s nothing. Do you expect me to make a decision right now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is unnecessary. I just need you to think about this proposal, Xu Jing. It would be very helpful to your reputation.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
And his, you think, but you do not say it to his face. &#x201C;Very well. I will think about it,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Excellent! I am so glad that you see reason, unlike your master.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, he sees reason too. He usually finds it in the guts of people.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;R-right. Yes.&#x201D; Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s expression grows dark &#x2013; it is not exactly fear... hatred? Disgust? &#x201C;I recall hearing that he came with you to Yangzhou. It looks like he has not come to the island.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My dear,&#x201D; interrupts Madam Nie, &#x201C;you think about Zhang Jue too much. Still, now that we have time to talk about other things, I <i>am </i>curious about one thing. Qilin?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin looks at her mother, her face a mask of polite sweetness. &#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I heard that you have been with Xu Jing for quite some time now. Are the two of you planning on getting married any time soon?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Oh no, not another one.<br>
<br>
Qilin shakes her head politely. &#x201C;It is not time yet. The both of us have too much to do. When the time is right&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is not good,&#x201D; mutters Madam Nie, frowning. She raises her finger at you. &#x201C;Xu Jing, I would appreciate it if you do not toy around with my daughter. I have heard&#x2026; rumours of your philandering ways. In fact, I have seen evidence of it first-hand.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wh-what?&#x201D; explodes Nie Wuxing, rising to his feet. &#x201C;First-hand! Did he lay a hand on the twins?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can assure you that I haven&#x2019;t,&#x201D; you say, raising your hands. Not the twins, at least.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now, dear, calm down,&#x201D; sighs Madam Nie as she coaxes him down. &#x201C;It was an acquaintance of mine. You would not know her&#x2026; but I am sure Xu Jing does. Quite intimately. Count yourself lucky that you have not sired a bastard child, young man.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t help it if my darling is popular with women,&#x201D; smirks Qilin. &#x201C;It only enhances my own reputation further.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is what you say now, dear daughter.&#x201D; Madam Nie shakes her head a bit wistfully. &#x201C;If you do not marry, it will all be for naught. Did you know that your father never married me?&#x201D; At the mention of Chi Tianxie, Nie Wuxing looks away, evidently displeased. Madam Nie ignores him and continues on. &#x201C;We lived together but he never officially took me as his wife. He always had other women on the side. I do not know what stories he told you, but I only left him because I had to.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s rather easy for you to say at this point, Madam Nie,&#x201D; Qilin shrugs. She does not deny the accusations of her father&#x2019;s infidelity, however. You wonder if it is true.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know I haven&#x2019;t been there for you all these years, but I and Wuxing tried to get you back when you were but a babe.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, we did,&#x201D; confirms her husband. &#x201C;We confronted Chi Tianxie to obtain custody of you, but Tulu Huodu intervened.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Even at that time he had decided that you would be his heir, and he would not let you go no matter how I pleaded,&#x201D; says Madam Nie sadly. &#x201C;I had my reasons.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Everyone has their reasons. I have chosen my path&#x2026; I will not be swayed from it at this point, Madam Nie.&#x201D; Qilin&#x2019;s voice is quiet but full of resolution as she holds your hand under the table. You give her an encouraging squeeze in return.<br>
<br>
Madam Nie lets out a heavy sigh. &#x201C;That it may be&#x2026; but the two of you should heed my words and marry as quickly as possible. Who knows what could happen in the near future&#x2026; even tomorrow? Life is short. For example, what would you do if my husband offered you Shuixian and Mudan in marriage as a show of his desire to be your comrade?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I never-&#x201C; begins Nie, but a glance from his wife cuts him off. He nods. &#x201C;There would have to be some preparations to be done, but to be honest, I&#x2026; I think you have the potential&#x2026; to be a good&#x2026; ally.&#x201D; He seems almost pained to speak those words &#x2013; you have doubt if he believes it himself &#x2013; but he forces them out anyway. &#x201C;Not <i>both</i>, of course. No. That would be improper. My best disciple, Bai Jiutian, will take one of them as his wife.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You cannot believe that the Nie couple are making such an offer. It isn&#x2019;t like you succumb to <i>any </i>maiden you come across &#x2013; you even feel slightly angry on the twins&#x2019; behalf, at having such parents. &#x201C;Hm.&#x201D; You turn to Qilin. There is an amused smile on her lips. &#x201C;What should I do? They&#x2019;re offering me twins.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be greedy, darling, you already have a set at home. How are you going to take care of another?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I only said <i>one</i>!&#x201D; growls Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am sorry, Master Nie,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;I just cannot take this proposal seriously. I mean no offense to the Twin Flowers, for they have indeed blossomed into ladies befitting their name, but you must have forgotten who I am.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Man Tiger Pig cannot be tied down by anyone or anything,&#x201D; chuckles Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And so I must respectfully decline, Master Nie,&#x201D; you bow. &#x201C;They would not be happy with me. Well&#x2026; until the first night comes around, that is&#x2026; but you know what I mean.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As you expected, he is forced to choke back his rage even as he glares at you.<br>
<br>
It seems that there is nothing else that they have to say. Promising that you will give his proposal due consideration, you leave the pavilion &#x2013; Nie Wuxing is red-faced and not entirely happy, while Madam Nie is looking at you and Qilin thoughtfully, not anywhere near as ruffled as her husband is. You are unable to guess what she is thinking at all.<br>
<br>
You enjoy the quiet walk back to your chambers with Qilin. &#x201C;They might still be plotting something,&#x201D; mutters Qilin, biting her lip. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s all there is to their plan.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Whatever it is, we will see how it goes tomorrow,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Get a good night&#x2019;s sleep. I&#x2019;ll be back in a while.&#x201D; You kiss Qilin on the cheek and pat her on the bum, sending her swaying on her way. She seems to be rather pleased; there is a spring in her step. On your part, you wonder what you should do next. At this unearthly hour everyone should be fast asleep, but you are feeling full of energy tonight&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You head off to have a last minute discussion of Nie&#x2019;s proposal with Shun: there is no guarantee you can meet up with him tomorrow. If you can manage to convince Shun to reveal himself right after Nie makes his argument, you can end the conference quickly and easily by placing the Xuanyuan Sword into his hands. Still, you are not sure if it is safe for him to do so&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You sneak into Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s room once again, planning to wake her up for a late night chat. Perhaps she might be able to give you a bit more insight on what her master and mistress have in mind &#x2013; it all seems too noble for you to believe. You need more information before the conference begins, and she can give it to you.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You attempt to find out more about the mansion and its hostess &#x2013; you have not yet gotten a glimpse of the Xuanyuan Sword nor of the veiled lady who claims to be Lady Ji&#x2019;s sister. A night raid might yield surprising results for you.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You think you are better off spending your time in bed, resting in preparation for tomorrow. Sleep is very important. You don&apos;t want to doze off at the table tomorrow, after all, or - Heaven forbid - wake up late.

            <h3>六十 · The Ten Swords Conference III</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Ten Swords Conference III</span></b><br>
<br>
Morning comes, and with it the day of the conference. You are awake and ready even before the knock at the door comes: a servant has been sent to guide you to the main hall. It seems that the meeting will start together with breakfast. The covers of the bed shift lazily as its occupant refuses to get up. You should probably wake her.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You meet up with the others in front of the main hall &#x2013; it seems that all of them have gotten a good night&#x2019;s rest. Nie Wuxing gives you a polite salute. Smiling, you return the courtesy. He seems a lot calmer this morning, striking a pose of quiet confidence.<br>
<br>
Soon, the doors open. As you enter, you see that the tables have been arranged around a central dais, upon which a long copper sword has been laid on a soft cushion of silk. Besides you, you can hear Nie Wuxing whisper, &#x201C;The Xuanyuan Sword&#x2026;&#x201D; It is polished to the extent that its surface could be used as a mirror. Both the blade and hilt are lined with precious gems that sparkle in the morning light. The design evokes a grand feeling of power and authority &#x2013; it is certainly fit for a ruler&#x2019;s hand. A strange feeling wells forth from deep inside you. There is something about the sword that feels&#x2026; odd.<br>
<br>
The veiled hostess is seated on a platform at the end of the hall. A large, beautifully-carved zither lies in front of her. From here you cannot make out any of her features, but her build is tall and slender. She raises one elegant hand towards you. &#x201C;What is the matter, wielder of the Yuchang Sword? Why do you not take your seat?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look around you.  All of the other sword-holders are already in their designated places, their Great Swords placed on top of their tables. Even the audience, here to witness the sword&#x2019;s handover, have been seated. Nie Wuxing is glaring at you for holding up the proceedings. Walking over to your table, you place the Yuchang Sword on top of it. But you do not sit.<br>
<br>
Looking up, you grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is no need for me to sit down. This will be settled before my feet start to ache.&#x201D; You call out to those assembled here, reaching out with both hands. &#x201C;We are all aware of the importance of this conference! This is not just about the <i>jianghu</i>, and those that dwell within it. No, this is far more important than that. The legendary swords that lie before all of you are <i>treasures</i> that represent the heart of our country and our people, from the highest nobility to the lowest peasantry!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s eyes widen, his mouth left hanging open as he realizes the familiar words you are speaking. &#x201C;Wait-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
With a gleeful smile, you speak over him, raising your voice. &#x201C;Mercy! Courage! Love! All of you have come to bear these swords because you feel these virtues deeply within you. I am sure that none of you would wield your blades under a lie&#x2026; and so it is that even <i>I</i> must speak the truth on a day such as this. The Xuanyuan Sword is the sword of rulership. Holding a conference to pick its wielder from amongst us is &#x2013; <i>in truth </i>&#x2013; a waste of time. None of us are rulers. None of us possess the divine right to lord over the masses. From the very beginning, there has only been one truth! That under Heaven, there is only <i>one </i>person that is worthy of the Xuanyuan Sword. It belongs to the Son of Heaven!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Slamming your palms down on the table to make your point, you glance at Nie Wuxing. &#x201C;Am I wrong, Master Nie? As the leader of the orthodox sects, will you stand with me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; He tugs at his beard annoyedly, gulping back some choice words you think would ruin his gentlemanly image; you can guess that he is rather displeased that you stole his big moment. &#x201C;Yes, I do. I have to agree with Xu Jing. In fact, I have had similar thoughts-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As expected of the respected leader of the Eight Sects! May we all applaud his wisdom and foresight. Is there anyone else who would disagree that the Xuanyuan Sword is the property of the Emperor?&#x201D; you call out, cutting Nie Wuxing off before he can finish.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;For the Emperor!&#x201D; shouts Shun anonymously from the sidelines. &#x201C;Long live the Emperor!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A split second later, the hall is filled with the sounds of people hailing the Emperor as loudly as they can, cheering for a man that is not present &#x2013; as far as they know &#x2013; in the hall. Nie Wuxing is continuing to send his glares your way. Bai Jiutian gives you a subtle nod, and besides her, Madam Nie&#x2019;s expression remains unchanged; it is calm and collected. Does that mean their plans are unchanged even if you take the credit? Perhaps. The crucial bit comes right after this.<br>
<br>
As the cheers die down, Nie Wuxing speaks up again. &#x201C;A marvellous display of patriotism, Xu Jing... no, from everyone present.&#x201D; He appears to have fully composed himself. Nodding at you approvingly, he says, &#x201C;I feel proud to be in such company. Still, the Emperor is far away in Chang&#x2019;an, while the sword is here, on Taoying Island. The journey is long and arduous; we cannot expect His Majesty to make such a gruelling trip across the country. I suggest that we convey it to him, as a gesture of our undying loyalty. To that end, I would like to propose my humble self to escort the sword. Does anyone have any disagreements?&#x201D; Nie Wuxing looks at you as he asks that question, smiling. He probably wants to claw back as much public spotlight as he can.<br>
<br>
If he is confident enough to still make that proposal, you wonder what he has planned. Should he lose the sword on the way to Chang&#x2019;an &#x2013; by design or by accident &#x2013; it would ruin his reputation severely, not to mention making him directly accountable for the sword&#x2019;s loss in the Emperor&apos;s eyes. Perhaps he does not desire the sword?<br>
<br>
You are unsure. There is too little to go on right now. You wonder if you should let him play his move unchecked&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You argue that this is a gesture from the wielders of the Great Swords, and so it is only fair and right that <i>all </i>of them make the trip to Chang&#x2019;an to present the sword together. You are aware that not everyone might be able to make the trip, but those who can, should. With such a large group of people &#x2013; plus everyone waiting for you back on the mainland &#x2013; it would be near impossible for Nie&#x2019;s people to pull off anything.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You openly agree with Nie Wuxing. Let him have his escort duty. You just need to keep track of him after the conference. Allowing him to relax his guard and subsequently tailing him in secret might even yield you more information than you would have otherwise.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You argue for Guo Fu to be the primary escort for the sword. The Wudang Sect still retains an impeccable reputation. Of the sword-holders you can trust, compared to Song Lingshu, who is currently an outcast from Qingcheng, and Murong Yandi, whose master may be apolitical but is decidedly eccentric, Guo Fu&#x2019;s respectability is your best shot here. Pitting his reputation against Nie&#x2019;s is a hard task, but you have to try anyway.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You point out that the Emperor is already here. You are revealing Shun&#x2019;s identity without his permission, but at this point it is now the quickest way to pass the sword into his hands and resolve the entire conference for good. He&apos;ll understand.

					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Ten Swords Conference IV</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hold it!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s jaw sets, his face frozen in an expression of extreme irritation. &#x201C;What is it now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your humble offer is a shining example of gallantry, but it is not right for the rest of us to stand by and allow you to shoulder this task alone. As fellow wielders of the Ten Great Swords, it is only fair that we assist you in this task, Master Nie. Is that not the righteous path?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, Wudang stands ready to assist at any time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I, Song Lingshu, would be pleased to help!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;I would have to ask my master first, but I think it would be the right thing for me to do.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Voices of support for your idea begin rising from your allies amongst the sword-holders.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I agree with Xu Jing. As the representative of Emei, he has spoken well,&#x201D; says Liu Qi. Nie doesn&#x2019;t turn to look at him, but his master. Su Cheng appears to be aghast at his disciple speaking out of turn. The Taishan swordsman continues, &#x201C;However, even if we go together, <i>someone </i>must carry the sword. When you consider seniority and respectability, out of everyone in this hall there is no other man more qualified than Master Nie of Huashan.&#x201D; Both Nie Wuxing and Su Cheng look rather relieved at Liu Qi&#x2019;s conclusion.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am with Brother Liu Qi on this.&#x201D; Zhang Minyue finally says something; she has been rather subdued thus far. &#x201C;Master Nie&#x2019;s reputation is impeccable. If anyone can be trusted with the sword, it is he.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You briefly toy with the idea of revealing that he tried to sell his daughter to you in return for your support.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We would relish the opportunity to travel to Chang&#x2019;an to pay homage to our Emperor, and fully support Master Nie as the custodian of the sword until then,&#x201D; say Zuo Qingfeng. His wife nods, adding her vote to his.<br>
<br>
Looking around, you gauge your chances of pushing for another custodian. No. It will not work&#x2026; you do not have enough support at the moment to get everything your own way. Guo Fu already seems convinced of Nie&#x2019;s respectability in the first place: if you continue to press the issue, he might start unwittingly asking questions that will make you seem petty in front of the others. You would lose all of the gains you have made thus far. Besides, there is nothing saying that the position of custodian cannot be rotated during the trip itself.<br>
<br>
Without hesitation, you nod. &#x201C;Yes, I too feel that Master Nie is the best person to keep the Xuanyuan Sword safe for now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing smiles: he definitely regards this as a feather in his cap. &#x201C;Thank you &#x2013; all of you &#x2013;  for your confidence in me! I am looking forward to this journey with my fellow swordsmen!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, a decision has been made.&#x201D; The hostess speaks up from behind her red veil. She has been playing a light, calming song on her zither all this while; you had not noticed it until now, so intent that you were on trying to outmanoeuvre Nie Wuxing. &#x201C;The Xuanyuan Sword belongs to the Emperor, and as a gesture of loyalty and tribute, the wielders present will escort the sword to the Court.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, that is our decision,&#x201D; says Nie Wuxing, confidently taking command of the situation before you can.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see.&#x201D; The delicate fingers stop strumming the strings, and the music comes to a halt. You almost fancy that you can see a smile behind that veil. The hostess looks up and past all of you, towards the audience. &#x201C;Are you alright with that decision, my lord?&#x201D; she calls out gently.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;When did you find out?&#x201D; Shun replies without any hint of fear &#x2013; in fact, he almost seems amused.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did you really think <i>you</i>, of all people, could take a single step on <i>my </i>island and I would still remain blind to your presence? It only amused me to allow you to run around like a lost little puppy. Were you already thinking about what you would do after this, after you had departed the island? How does it feel to have that hope smashed at the last minute?&#x201D; She giggles enchantingly, placing one hand behind her veil.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-what is the meaning of this? What is going on?&#x201D; shouts Nie Wuxing. Madam Nie is frowning deeply &#x2013; this is the first time that you have seen her shaken &#x2013; and she turns to Bai Jiutian to whisper something. Shun&#x2019;s gaze is fixed on the woman, muttering something under his breath. Gao Ying is already rising from his seat, nodding at you.<br>
<br>
You feel as if the woman is smiling directly at you from under her veil.<br>
<br>
A thought flashes across your mind.<br>
<br>
Shun is in danger.<br>
<br>
You have to act.<br>
<br>
At the same time Gao Ying lets fly a barrage of needles, you grab the Yuchang Sword and lunge at the veiled woman. &#x201C;The loyal dogs are <i>so </i>quick to act,&#x201D; she says mockingly. Raising her hand, she plucks at the zither. The resulting note is at once &#x2013; <i>somehow</i> &#x2013; both harmonious and discordant&#x2026; and powerful enough to blast you backwards through the air before you can reach her, along with Gao Ying&#x2019;s needles. Laughing, she begins playing the zither at a frenetic pace, her fingers blurring over the strings. As the zither&#x2019;s melody echoes loudly around the hall, everyone present begins staggering about, clutching at their heads. Your own is spinning painfully &#x2013; that single strong note from earlier still echoes about inside your skull.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, you see Shun leaping over you, heading for the veiled woman. He seems unaffected by the music, a grim smile on his face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Foolish child.&#x201D; The tune rises to a triumphant crescendo, and there is a flash of blinding light. When your vision returns, both Shun and the lady are no longer there. A fluttering red cloth &#x2013; similar to the clothes worn by the veiled woman &#x2013; catches your eye as it vanishes into a dark corridor. You are certain that it was not present in the hall before.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll secure the sword! Then, we go after that woman and rescue the boy!&#x201D; shouts Nie Wuxing, grabbing the Xuanyuan Sword from the dais. The old bastard has recovered the quickest out of everyone present &#x2013; you are still flat on your back, struggling from the effects of the song. You have heard of music techniques, and Master Zhang himself knows of a couple, but this is the first time you have encountered it in action. Well, you won&apos;t repeat that mistake again. Holding back a wave of vomit, you manage to crawl to your knees&#x2026; that is all you can manage to do for now. Your strength hasn&#x2019;t fully returned.<br>
<br>
After a short while, a large hand grabs your collar, hauling you to your feet. Turning around, you nod at Guo Fu in appreciation. You are still unsteady, however, and stumble. Lingshu is there before you hit the ground, lending you her shoulder. As Qilin, Yunzi and Armaiti run towards you in concern, you look towards the new passageway. Most of the orthodox members have already vanished. Gao Ying and Xiaofang too are gone &#x2013; they must have plunged into the corridor as soon as they could. &#x201C;We must hurry,&#x201D; urges Lingshu.<br>
<br>
There is no time to waste.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As your group proceeds down the passage, you spot Liu Qi and Su Liaojing far in front of you where the corridor splits in two opposite directions. &#x201C;Master! Master Liu! Master Nie! They went <i>this </i>way!&#x201D; shouts Liu Qi, waving in the air, as he looks down the left path.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Forget it, Qi,&#x201D; says Su Liaojing calmly, resting his long staff over his shoulder. &#x201C;There is no point relying on them. We can do this ourselves. Let&#x2019;s hurry. If I am not mistaken, that young man is&#x2026;&#x201D; Patting his friend on the back, Su rushes down the right passage. Sighing in exasperation, Liu Qi follows, the both of them disappearing before you can catch up.<br>
<br>
It looks like the path has split here.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nie must have went off on his own with the Xuanyuan Sword,&#x201D; says Qilin quickly. &#x201C;His Majesty and the woman should be in the passage on the right. I&#x2019;ll go and trail him, to make sure he doesn&#x2019;t do anything funny with the sword. Jing, you can go after the Emperor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll go with you,&#x201D; says Yunzi. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not safe to go alone.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin looks surprised at her offer, but nods. &#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m&#x2026; I&#x2019;m going down the right path&#x2026;&#x201D; pants Xuezi, having run desperately to keep up with you. &#x201C;That woman is too strange!&#x201D; She might be understating it a little bit.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You go after Shun.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You go after Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You decide quickly who else should go where.<br>
<br>
Song Lingshu should:<br>
<b>A. </b>Go after Shun.<br>
<b>B. </b>Go after Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
Armaiti should:<br>
<b>A. </b>Go after Shun.<br>
<b>B. </b>Go after Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
Murong Yandi should:<br>
<b>A. </b>Go after Shun.<br>
<b>B. </b>Go after Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
Guo Fu should:<br>
<b>A. </b>Go after Shun.<br>
<b>B. </b>Go after Nie Wuxing.

            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Ten Swords Conference V</span></b><br>
<br>
The shadows stir.<br>
<br>
You shift your footing mid-run, narrowly dodging a black blade aimed for your ribs. Spinning around, you smash your left foot into the side of the figure that has just attempted to ambush you. To your surprise, it manages to stop your attack, blocking your kick with its arms. At the same time, it vanishes with a dark little puff, dissipating into the air.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Everyone, watch out!&#x201D; shouts Song Lingshu.<br>
<br>
More and more of these strange shadowy figures appear, seemingly oozing from the floor and the walls. Are they some sort of servants bound to the veiled lady? They are certainly not human &#x2013; even moreso than ghosts, they seem to consist purely of <i>yin </i>energy. Regardless, getting tied down here would be a huge mistake. You should not waste your time with these things. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t engage them! We just need to make it through!&#x201D; Directing them to run for it, you grab Xuezi and begin sprinting down the corridor. The shadows are not extremely agile &#x2013; it is a simple matter to evade them. Their numbers, however, are a different problem altogether. Dodging the outstretched hands and assorted weaponry, you zig-zag your way past the gauntlet.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Watch it, you fool!&#x201D; shouts Xuezi, as a pike nearly catches her hair. &#x201C;That was close!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No harm done! Just cling on tighter!&#x201D; Darting to the side, you make a sweeping strike behind you with your palm. The power of the Divine Dragon Sweeps Its Tail blows back a good dozen of the shadows, evaporating them. It also causes the wooden beams set into the walls to creak. You hope that the cracking is just a figment of your imagination. Feeling slightly uneasy at the structural integrity of this mansion, you hurry on. As you turn another corner, a series of bright flashes cause you to squint.<br>
<br>
Ahead of you are Liu Qi and Su Liaojing, the two orthodox pugilists standing back-to-back in a large room. A horde of shadows, almost indistinguishable from one another, has surrounded them. Su lets a bunch of empty satchels drop from his hand. &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t seem to work that well. Back to the usual methods, I suppose,&#x201D; he says in resignation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, brother! I have your back!&#x201D; shouts Liu Qi, raising the Tai&#x2019;e Sword high into the air. For a moment the shadows appear to freeze, cowering before the magnificent blade. Without hesitation, they begin attacking, exchanging blows with the throng of dark figures. You leap into the fray, dispatching two shadows with your powerful claws. Some of them even appear to be armoured, and as for others, you have a strange sense of familiarity; as if you have fought them somewhere before. The rest of your group follows, joining the battle as soon as they can.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Man Tiger Pig!&#x201D; Liu Qi is surprised by your sudden arrival, gawking even as he disarms a shadow and rams his blade into its chest. &#x201C;Why are you-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No time for words right now. Where&#x2019;s the woman?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There,&#x201D; says Su Liaojing, one finger pointing upwards. A wooden stairway runs along the walls, spiralling upwards. &#x201C;The&#x2026; noble young man was chasing after her, along with his companions.&#x201D; He swats away a row of shadows with his staff. &#x201C;We were about to follow, but these things cut us off.&#x201D; You can see what he means: although they are not extremely skilled, the shadow fighters have the overwhelming weight of superior numbers behind them. It would be too risky to use <i>qinggong </i>and break past with just two people, but now that you have brought reinforcements, that is no longer impossible. Still tricky, however. The battle appears to be never-ending no matter what methods you attempt.<br>
<br>
Looking at the architecture of the room, you decide that it is impossible to temporarily clear the room with a good roar; chances are good that you would just collapse the place on top of your head. If so&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will do something about this,&#x201D; rumbles Guo Fu. &#x201C;Please make a break for it when you have the chance.&#x201D; He swings the Qixing Longyuan Sword above his head before bringing it down, drawing a circle about himself. His move seem to attract the shadows, drawing their hostile intent towards him like water circling down a hole &#x2013; is it another Taiji technique? Calmly, his eyes full of purpose, Guo Fu parries the closest shadow expertly. This starts a chain reaction where they topple swiftly one by one, each shadow knocking down the one next to it. &#x201C;Now!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Hugging Xuezi close to you, you take Lingshu&#x2019;s hand and leap before the shadows can recover. Even so you have to contend with thrown spears, each narrowly missing you by a hair. Bouncing off the railings of the stairs, you hop to the top. Beneath you, however, it looks like Guo Fu and the others have been surrounded by the shadows again. Liu Qi and Su Liaojing fall into step with Guo Fu immediately, guarding his back in perfect harmony. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll take care of things here!&#x201D; calls out Liu Qi. Nodding, you shout your thanks and head for the doorway at the top of the stairs; you are almost there.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;More ants.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The moment you leap through the door, a strong gust of wind batters you, almost blowing you back into the building. You drop down to avoid that fate, clawing the grass in a desperate effort. Xuezi lets out muffled moans of protest as you cover her with your body. Lingshu grips your hand tightly, steadying herself while she plunges the Chixiao Sword into the ground for a better hold.<br>
<br>
You appear to have reached the top of the cliffs; the highest point of the island. Rows of multicoloured banners flutter, tossed about by the strong gale. At the end of a brick path lies a large stone altar. A long object lies upon it, wrapped in a strip of dirty yellow cloth. There is a forest of incense in front of the altar. You can hear the light tinkling of bells, floating through the air.<br>
<br>
This place is a shrine.<br>
<br>
Shun stands before the altar, facing the veiled lady. He casts you a quick glance and gestures briefly with his fingers. <i>Do not worry</i>.<br>
<br>
Even as his clothes are whipped about by the wind, his expression remains unchanged. Xiaofang is down on the ground, but Gao Ying is nowhere to be seen. The veiled lady giggles. &#x201C;So, what will you do now, little Emperor? Did you not come here for this?&#x201D; Picking up the wrapped object from the altar daintily, she allows the wrappings to blow away in the wind. The yellow cloth flies into the air, its colour striking a stark contrast against the dark, cloudy sky. In no time at all it is carried out by the air currents towards the sea. What she holds in her hands is a sword: a copper sword that is rather nondescript except for inscriptions that run all along the blade.<br>
<br>
Intense, inexplicable feelings of hatred and sorrow swarm your mind all at the same time when you see that blade. <i>Betrayal</i>, whispers the deepest, darkest part of your soul. And as the feelings fade, vanishing as quickly and as mysteriously as they have appeared, you somehow <i>know </i>that the sword in her hand is the real Xuanyuan Sword. You open your mouth to shout, but your words are blown away by the wind. Your fingers dig in deeper into the ground. Your mind begins furiously considering the things you can do right now.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your predecessor was a fool but rather thorough in his defenses. I predicted you would leave the safety of the capital with such a lure, but to be honest, I did not expect you would come prepared.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My father left behind some interesting writings in his laboratory,&#x201D; smiles Shun calmly. &#x201C;I do not seem to have prepared <i>enough</i>, though.&#x201D; Somehow, their voices carry through the air softly, even through the powerful winds.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, you have not,&#x201D; agrees the lady. &#x201C;You are but a child. Did you think you could stave off the natural cycle of the world forever? All dynasties rise, have their day under the auspices of Heaven, and eventually all must fall. Such is the way of the world... a reminder that only the rule of Heaven is eternal, not man. The Tang have long, <i>long </i>overstayed their allotted time to rule. The Will of Heaven must be followed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;At the cost of the people suffering in the time it takes for a new dynasty to arise and impose order? I am not so callous that I will stand aside and watch as that happens. You can do your best with your famines and plagues, and let us see whether the capricious whims of the gods can suppress the ingenuity of man,&#x201D; laughs Shun lightly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, that is a problem, is it not?&#x201D; The lady cocks her head to one side. &#x201C;You have been a particularly tenacious one. All was set up to <i>finally</i> fall into ruins at the moment of your father&#x2019;s death, but you wrested control of the empire from the wheels of fate. Still, we would have been content to allow the Tang to die a slow, shameful death at the hands of your descendants &#x2013; any respite you can earn in your short lifetime is only temporary &#x2013; but you <i>just</i> had to blaspheme against the gods by that little act in which your servants pretended to their hallowed names, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; She laughs mockingly. &#x201C;When we saw that terrible show, we decided to speed up things just a little as a reward for your hubris. And now here you are.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You dragged me <i>all </i>the way up here just so you could explain your little plan? You immortals must be really bored.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can think what you want, but in truth&#x2026; Yes. We are, actually.&#x201D; She raises the Xuanyuan Sword, resting its point under Shun&#x2019;s throat.<br>
<br>
The wind grows stronger &#x2013; you are forced to keep your head down, unable to even raise it. There must be something you can do.<br>
<br>
There is a light cough underneath you. Looking down, you see blood trickling from Xuezi&#x2019;s mouth.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is bad. I exerted myself too much to fight off the zither&#x2019;s melody,&#x201D; she gasps. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t unlock my seals by myself. I need some help&#x2026; I need your chaotic <i>qi</i>. Quickly!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You give her your <i>qi</i>. You can&#x2019;t see any other way out of this predicament other than for Xuezi to unlock her seals and buy you some time to retrieve Shun.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You cannot give her your <i>qi</i>; it will be severely harmful to her body if used to forcefully unblock her power. You&#x2019;ll find another way out of this. You can do this.

					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Ten Swords Conference VI</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I think not. It&#x2019;s too risky.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Xuezi begins cursing up a storm of protests, but you ignore her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I thought interfering directly with mortal affairs was forbidden by a long-standing edict of Heaven,&#x201D; says Shun loudly. This seems to give the veiled woman pause.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Be a good girl now. Lingshu, catch.&#x201D; Letting go of Song Lingshu&#x2019;s hand, you pass Xuezi over. With one arm freed up, you throw a loop of silk around Lingshu&#x2019;s Chixiao Sword. The red string wraps around the sword&#x2019;s hilt tightly, forming a secure knot in an instant.<br>
<br>
The veiled woman begins replying to Shun. &#x201C;I see you know that much, at least. Unfortunately for you, foolish Emperor, there are exceptions. Let&#x2019;s say, if they intrude into our domain&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean, this island&#x2026;&#x201D; Shun seems surprised.<br>
<br>
You make your apologize to Lingshu in advance. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to need that sword for a bit. Sorry.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you-&#x201C; Before Lingshu can finish her words, you give her a sharp kick. Her grip on the sword loosens as she flies backwards, clutching Xuezi in her arms. At the same time, you use the force of the kick to propel yourself forward, your fingers pushing into the ground to gain traction. Charging against the strong wind, even with your <i>qinggong</i>, you make little headway before you are blown back again. As you tumble through the air, you feel the silk running through your fingers. Using it as a guide, you manage to fall back towards the sword. Your feet land against the hilt. The crimson blade bends slightly, but does not break or come loose from the ground: as expected, the quality of a legendary sword is truly something to be admired. With a shout, you launch yourself into the wind again, kicking off the Chixiao Sword with all of your strength.<br>
<br>
You get further this time, but it is still not enough. You are still falling short. You reach out &#x2013; your hand will not get there in time. The veiled lady is about to strike. Winding the silk around your fingers, you tug, hard. You swing your arm forwards desperately. Tied to you through the silk, the Chixiao Sword turns into a whirling red circle as it spins rapidly, cutting through the wind with ease.<br>
<br>
You could only hope that in your desperation, you timed it right. Aimed it right.<br>
<br>
There is a clang of metal. The Chixiao Sword bounces off the Xuanyuan Sword, knocking it off course.<br>
<br>
Instead of piercing Shun&#x2019;s throat, the copper blade sinks into his abdomen.<br>
<br>
Blood, red blood, trickles down the sword, running through the grooves that make up the ancient inscriptions.<br>
<br>
The woman turns, throwing a furious glare at you. This time the wind feels like a battering ram, taking all breath out of your lungs. It knocks you up into the sky, smashing you through the tall banners. As you fall through the air, the ground below you shudders. A loud, muffled groan of stone giving way seems to spread throughout the island, resonating from every plot of ground. The small tower you had emerged from collapses, crumbling in on itself. There is a tremendous bang as the stone altar splits down the middle, toppling the pot of incense. The veiled woman cries out. You hit the ground hard, but spring to your feet immediately. The wind has weakened; no longer being directed by her will, it now swirls around the cliffs wildly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What did you do, Li Shun?&#x201D; she screams angrily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It came a little too late&#x2026; but the disruption was successful. As it so happens, I <i>do </i>know a bit about celestial domains,&#x201D; grins Shun, who is kneeling on the ground just behind her; he has removed the sword from his gut and is attempting to stem the flow of blood with his fingers.<br>
<br>
You shout out his name. If you can just get to him&#x2026;<br>
<br>
The veiled lady lashes out at Shun, her fingers arching into sharp claws. With an agility that belies his injury, he rolls safely out of the way. Her claws sink into the floor; the stone begins melting and bubbling as she withdraws her hand. Shun laughs, staggering to his feet. &#x201C;If you are truly all-knowing, you would have killed me the moment I stepped on this island. Still, it was not an easy task to fool you. If I had no intention of fully putting my own life on the line, I could not have cornered you here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you some sort of idiot? You would have died!&#x201D; you shout, rushing to his side.<br>
<br>
Shun merely shrugs, giving you a good-natured grin. &#x201C;Look who&#x2019;s talking. Anyway, you bailed me out, didn&#x2019;t you? I believed that you would, and it paid off. Of course, I would have had to think up something if you weren&apos;t here...&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Was he always the sort to take such insane gambles? You thought that was <i>your </i>duty. He should not have to bet his own life in <i>anything</i>. He is the <i>Emperor</i> after all. You didn&#x2019;t really bail him out, not with him taking a bloody <i>sword wound</i>. <i>What is he even thinking</i>?<br>
<br>
Despite all of your confusion and disgruntlement, you do not get to challenge him about his decision, as at the next moment he sinks weakly to the ground. You catch him before he falls.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m alright. I just need a few seconds to recuperate,&#x201D; he murmurs, waving away your concern. &#x201C;Victory is already ours.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A soft giggle floats into your ears. &#x201C;Paid off? Victory? Are you all fools? None of you will leave here alive.&#x201D; There is a tremor of anger in the veiled lady&#x2019;s voice that you have not heard before; from her trembling shoulders, she appears to be positively seething. &#x201C;That is a fact.&#x201D; Her voice turns cold as a tremendous flow of <i>yin </i>qi radiates from her body. The shadows darken further even though the sun is hidden behind the clouds. The darkness under her feet ripples; for a moment, you seem to see hundreds of faces, masked in shade, flowing towards her from every direction. Putting her palms up, she takes a stance, that veil still covering her face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I may have to revise my declaration of victory just a bit,&#x201D; mutters Shun. &#x201C;<i>This </i>I did not expect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fall, into the eternal prison where no light will reach you. Neither the gods nor the Buddha will be your salvation,&#x201D; chants the veiled woman &#x2013; soft though her voice is, you hear her as if she is whispering directly into your ear.<br>
<br>
You feel a prickling running all up and down your spine.<br>
<br>
She will kill the both of you if you try to grab Shun and run.<br>
<br>
She will kill Shun if you do not occupy anything less than her full attention.<br>
<br>
She will kill you if you make so much as a single mistake in battle.<br>
<br>
You bare your teeth in a grin, though cold sweat runs down your neck. Just the odds that you like.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You go in swiftly on the offensive and into close combat, relying mainly on your claws and kicks to overwhelm and occupy her attention. Despite her powerful <i>qi</i>, you are confident that at close range you are superior in speed and agility; you just need to batter her down.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You take advantage of her unarmed state and use your swords as your main offensive force. With the Yuchang Sword and your wodao, and the Chixiao Sword lying near the altar still tied with silk, you may be able to overcome her with your techniques; it would take only one good slash to take off her head.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You stay a bit further back and rely on medium-range combat, utilizing the defensive and longer-ranged techniques of the Xianglong Palms to prevent her from coming too close to you. Once you create an opening, you will blast her with the most powerful palm in the series.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You enter an entirely defensive stance, relying on the Taiji Fist and Sword to fend off the veiled woman&#x2019;s techniques. All you need to do is to play safe, hold out and attempt to use your <i>qi</i>-absorption ability to weaken her at the same time.<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You take the Xuanyuan Sword from Shun and attack the veiled woman with it. It is said to be the greatest of the legendary swords, forged of celestial metal. Surely it contains some sort of power that will allow you to turn this situation around.

            <h3>六十四 · Immortal Banishment</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Immortal Banishment</span></b><br>
<br>
You hop from one foot to another, grinning at the woman.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D; she demands, stretching out her palm.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just warming up. I&#x2019;m coming straight at you, so be ready,&#x201D; you declare. Then, you kick off, going straight as her just as you said. You see the veiled lady leap backwards &#x2013; your sudden burst of speed seems to have taken her by surprise this time around &#x2013; before she waves her palms at you. Relying solely on your instincts, you leap into the air, spinning away from a mass of darkness that seem to have erupted from the ground itself. You do not manage a clean dodge; where the shadows brush against your body with their icy touch, a numbing pain spreads.<br>
<br>
Gritting your teeth, you land on your feet. Instantly, she conjures up more streams of dark <i>yin </i>energy that shoot towards you. A couple of stray shots head towards Shun, but to your relief the Xuanyuan Sword seems able to repel them &#x2013; there is a faint golden glow around the blade as Shun weakly holds it in front of him. Turning your thoughts back to battle, you charge forward, dodging between the streams as you zig-zag your way towards her. When you reach her, you lash out with your claws, intercepting her hands in mid-swing before she can complete her subsequent moves. The veiled lady draws back with an shout of annoyance, her arms slipping away from your grasp as she appears to float effortlessly across the ground.<br>
<br>
The shadows ripple.<br>
<br>
Even as she attempts to gesture again, you are upon her, slashing away with your claws. &#x201C;Xuantiedun!&#x201D; shouts out the woman, throwing both hands outwards. Your fingers are stopped short by an invisible wall of <i>qi</i>. The feeling is jarring; as if you have suddenly struck an iron shield. Concentrating your <i>qi </i>in your fingertips, you crush the invisible wall.<br>
<br>
The veiled lady tries to take this chance to distance herself from you again, but you pounce upon her like a beast seeking its prey. Soaring above her head, you execute the Earth Splitting Lightning Descent, bringing your heel down upon her head. Again, your attack is stopped by the <i>qi </i>barrier. The stone floor beneath her feet cracks as the force of your blow is transferred into the ground, but the woman remains unharmed.<br>
<br>
Taking advantage of the recoil, you leap towards one of the pillars surrounding the broken altar. You spring off of the pillar, using it as a platform to launch yourself towards her yet again. The veiled lady&#x2019;s hands blur, raised in a defensive position. No problem. You will just crush it again.<br>
<br>
However, the barrier you are expecting does not materialize. Instead, she drives her open palm directly at you. Just in the nick of time, you twist your body in mid-air. Somehow, you instinctively know what to do. You use The Abyssal Dragon Plummets, pushing aside her wrist with your own even as you fall. You can feel the rush of wind against your cheek and &#x2013; shortly after &#x2013; the sound of stone crumbling behind you. If that had hit&#x2026;<br>
<br>
As soon as you land, the veiled lady takes the offensive; she swoops down with her own claws &#x2013; attacks powerful enough to melt stone. If you get hit even once, it is going to hurt you plenty. Pulling off a series of nimble evasions with ease, you attempt to retaliate, but she has gained enough breathing room to make use of her shadows again.<br>
<br>
A gigantic black wave of powerful <i>yin qi</i> rises over you; you realize that if you let it engulf you, you are finished. Gathering your own <i>qi </i>in your fingertips, you sharpen your claws and let fly. The concentrated chaos disperses the darkness in front of you, drilling through the wave as you break through and charge straight for the veiled woman.<br>
<br>
This does not seem to faze her. She lets out a mocking laugh, drawing her hands towards her. Behind you, the shadows reform and shoot straight for your back. You manage to turn at the last second, slashing apart the gathered shadows. Knowing that the woman will not miss this opportunity to strike, you complete your spin, whirling around to face her.<br>
<br>
The only thing you can do in time is to harden your guard.<br>
<br>
Her palm touches the middle of your crossed forearms gently. At the moment of contact, you feel an extremely destructive force tearing and smashing its way through your body. The bones of your arms creak &#x2013; perhaps even crack &#x2013; as you take one staggering step backwards. Blood wells up in your mouth and you almost gag; that blow has definitely caused you some internal injuries.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll take care of you first,&#x201D; she murmurs gleefully, preparing to introduce her bone-melting claws to your skull.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have little experience fighting, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; you smile, your lips stained red as you spit out the blood in your mouth. Her techniques are the only thing that are powerful &#x2013; as for the immortal herself, she has no sense of personal danger. She is the sort to be utterly blinded by the sight of victory.<br>
<br>
From your crossed guard position, you throw your arms outwards, using the Elusive Claws of the Hidden Tiger to deceive her. She has thrown everything she has into her attack, and you throw everything you have into your counter-attack at the last possible second. You unleash the Raging Claws of the Mad Lion at point-blank with all your strength; the force of your attack rushes outward, tearing up the ground all around her and making deep claw marks in the remaining pillars. Those promptly topple a second later.<br>
<br>
The veiled lady screams, falling back in a panic. &#x201C;It hurts! It hurts!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It takes a split second before you realize that something is wrong.<br>
<br>
She is still entirely unharmed. Even her clothes are unscathed. You are mistaken &#x2013; she does not <i>need</i> a sense of personal danger. Not when facing you. All of her lack of skill and over-reliance on her powerful techniques &#x2013; disadvantages you thought you could capitalize on &#x2013; are meaningless weak points compared to the advantage of being <i>invincible</i>. The veiled lady begins laughing. &#x201C;How was my acting? Did you really think a mortal like you could ever threaten me? Oh, don&#x2019;t be so stunned that you forget your place, you useless insect.&#x201D; She points a finger at you.<br>
<br>
Appearing faster than you can react, black spikes shoot up from the ground, piercing your right arm. The shadows begin to spread quickly, swallowing your arm greedily.<br>
<br>
You howl in agony as you feel your flesh dying, taken by the darkness.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will take you apart, piece by piece,&#x201D; promises the immortal happily. &#x201C;Your very existence is an insult to Heaven. But first, perhaps I will use the Xiansha Finger to make you kill your own master.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Stepping towards you in a light-hearted manner, she jabs her finger into your pressure points.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is a good thing that you don&#x2019;t have any to work with.<br>
<br>
A soft murmur of surprise comes from behind the veil.<br>
<br>
She takes a step backwards.<br>
<br>
Screaming, you tear yourself free from the shadows&#x2019; vise-like grip to wet, ripping sounds that echo in your ear.<br>
<br>
She attempts to strike at you with her claws, but finally you have the advantage of surprise. Her movements are slow. Hesitant. She is too confused to fight effectively. Even with one arm, you knock away her attacks; you draw in close, too close for her to use her accursed shadows.<br>
<br>
You raise your arm to strike. Even if it is useless, the more time you spend fighting, the more time Shun has to recover and retreat.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Get down!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You hear Shun&#x2019;s order, and obey. Dropping down, you feel his feet step onto your back. Shun vaults over you, shouting. Using you as a platform to get above the veiled lady, he lands behind her. She turns. Still shaken by your relentless one-armed assault, she does so just a bit too slow.<br>
<br>
When you raise your head, the blade of the Xuanyuan Sword is protruding from her chest. The veiled lady gasps, clutching at the sword. &quot;How is it possible for you to use... that sword... to...&quot;<br>
<br>
Her confusion does not last. &#x201C;C-cursed Tang Emperor!&#x201D; she spits, regaining her composure. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t think you have won! I am taking you with me!&#x201D; shrieks the woman, her voice full of rage and fire. Shouting, she raises her arm and gestures, summoning a shadowy torrent of <i>yin </i>energy to strike Shun down with her last breath.<br>
<br>
Shun&apos;s expression remains steady. He furrows his brow, concentrating, and mimics her gestures swiftly.<br>
<br>
Shadows meet, clash, and dissipate harmlessly.<br>
<br>
The veiled lady screams a furious curse to the heavens as she begins to glow.<br>
<br>
There is a flash of golden light, and then all that is left are her clothes.<br>
<br>
The storm clouds in the sky are blown away by the flow of the wind. The sun begins shining down upon you again. At the moment, you find the heat almost intolerable.<br>
<br>
You crawl towards Shun, who is slumped on the ground, still clutching the Xuanyuan Sword tightly. It is stained heavily with blood &#x2013; all of it his. The ancient inscriptions now stand out in darkening red. &#x201C;Sorry for being late,&#x201D; he grins weakly, &#x201C;it took me too long to gather enough strength to stand.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No harm done,&#x201D; you shake your head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I wouldn&#x2019;t say that.&#x201D; He gestures at your right arm.<br>
<br>
You have not looked at it since you tore yourself free of the shadows. You turn your head, dreading what you might see - and you regret looking at it almost instantly. Your entire arm is missing below the shoulder. The wound itself is a mess of frost-bitten, mangled flesh; at least there is little bleeding.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t seem to be very affected by the pain,&#x201D; says Shun.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, I&#x2019;m going to feel it afterwards,&#x201D; you groan. Once the adrenaline wears off, you are sure that it is going to hurt a lot. Not only that &#x2013; it is definitely going to affect your martial arts. Still, if Qi Liuwu can survive with no arms, you can probably manage with one. Positive thinking. &#x201C;How about you? Your&#x2026; wound.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think I will make it,&#x201D; he sighs, clutching his stomach. &#x201C;If you can survive <i>that</i>, this little stab shouldn&#x2019;t be a problem.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After giving Shun&apos;s wound whatever treatment you can with only one arm, you look around you. The cliff-top shrine has been reduced to rubble, and the grounds look like an entire army has trampled through them. There is a growing, throbbing pain where your right arm used to be, and you resist the urge to let out a groan of pain in front of Shun. The gods know he would mock you for it. &#x201C;So, what do we do now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is <i>probably</i> time to leave the island, but first&#x2026;&#x201D; Shun glances at the Xuanyuan Sword, and holds it out to you.<br>
<br>
You stare at him wordlessly.<br>
<br>
The Emperor laughs. &#x201C;Go on, take it in your hand. The one you have left. Give it a try.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Just a little tentatively, you close your fingers around the sword&#x2019;s leather-wrapped hilt.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you think?&#x201D; he asks.<br>
<br>
Waving it around a little, you say, &#x201C;It&#x2026; feels just like a normal, old sword. A bit heavier than usual&#x2026; like it&#x2019;s a bit reluctant in my hands, but nothing special.&#x201D; Certainly, it&#x2019;s not showing any special properties like it does with Shun. You wouldn&#x2019;t try to block any crazy shadow energy blasts with it.<br>
<br>
Shun closes his eyes and nods thoughtfully. &#x201C;I see. Well, do you want to borrow it for a while?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You stare at him again. &#x201C;What are you up to?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I just thought it could help you, since you are short an arm and all,&#x201D; he grins. &#x201C;No, actually, I intended this from the start. If you don&#x2019;t want this honour, I&#x2019;ll just keep it and think about another reward for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You take the Xuanyuan Sword. It might be helpful to you in the future, even if it doesn&apos;t seem to do anything right now. It feels unwieldy enough in your hand that you will not be able to fight with it anytime soon, however.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&#x2019;t take the Xuanyuan Sword. It seems to have protective abilities, and as such you think it would be better to leave it with Shun. It is <i>his </i>sword anyway and he will probably need it more than you do.

            <h3>六十五 · Conference Aftermath</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Conference Aftermath</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;This will be&#x2026; troublesome to clean up.&#x201D; Gao Ying makes a quiet appearance, dragging a still unconscious Xiaofang behind him. Turning to you, he casts a penetrating glance over your injuries and Shun&#x2019;s. &#x201C;Your Majesty. Are you satisfied yet?&#x201D; His tone is low, and though from anyone else you would have thought that he was unwisely mocking the Emperor, you get the feeling that Gao Ying is serious.<br>
<br>
Shun laughs. &#x201C;Yes, I am afraid so. We have done what we came here to do, my best friend has gotten crippled on my behalf, and it is time to make sure we do not waste this opportunity.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very well,&#x201D; murmurs the eunuch. &#x201C;Still, I must say this, Your Majesty, even if you take my head for it. You are not behaving wisely. You <i>already </i>knew that this was a trap before any of us did. Before Xiahou Yu even reported his findings&#x2026; before he even came here to scout out the locations for the fire powder. Am I correct? What thoughts lie in your mind, Your Majesty?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
For a moment, it seems as if the grin on Shun&#x2019;s face is frozen while a dark shadow passes under it, like fish swimming beneath the ice. It melts into an easy-going smile in the next instant, and he says, &#x201C;You think too much, Gao Ying. But I&#x2019;ll try and take your advice. I have had enough adventure for a while&#x2026; perhaps it <i>would</i> be better if I returned to the capital and rested for a year or two. Anyway, it worked out well, did it not?&#x201D; He pauses for a while, and then adds, apologetically, &#x201C;Except for your arm, Jing. I&#x2019;m really sorry about that. I&#x2019;ll see what I can do to make up for it once we leave the island.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A loud crack startles you. Gao Ying whirls around, immediately on guard. The rubble that was once the tower you entered from begins moving. A large hand punches its way clear, and Guo Fu&#x2019;s earnest face appears. &#x201C;You are okay!&#x201D; he shouts, but as he runs to you his happy smile inverts itself. &#x201C;Your arm!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Behind him, Lingshu, Xuezi, Su Liaojing and Liu Qi too appear, having managed to climb their way to the top. When she sees your injuries, Lingshu lets out a gasp, while Xuezi seems to be extremely dissatisfied. Su Liaojing immediately goes to his knees upon reaching Shun, looking nowhere but at the ground in front of him. &#x201C;Your Majesty.&#x201D; Liu Qi seems surprised, but hurriedly follows.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, we guess the secret is revealed. You are Su Liaojing of Kunlun, are you not?&#x201D; Shun says, lounging imperiously on a rock despite his wounds.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, Your Majesty.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We must thank you for introducing fire medicine to my engineers. They will make marvels out of it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The credit is not mine, Your Majesty. It is your foresight that encouraged such development,&#x201D; demurs Su.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do refrain from excessive humility. Kunlun will receive its rewards for advancing the nation.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-your Majesty?&#x201D; ventures Liu, who appears to be slightly nervous in the presence of royalty. &#x201C;Please do not be offended by my worthless question, but just why are you here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why indeed,&#x201D; laughs Shun. &#x201C;That much is a secret. The two of you <i>can </i>keep a secret, right?&#x201D; It is no surprise that he wants to keep it so: he would have to be truly insane to proclaim that he is fighting the very heavens that grant him the right to rule. The alternative, that he is battling evil demons personally, is no better &#x2013; coming off his father&#x2019;s reign, that was a move likely to lose the courtiers&#x2019; confidence in him in one bold stroke. Furthermore, if they know that harm has come to his royal body, that was also information that his enemies could exploit.<br>
<br>
Su glances warily at Gao Ying before he replies. &#x201C;Of course. I am ever your humble servant. Your wish is the will of Heaven. This encounter will not be spoken of to anyone, not even my father or my master.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Excellent.&#x201D; Shun nods. &#x201C;We have our own reasons for being here which have entirely nothing to do with the sword conference, and hope that you will understand that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course, Your Majesty!&#x201D; proclaims Liu fervently.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Shun, Gao Ying and Xiaofang leave using a different path: it appears that Xiahou Yu is secretly awaiting them in a boat at the back of the island. You travel back to the pier, where you meet up with Qilin and the rest. Echoing cries of &#x201C;Your arm!&#x201D; fills the air for a few seconds, like birds squawking in a great big flock.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s&#x2026; not so bad. Maybe we can have a fake arm that you can keep a snake in,&#x201D; suggests Qilin cheerfully. &#x201C;Or a great big pocket of flammable powder, so that the whole arm is set on flames, and&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-well, you should have taken better care of yourself. What an idiot,&#x201D; mutters Yunzi, although she sneaks concerned glances at your missing arm once in a while.<br>
<br>
Armaiti just stares at your stump, blushing. You wonder what is up with that.<br>
<br>
The girls begin telling you their story. It looks like they were delayed by the Masters of Kunlun and Taishan: they had recognized Yunzi, and were kicking up a great fuss. Following that, Madam Nie had made a surprising attempt on her own to take Qilin with her. By the time they reached the pier, Nie Wuxing was already preparing to sail off. Boldly citing the danger on the island as the main reason &#x2013; the Emperor&#x2019;s precious sword <i>must </i>be kept safe, after all &#x2013; and that he will await everyone on the mainland to embark on their journey together, he left. Murong Yandi had chased after Nie Wuxing to keep an eye on him, using a single plank as his raft, while the others remained to await your arrival.<br>
<br>
It looks like you would have to hurry back.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When you reach Yangzhou, it is unsurprisingly in the process of rebuilding. According to the townsfolk, tens of thousands of beggars had swarmed the streets with their stink and sticks, battling it out for supremacy. The city guards had been unable to do anything in the face of those numbers, retreating behind the gates of the magistrate to wait out the catastrophe.<br>
<br>
You find Qi Liuwu relaxing by the stairs of the inn. Despite being outnumbered and outmatched, he had managed to eke out a narrow victory through sheer tactical acumen, directing his beggars as if he would an army. His eyes open wide when he sees you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s this, kid? I know that my ability to live life unhindered by any arms is worthy of admiration, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean you should take it as an actual example!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh, waving away his concerns. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t really plan on losing another one if I can help it. Congratulations on your victory. I heard about it on the streets.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would have hoped to finish him off here, but he managed to flee with the bulk of his loyalists. Well, I&#x2019;ll see what we can do about that when my nephew arrives. By the way, I think the little physician is waiting for you inside. Go ahead, she seems to be missing you a lot.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Giving him a quick bow, you move on to your room. Just before you open the door, an indescribable fear suffuses your entire being, warning you not to enter.<br>
<br>
But you have to.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er is still glaring at you from her corner of the room, hugging her knees in silence.<br>
<br>
It looks like you won&#x2019;t be able to coax her out of this foul mood any time soon. It is already late in the evening, and Qilin has whispered to you that tonight is Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s turn. You sigh. Once everyone leaves, you might be in trouble.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am sure you will be fine,&#x201D; chuckles Shangguan Chuji. The Sword Saint had come to pay a visit; he looks the same as ever. You are not sure if he was ever ill, but according to Cao&#x2019;er, he had been hiding his terminal disease so as to keep Murong Yandi from worrying &#x2013; when she came to him, he was perhaps a day away from passing the point of no return. He puts down his cup of tea and glances at the space where your limb had been. What he says next shocks you enough that you almost drop the cup.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Take my arm.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You stare at him. &#x201C;Pardon?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master!&#x201D; shouts Murong Yandi. &#x201C;What are you talking about?&#x201D; He had accompanied his master here, after ascertaining that Nie Wuxing was truly waiting for everyone to be ready before he made his trip to Chang&#x2019;an.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, he is short one arm. He can have mine. I do not use it for much anyway,&#x201D; says the Sword Saint calmly. &#x201C;I am sure Yao Shunshi&#x2019;s successor will be able to patch it together.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;yes, would need a powerful arm for Jing&#x2026; fresh arm. Useless, common meat&#x2026; is no good&#x2026; would just rot&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Cao&#x2019;er from her little corner. &#x201C;That&#x2026; could work.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There you have it,&#x201D; he smiles. &#x201C;The authority has spoken.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The girl saved me from certain death,&#x201D; interrupts Shangguan Chuji. &#x201C;She has taken no payment for it. Why, is my arm not good enough for you? I assure you, it is a fine arm. Rarely used in anger or housework, it is a skilled limb that will aid you plenty in the days to come.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Master,&#x201D; protests Murong Yandi again, &#x201C;this is crazy!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is it, really?&#x201D; he laughs. &#x201C;Our school aims for the pinnacle of having a sword without a sword. What can be more interesting than a swordsman without an arm to swing his sword with? Of course, with that said, I am not too keen to end up like Master Qi. It would trouble me to have to eat with my feet.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Sighing, his disciple gives in.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But&#x2026;&#x201D; Strangely, it is Armaiti who speaks. She appears to be rather disappointed for some reason. The rest of her sentence is mumbled, unintelligible gibberish as her eyes dart towards your missing limb.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did you just say, &#x2018;he looks better like this&#x2019;?&#x201D; exclaims Yunzi suddenly, her eyes wide with surprise. Standing besides Armaiti, she must have heard it more clearly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Holy Maiden, I did not!&#x201D; Aghast, Armaiti denies everything and flees from the room.<br>
<br>
You shake your head and look away from the table. Would that your master was here &#x2013; you think he would have been able to give you good advice. After finding out that Shangguan Chuji <i>was</i> actually sick, he had been accosted by parts of Chief You&#x2019;s beggar army, putting him in a foul mood and them in the afterlife. Master Zhang had then wandered off. You do not know when he will appear before you again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Jing&#x2026;&#x201D; whispers Cao&#x2019;er as she creeps up on you. &#x201C;Let me fix it...&#x201D;<br>
<br>

The next day, you meet up with Shun again. He tosses you a rolled-up scroll. Opening up the scroll you obtained from Shun, you realize that it is an annotated copy of the Wuxiang Qiankun text that you taught to him, written in Shun&apos;s own hand. He seems to have made some suggestions and improvements to the text...<br>
<br>
You close the scroll. You will peruse it later.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have received news from Chief Jiang back in Chang&#x2019;an. The trap was successfully sprung,&#x201D; It looks like his departure from the capital was also meant to lull his enemies into a sense of false security. During the Emperor&#x2019;s absence, Chief Jiang had faked pushing his luck one step too far, causing those in the court who bore a grudge against the constables to attempt to eliminate them while the Son of Heaven was away. They would just spin a story to tell the Emperor when he returned, or so they thought. The constables had been ready for them, and together with an edict that Shun had left behind in preparation, managed to scoop up a large haul of conspirators.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Some lowly members of the Zhang clan were targeted in the operation, and we managed to obtain pretext to search their mansion,&#x201D; reports Gao Ying. The plan was to rescue Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai&#x2019;s twins, and in the process place the blame for kidnapping directly on the Zhangs, but it looks like they had pre-empted that move by just a hair. According to the constables&#x2019; sources, the children had been moved to Xiangyang by the Black Dragon Society.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Zhang clan has had their political power-base reduced,&#x201D; says Shun thoughtfully, &#x201C;but they are not yet destroyed. This will make them desperate. Perhaps desperate enough to use force. I will return to the capital as planned. If I stay away any longer, they might try to use whatever excuse they can get to storm the palace.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As you say, Your Majesty,&#x201D; nods Gao Ying.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As it turns out, my good beggar friend is <i>also </i>headed towards Xiangyang,&#x201D; says Qi Liuwu. &quot;I will finish things there.&quot;<br>
<br>
And it also appears that Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s journey will take him towards that city, on his way to Chang&#x2019;an.<br>
<br>
It looks like you have your next destination.<br>
<br>

After the meeting, you receive a letter from the Fire Temple. It looks like they have things well under control. The Amesha Spenta are offering to assist you, though not all of them are able to leave. Judging from the distance, they would be able to meet up with you at Xiangyang. Vahista has volunteered to stay behind, running the temple&apos;s daily affairs which he is well suited to. To help him out, it would be best if you did not pick more than two of them to come, if you wanted them to at all.<br>

The night before you leave Yangzhou, Qilin comes to your side. You have an idea as to why. &#x201C;Is it about what you wanted to tell me before?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She nods. Strangely enough, she seems a bit shy tonight. Taking a deep breath, she tells you what she wants to say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Can you train me for the Huashan Summit? I mean, <i>really </i>train me. I don&#x2019;t want to be left behind you and Yunzi anymore, especially after what happened on Taoying Island. I mean, if I was stronger, maybe you would not have lost your arm. Besides, if I don&apos;t show what I&apos;m capable of, I can&apos;t exactly be a worthy wife, can I?&#x201D; She laughs awkwardly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not too well versed with Wudu techniques,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure what help I can be.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not the techniques I need help with, I have those memorized already. It&#x2019;s for the basics of battle, developing the instincts of combat,&#x201D; she explains. &#x201C;I will try my best on my own, but if you could help me out, it would be of great help. B-but if you don&#x2019;t, I understand. I could always go to the others for help, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You know that spending your time training her extensively will not yield your own martial arts as much benefit compared to rigorously focusing on your own training, and even as she speaks, Qilin looks away, feeling guilty for suggesting such a thing.<br>
<br>
You wonder what you should do&#x2026;<br>
<br>

            <h3>六十六 · Riverside Rest</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Riverside Rest</span></b><br>
<br>
When you arrive at the meeting spot the next morning, just outside the gates of Yangzhou, Nie Wuxing eyes your entourage warily, a frown creasing his brow. He seems to be looking at Yunzi. &#x201C;So, Xu Jing&#x2026; you are travelling with the Holy Maiden of the Fire Cult?&#x201D; he asks, rather authoritatively. In front of all of his followers he probably feels that it is required of him to have his usual airs of being the leader of the orthodox sects.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is extremely disreputable, even for you,&#x201D; chimes in Liu Ye, the leader of Kunlun Sect. His friend, Su Cheng, agrees quickly. &#x201C;Why would you bring a murderous foreign witch along with you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yunzi&#x2019;s face turns red in anger, preparing to retaliate with a word or two, or even perhaps a choice attack to their faces, but you wave one finger quickly in warning, causing Armaiti to hold her back. She whispers in her Holy Maiden&#x2019;s ear, attempting to get the furious girl to calm down. &#x201C;Many things have happened in the past few years. As it so happens, I have heard that the Fire Temple is no longer as belligerent as it once was, and I thought this was a good way to allow them to understand how peaceful the land is under the protection of the Eight Sects,&#x201D; you explain.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that so? Are you not merely bewitched by that foul slattern?&#x201D; gestures Su Cheng angrily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your mother is a slattern!&#x201D; spits Yunzi vulgarly in response, and you sigh. Su Cheng takes a step forth, apparently so offended that he is willing to come to blows over it. When he realizes that no one else has come forward, however, that single step appears to be all he is willing to take.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is quite enough, my friends,&#x201D; interrupts Nie Wuxing. &#x201C;As orthodox pugilists we must demonstrate restraint and mercy. Just be careful around the Holy Maiden so that we can keep the imperial treasure safe, and I think all else will be fine. Xu Jing, you will ensure your group does not come into conflict with my people, will you not?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you did not want any conflict in the first place, you should have shut your stinky mouth and not asked about the Holy Maiden&#x2019;s presence,&#x201D; says Xuezi loudly. She has been in a rather bad mood ever since returning from Taoying Island.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; what?&#x201D; Nie Wuxing steps back, stroking his beard in alarm at the child&#x2019;s outspokenness. He seems to be at a loss about how to respond; should he lecture her for her foul mouth, or treat her like a gentle, caring uncle?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps we should be moving on,&#x201D; says the Sword Saint calmly, appearing behind the orthodox contingent with his disciple.<br>
<br>
A wave of murmurs spread throughout the pugilists as they turn to salute him and notice his missing arm. Su Liaojing gives you &#x2013; or rather, your arm &#x2013; an impassive glance.<br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing seems rather taken aback at Shangguan Chuji&#x2019;s arrival. &#x201C;Chuji <i>shidi</i>, I&#x2026; did not expect to see you here. And&#x2026; your arm&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I had a terrible accident, which is the real reason why I had to miss the Conference,&#x201D; lies the Sword Saint with a straight face. &#x201C;I am very much in favour of Xu Jing&#x2019;s idea that we present the Xuanyuan Sword to the Emperor, however. Will you allow me to accompany you on this journey, Nie <i>shixiong</i>?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing&#x2019;s idea&#x2026; yes,&#x201D; mutters Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can see no reason why not, dear Shangguan,&#x201D; smiles his wife, who has remained quiet thus far. &#x201C;We have not travelled together for many years.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Thank you,&#x201D; bows the Sword Saint politely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;By the way,&#x201D; continues Madam Nie, &#x201C;Minyue? Where are you? Your master is here. Come, it is rude to hide. Shuixian, where is she?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
One of the Huashan twins coaxes an unwilling Zhang Minyue out in front of the Sword Saint. &#x201C;H-h-hello again, Master Shangguan. How have you been?&#x201D; she stutters, not willing to meet his eyes.<br>
<br>
He stares at her blankly for a while, before the light of recognition flashes in his eyes. &#x201C;Oh, right. You. Thank you, my good disciple. I have been well.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As the purported master and student begin an awkward conversation for the benefit of those around them, you unconsciously twitch the right arm that he has so kindly bestowed upon you. Cao&#x2019;er&#x2019;s technique was sublime &#x2013; though you had to painfully remove what was left of your own arm, it seemed to be a divine miracle that you could even move this donated arm. The process of fully joining the arm was excruciating, and even now it did not feel anywhere near as comfortable as your old one&#x2026; still, she had assured you that it would improve quickly with time. For now, you still had problems channelling your <i>qi </i>through your new right arm.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The trip to present the Xuanyuan Sword began without any further issues. Even though the journey was ostensibly to be conducted together, the orthodox pugilists seemed to keep their distance from you. Liu Qi and Su Liaojing have stayed with the group, along with their masters, but the rest of the younger pugilists have departed for their respective mountains. Bai Jiutian has kept a quiet distance from you, seemingly deep in thought, while the Twin Flowers constantly stare at you with a mixture of suspicion and irritation.<br>
<br>
Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai had left a note saying that they had been informed of their children&#x2019;s new location by an Imperial agent, and rushed ahead by themselves. They had thanked you for your intercession with the Emperor, and hoped that they would meet you again on better terms in the very near future.<br>
<br>
Qi Liuwu and Jiu Mou, keeping a low profile after their victory over Chief You, are also travelling separately to Xiangyang with a small group of their most loyal beggars. It looks like they plan a decisive strike to end this beggar civil war.<br>
<br>
Of Master Zhang there was no news, but you have an uneasy feeling that he might choose to appear at the worst possible time.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, you reach your first stop, barely a day away, at the riverbank. Storm clouds are gathering above your head, and the water level of the river has risen to a risky mark. It looks like you can only start travelling along the river, towards Xiangyang, tomorrow; the boatmen are refusing to go anywhere at the moment. While awaiting the boats, you would have the opportunity to rest at a riverside shelter built specifically for travellers.<br>
<br>
It is not a very comforting shelter &#x2013; even if spacious, the building is nothing more than four walls and a roof. As the rain begins to fall over your head, spattering against the tiles, you wonder if you should take the opportunity to chat with someone. It might also be a good time for you to consider your future training; though most of your time will be taken up with teaching Qilin, you think you can still squeeze in some light practice here and there.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Your practice will focus on:<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>The new arm you have, attempting to get back into shape quickly and to see if you can derive any new insights from its presence.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Further developing the Wuxiang Qiankun Skill, delving further into its mysteries and potential.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You approach someone to talk to (pick three):<br>
<br>
<b>I. </b>Chi Qilin<br>
<b>II. </b>Cao&#x2019;er<br>
<b>III. </b>Yifang<br>

            <h3>六十七 · Riverine Fugitive</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Riverine Fugitive</span></b><br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er is sitting by herself, having found a dry corner where she could unpack her books. Her nose is buried in yet another tome, her eyes rapidly taking in the contents. She is so lost in her own little world that she only notices you when you sit down beside her. Clapping the book shut a little too quickly, she stares at you from behind her long bangs. &#x201C;&#x2026;yes, Jing?&#x201D; Her face appears to be flushed.<br>
<br>
You need to get around to giving her a haircut again, you think. Perhaps after you board the boat. &#x201C;Nothing much. Is your book really that interesting?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She nods.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Can I take a look?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She shakes her head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why not?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s&#x2026; not time yet. Still learning from it&#x2026;&#x201D; she explains quietly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; you say, feeling just a little worried. At least, whatever it is, it shouldn&#x2019;t come into play while you are on the river.  Still, perhaps she shouldn&#x2019;t be reading those sort of books in public. You rub the seam around your shoulder absentmindedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;arm okay?&#x201D; asks Cao&#x2019;er.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, yes. Of course. You did a great job,&#x201D; you smile. Even Master Yao himself probably could not have done any better.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t stress it too much for now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Physician&#x2019;s orders?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She nods.<br>
<br>
Laughing, you pat her head. Then, you look around. Yifang is talking to Song Lingshu. &#x201C;I was just wondering&#x2026; are the two of you alright?&#x201D; With the Huashan Twins in close proximity on this trip, you had been reminded that Cao&#x2019;er and Yifang are still twin sisters. After some time it was easy to forget, as they interacted little in front of you.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er seems to understand what you are getting at immediately. &#x201C;No problem&#x2026; no need to worry&#x2026; no conflicts.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There being <i>nothing</i> is what I&#x2019;m worried about,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Perhaps you should spend some time with her once in a while. The trip up-river will be a good opportunity.&#x201D; You will try to think of something too &#x2013; perhaps the other girls will be able to help.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er giggles, her voice a hushed whisper. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry&#x2026; you must be wondering if I will be okay when you are not around. Not a problem&#x2026; we will always be together. Forever.&#x201D; You cannot see her face clearly, hidden as it is by her long hair, but she seems to be smiling.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian gives you that arrogant, know-it-all smile that you have come to expect from her when you approach. &#x201C;Yes, what is it?&#x201D; Though she greets you politely, you can tell that your presence is not entirely desirable.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I needed to speak with you about the Ten Swords Conference.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t that over and done with?&#x201D; she replies dismissively.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What <i>is </i>your master planning with the Xuanyuan Sword? I find it hard to believe that he would just hand it over to the Emperor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hasn&#x2019;t he made his intentions to you clear? It is of benefit to him from a political perspective. It could also serve as a way to intercede for the Zhang clan&#x2019;s latest mistakes at the moment, and make him the stronger partner in the relationship.&#x201D; She seems bored talking to you, as if you should already be able to figure all of this out by yourself and are wasting her time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure there is nothing else to it?&#x201D; you press.<br>
<br>
Bai falls silent in thought. Looking at you, she grins slightly. &#x201C;I suppose that as my partner, you <i>have </i>done well in stealing the credit for everyone to share. That at least should disrupt part of my <i>shifu</i>&#x2019;s plan. I should reward you for this, shouldn&#x2019;t I?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;By trying to kill me again?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not!&#x201D; She leans her head back gleefully, her shoulders shivering with laughter. &#x201C;What would you say if I told you that I found out just <i>where</i> the rumours of the manuals&#x2019; re-emergence started? What would you say, if I told you that it originated from the palace?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Does she mean to implicate the eunuchs or the Zhang clan? Or does she mean&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is a good, serious look you have in your eyes, Xu Jing,&#x201D; smiles Bai Jiutian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I just thought it would be nice to treat you seriously once in a while, lest you blow your top off one time too many,&#x201D; you say lightly, averting your eyes from hers. &#x201C;Why would the palace be involved in this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would not know. Perhaps you may be able to find out. Is there anything else you need to speak with me about?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You aren&#x2019;t telling me everything, are you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A gentleman never reveals all of his secrets,&#x201D; says Bai Jiutian smugly, as if she was actually one. &#x201C;If you want to know more, you have to offer me <i>more</i>. We are equal partners, are we not? Hm&#x2026; how about this? I am actually curious about what happened after the conference was disrupted by its host. If you tell me the whole truth about Taoying Island, I will tell you something else that I have found out about my <i>shifu </i>and <i>shimu</i>&#x2019;s plans. Do we have a deal?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You tell Bai Jiutian the truth about your fight with the immortal.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You tell Bai Jiutian about your fight with the immortal, but leave out certain pieces of vital information, such as Shun&#x2019;s true identity, and the real Xuanyuan Sword.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>No deal. You do not trust Bai Jiutian <i>that </i>much.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Liu Qi and Su Liaojing look up from their <i>weiqi</i> board as you arrive. It is rather clear that the Kunlun disciple is winning. &#x201C;Young Master Xu,&#x201D; he greets you with a bow. &#x201C;To what do we owe this pleasure?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nothing serious, really,&#x201D; you say, sitting down. &#x201C;I just thought it would be nice to get to know the both of you better, as fellow young pugilists.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see,&#x201D; murmurs Su. &#x201C;I thought you might still hold a grudge for Heihu Valley.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;Ah, you <i>did </i>beat me pretty soundly with that trick, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know you beat Man Tiger Pig in a match, Liaojing!&#x201D; exclaims Liu Qi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was merely lucky, and in the end he came out ahead,&#x201D; he says humbly.<br>
<br>
You remember Cao&#x2019;er helping you out by ambushing him, and then you had left him frozen in the middle of the battlefield. It was a rather humiliating fate; perhaps it was <i>he </i>who should hold a grudge instead. You shake your head. &#x201C;It was a good trick. I was overconfident.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Since you&#x2019;re here, Xu Jing, there is one thing I found curious,&#x201D; asks Liu Qi. &#x201C;How do you know&#x2026; <i>him</i>?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He must be referring to Shun. You give Liu a good shrug, and say, &#x201C;We go quite some ways back. In fact, I&#x2019;m actually surprised that <i>you </i>knew them, Brother Su.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have been in the palace workshops quite a few times as of late, invited to help with their projects related to fire medicine. They are&#x2026; greatly expanding on its uses. I have seen him there frequently, and though he did not reveal his true identity I had my suspicions,&#x201D; explains Su Liaojing, and he elaborates no further. &#x201C;The eunuch besides him I have never seen, but I sensed something dangerous about him. Clearly he is someone we should be careful of. You should take care too, Man Tiger Pig.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, he&#x2019;s just a softie once you get to know him better,&#x201D; you chuckle. Perhaps you have gotten too used to Gao Ying&#x2019;s presence, that his quiet menace no longer registered with you. You are not sure if that is a good or bad thing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is it such a good thing for us pugilists to be so closely involved with the palace?&#x201D; wonders Liu Qi out loud suddenly. Is he talking about himself, or is he talking about his masters? For now, you have no answer for him.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The travel upstream is comfortable and steady &#x2013; Nie is well-off enough to be able to hire three boats to accommodate the large number of travellers. It would take a few more days to get to the next point, but in the meantime, you could rest on the decks. You notice that Xuezi seems to be spending quite some time on the Huashan boat; she claims that she has been invited by Madam Nie to spend some time there, and that she will use this as an opportunity to dig out whatever information she can. When you tried to advise caution, she was rather rude in return&#x2026; but that is no surprise by now. She can probably handle herself, you think.<br>
<br>
The second day on the river brings with it an unexpected commotion.<br>
<br>
As you pop your head out of the covered deck, you see Bai Jiutian on the boat next to yours, looking towards the far bank. There, a familiar figure is waving around two axes, racing alongside the river on horseback, followed by a group of ten ragged men. Pursuing them, but lagging a fair distance behind, are at least a few dozen imperial soldiers. Pang Xiaohu rears his horse and reverses direction, riding past his surprised men and charging at the soldiers; apparently he is attempting to buy them time to escape.<br>
<br>
What is the Little Tiger doing here?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Jiutian, help out the soldiers in capturing those men,&#x201D; orders Nie Wuxing loudly. &#x201C;As orthodox pugilists, we cannot merely stand by and watch.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As you wish, master,&#x201D; bows Bai politely, but before he can leap into action, one of the Huashan Twins speaks up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father, let us assist!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing scowls. &#x201C;This is too dangerous!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
They argue for a very short while before deciding that the Twins should assist in capturing the fleeing followers, while Bai Jiutian goes after the leader.<br>
<br>
You do not feel like sitting here and watching the show; you have to intervene somehow.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You assist Bai Jiutian in taking down Pang Xiaohu. You do not know why he is here or being pursued by soldiers, but he <i>is </i>a bandit after all. It is not surprising.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You &#x2018;assist&#x2019; Bai Jiutian in taking down Pang Xiaohu. Even if you do not know why he is being pursued, finding a chance to let him go free at the moment might yield a reward later.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You assist the Huashan Twins in going after Pang&#x2019;s men. They might need the help; you are not sure if they are savvy enough to be going up against cut-throats and brigands.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You &#x2018;assist&#x2019; the Huashan Twins in going after Pang&#x2019;s men. Letting them escape should earn you the gratitude of the bandits, and they already seem beaten anyway.

            <h3>六十八 · Cutting Branch</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cutting Branch</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;What they desired was not the sword, but that which was hidden <i>inside </i>of it.&#x201D; Bai Jiutian had not revealed her own thoughts about your story of what happened on the island, but responded by telling you what she knew instead. And it seems that within the fake Xuanyuan Sword, a copy of the Xuanming Jiuyin Manual had been hidden. Bai did not know who provided that information to her master, but she is certain that Nie has acted on the assumption that it was true.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Have you seen it?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
She smiles enigmatically, and says, &#x201C;So far, only he and <i>shimu</i> know of the manual&#x2019;s existence. The rest of their allies have been kept in the dark, including Taishan, Kunlun or the Zhang clan.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And <i>you </i>managed to find out?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can be subtler than you think, when I need to be.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It certainly didn&#x2019;t stop your <i>shimu </i>from suspecting that there was something between us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Suspect?&#x201D; Bai laughs coldly. &#x201C;She had definite proof. Our little&#x2026; rendezvous left behind an unfortunate side-effect. She is keen enough about these matters that I could not conceal it from her. Well, in any case, I would have needed her help anyway.&#x201D; She gives her belly a light, mocking pat.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is none of your concern, Xu Jing. What is done is done. I would suggest that you turn your mind to more important things instead,&#x201D; she says amiably, turning away.<br>
<br>
Now, looking at Bai Jiutian as she crosses the river to intercept Pang Xiaohu, you wonder if you should have done anything differently. You don&#x2019;t know. Letting out an uncharacteristic sigh, you move to assist the Huashan Twins. Leaping off the boat, you move towards the far bank. The tips of your boots are wet by the water, but only slightly, as you skip across the river with a series of light, gliding steps.<br>
<br>
When you arrive, the Twins have engaged the bandits in battle; they have managed to slow down the bandits&#x2019; retreat with a sequence of graceful steps, moving together in tandem. You are quite sure the fight would go in their favour even if you did not step in, but their opponents do not seem to be unskilled amateurs themselves, and the bandits&#x2019; advantage in physical bulk and durability means that it would take the Twins a bit more than a few minutes to dispatch them.<br>
<br>
You are sure you can do slightly better.<br>
<br>
You let out a loud cough to draw their attention to your presence.<br>
<br>
At the sight of you, the fight stops immediately. The bandits seem tense, wondering what you are going to do.<br>
<br>
Nie Mudan &#x2013; the twin in green, and the one you had stripped a few years back &#x2013; shrinks back, while her blue-clad sister extends a protective arm in front of her. &#x201C;W-what are you doing here, Man Tiger Pig? Are you showing your true colours and attempting to help the bandits?&#x201D; demands Nie Shuixian.<br>
<br>
At her words, the bandits&#x2019; face appear to brighten up slightly with the colour of hope.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m here to help capture them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Some of the bandits make a grumble of disappointment. &#x201C;What? C&#x2019;mon, ya must be kidding me!&#x201D; exclaims a grizzled old veteran. &#x201C;Why would you help the orthodox pugilists?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do I seem like the sort of person who constantly explains his whims?&#x201D; you grin, moving towards them as you roll up your sleeves.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;S-sorry, friend, that was not a demand for an answer,&#x201D; he explains hurriedly, stepping back. &#x201C;Hey, brothers, this is it for us. I&#x2019;m not going up against <i>him</i>.&#x201D; The bandit drops his sabre and raises his arms as the Huashan Twins stare on in astonishment.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What? We <i>still </i>outnumber them at least three to one,&#x201D; complains a younger looking ruffian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really? I&#x2019;d rather surrender to the soldiers than enjoy ten-to-one odds against the One-Eyed Tiger! At least I&#x2019;d still get a proper trial, and have arms to feed myself with in prison, and getting me head chopped is an easier way to go than fighting him too,&#x201D; snaps the older bandit.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Be a coward if you want, but Big Brother Pang would be ashamed of you!&#x201D; cries out the young bandit. &#x201C;We proud remnants of the Bandit Kingdom will not back down from a single man!&#x201D; Hefting his axe aloft, he charges at you with a cry. From his posture, speed and balance, you can tell that he is a skilled fighter; he would have posed a challenge to you, about two years back.<br>
<br>
Folding your hands behind your back, you deftly step back, the edge of his axe barely missing your clothes as it whistles past the front of your chest. The young bandit grinds his heel into the ground and spins, whirling around for another blow from the side of your covered eye. It seems like he has the presence of mind to exploit apparent weaknesses too. You are almost impressed. You duck, letting his swing pass over your head harmlessly. Your right hand reaches out and plucks a short branch &#x2013; almost a twig &#x2013; from the ground. Concentrating and imposing the order of control on your inner energy, you feel your <i>qi </i>changing as it flows through the Sword Saint&#x2019;s arm and into the branch.<br>
<br>
As you rise, the bandit attempts to bring his axe down on the top of your skull. You side-step his attack, making a circular shift to the side as you utilize the principles of Taiji to draw him off balance &#x2013; at the same time, you strike out with the branch in your hand. The rough, thin stick shears off the axe-head at the shaft. The bandit squeezes his eyes shut as he yells out in fear, your branch lashing towards him in a blur of movement.<br>
<br>
What he gets is a hard tap across his cheek.<br>
<br>
As he open his eyes in surprise, you toss the branch away. &#x201C;Really, now, you should play a bit fairer next time, my friend. I didn&#x2019;t even have time to draw my sword,&#x201D; you say, patting the wodao at your side. The bandit&#x2019;s fingers run over the angry red welt forming across his cheek while his knees give way; you think you spy a dark patch at the seat of his pants, but you make no mention of it. The other bandits have all thrown down their weapons and are sitting in a subdued circle, cursing their luck.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right, so all that&#x2019;s left is to wait for the soldiers to arrive&#x2026;&#x201D; Turning, you see the Huashan Twins striding towards you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Where&#x2026; where did you learn how to form such perfect sword <i>qi</i>?&#x201D; demands Nie Shuixian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I thought you were just a mediocre swordsman! Even your master is not known for his skils with a blade,&#x201D; adds her sister.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why are the two of you so concerned about my sword skills?&#x201D; you chuckle.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are a threat to our father,&#x201D; declares Nie Mudan.&#x201D;&#x2026;and to Bai <i>shixiong</i>, too. If you are practising some strange, demonic art to grow stronger, we cannot let you be.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is our duty to investigate and interrogate suspicious unorthodox behaviour, and your sudden increase in prowess definitely qualifies as such,&#x201D; says Nie Shuixian. &#x201C;As such, we challenge you to an honourable duel, to settle this suspicion.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You have to admire their total lack of subtlety, for girls that were supposedly brought up by Madam Nie; it looks like Bai was the one who received the benefits of that tutelage. These two seem to have bought in entirely into the orthodox-pugilist-fighting-for-justice concept, like Yifang and Lingshu&#x2026; no, they might be even <i>more </i>na&#xEF;ve, with strong loyalty to their adopted parents.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The two of you are <i>really </i>filial, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; you say with a kind, amused smile, and that elicits an embarrassed blush from the twins immediately. Before they can respond, some soldiers arrive to take the bandits into custody. It looks like Bai Jiutian has successfully subdued Pang Xiaohu with little difficulty. Not that you would expect anything less of her.<br>
<br>
You talk to the commanding officer of the squad, as he looks over his men getting to work tying up the bandits. There, you find out something surprising: it seems that the Bandit Kingdom has been hit hard by Imperial forces just a couple of weeks ago, and Pang Xiaohu had been fleeing to the east ever since. The soldiers here have been dispatched from Xiangyang, and will be bringing him back there to stand trial for his banditry. A death sentence would be likely for them though not yet absolutely certain.<br>
<br>
You are travelling to the same destination, but you do not have the reputation to negotiate for Pang Xiaohu and his bandits to be escorted by your group &#x2013; it would take a bit longer compared to marching with the soldiers, but they would get there regardless. Nie Wuxing does have such a reputation, but you definitely know what he would say about the whole idea. Perhaps you could manage to convince him&#x2026; you glance at the Twins: they might be of help.<br>
<br>
Still, there is this pre-existing suspicion of your martial arts in their minds that you would have to get past&#x2026; you have a feeling that regardless of whether or not you seek their help, they are not letting you back on that boat without an answer.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You explain to the Twins that you had lost your arm, and it was replaced with the Sword Saint&#x2019;s. Hopefully they will accept this answer; it is the truth after all, and if they doubt it, they can check with the Saint, a known pillar of righteousness.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>If they are <i>that </i>insistent on you being a practitioner of demonic arts, perhaps you can duel them and demonstrate that the only thing demonic about you is your uncanny ability to tease them.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You do not give them an explanation or the satisfaction of having a duel. Your skills are of no concern to them.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>1. </b>You attempt to ask for the Nie family&#x2019;s help in negotiating to escort Pang Xiaohu to Xiangyang.<br>
<br>
<b>2. </b>You do not ask to escort Pang Xiaohu to Xiangyang. If the trial is of concern to you, you can only hope you arrive in time to witness it.

            <h3>六十九 · Duel on the Water</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Duel on the Water</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, if you want to play, I am always up for it,&#x201D; you say, spreading your arms wide as you take a few steps back.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We will put your control to the test, Man Tiger Pig. Perhaps we will give you a little scar on your head to remember this by, if you slip up.&#x201D; Drawing their swords confidently, they take up a formation stance that you do not recognize. You just smile at them. Nie Shuixian acts first, darting towards you with a speedy lunge. The point of her sword races towards you in a deceptive manner, winking in and out of your vision dangerously, and you immediately understand that the twins aren&#x2019;t exactly opponents you can beat with a branch.<br>
<br>
You match her speed on the draw, unsheathing your wodao with your right hand. Without moving your feet a single inch, you parry her jab with a pinpoint slash, using your superior strength to knock her off-balance. Before you can capitalize on the opening, her sister has already leapt forward to assist. Nie Mudan swoops down from above with a powerful attack, the pull of the earth aiding her strike. Drawing a circle with your wodao, you unhurriedly slide your blade along hers until you hit her guard, and with a gentle twist, bring her down to the ground, dispersing the force of her attack with your circular movements.<br>
<br>
Nie Mudan manages to land on her feet, and both sisters retreat briefly. &#x201C;Was that move&#x2026; Wudang&#x2019;s Taiji?&#x201D; asks Nie Shuixian, surprised.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re the orthodox pugilist, <i>you </i>tell me,&#x201D; you shrug, waving your sword in their faces. &#x201C;Have I passed your test? That was rather quick.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not!&#x201D; The twins go on the attack again with precise, flowing movements as they dance around you and begin performing a series of elegant slashes and jabs. Their control over their technique is quite remarkable; you are not sure if you would be able to manage the same. The softness of their attacks gives you trouble; you are unable to execute your Taiji Sword to maximum effectiveness &#x2013; at your current level of understanding, you find a furious, forceful assault easier to deal with than a gentle but constantly changing pattern of attack. Switching things up, you give your arm over to instinct to defend against the twins&#x2019; relentless pressure; as if sensing the flow of their swordplay, you often find yourself already moving your wodao into position a split-second before they begin their strike. Without missing a beat, you parry each and every one of their attacks, using hard strength to counter their soft movements. Your blade flashes brilliantly, slashing out a sphere of protection around you that breaks up their formation entirely and repels them from your vicinity.<br>
<br>
You blow out the breath that you had been holding in as you relax your stance; you have still not budged from your spot even slightly. &#x201C;Well, that should be-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
After just the briefest of pauses, the twins set upon you again, determination set upon their faces.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stubborn little-&#x201C; Your right arm twinges, sending a sharp pain shooting up the limb when you attempt to bring your sword back into position. It looks like you are stressing it a bit much at the moment. Deciding not to force the issue, you snap the wodao back into its sheath instead and make a nimble hop backwards, retreating from the sisters just as their swords pierce the dirt where you had been standing. &#x201C;What <i>do </i>I have to do to pass this test?&#x201D; you call out, trying to lure them into conversation. &#x201C;For that matter, why are you so intent on thinking that I am a threat to your father?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your glib tongue may fool the other sects, but we are not so easily taken in!&#x201D; Nie Mudan rushes in to take advantage of what she sees as an opportunity. You are pressed back, towards the river, narrowly dodging each of her moves by a hair.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Something strange is going on in the pugilistic world, and it&#x2019;s not hard to figure out that you might have something to do with it.&#x201D; Nie Shuixian comes in low from your right, attempting to blindside you with the hilt of her sword. Seeing no way out, you leap towards the river. As you skim across the water, they pursue you back towards the boats. &#x201C;Besides, our fathersaid that he suspected you of being after the legendary manuals so that you could bring bloodshed and terror to the <i>jianghu</i>,&#x201D; she says, continuing her attack. &#x201C;If you are hiding any evil skills from those manuals, we will force you to reveal it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, why don&#x2019;t you ask your Bai-<i>shixiong </i>his opinion about this matter?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course he thinks that you are a vile, evil pervert!&#x201D; comes the reply in perfect synchronicity.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, <i>now </i>he says that? Well, I suppose he knows me quite intimately&#x2026;&#x201D; you sigh.<br>
<br>
This appears to anger them. &#x201C;Stop your slanderous lies!&#x201D; shouts Nie Mudan, charging forward. Her guard is off. With a quick, subtle move, you dart forward, your toes splashing water, and slide your hand in to grab her sleeve. She cries out in alarm at your sudden proximity. &#x201C;No, not again!&#x201D; Her sister hurries forth to help, but now their concentration is broken and their movements messy. A quick flurry of moves results in both of them losing their focus and dropping into the water. You leap onto a nearby reed, balancing on top of it as you wait.<br>
<br>
They do not seem to be coming up.<br>
<br>
Muttering a short curse, you dive into the water a few seconds later. You find them quickly; it looks like their nice, expensive clothes have gotten water-logged and are weighing them down. Taking out your dagger, you cut open their outer garments as the two sisters cling onto you in a panic. Then, kicking out strongly, you swim towards the surface. You manage to reach the deck of your boat safely, carrying the wet, protesting twins in your arms,. You&#x2019;ll return them in a short while, after they&#x2019;ve calmed down and you have had the chance to talk to them. They still seem to be in a bit of a shock after that near-drowning.<br>
<br>
Yunzi pokes her head out of the tent flap and frowns. &#x201C;What is this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hm, just a little-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just what are you doing to my daughters!?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A loud roar startles you. Whirling around, you see Nie Wuxing charging from his boat towards yours, his beard bristling with his unrestrained fury. He throws a palm towards you; you are forced to drop one of the twins to defend yourself. Quickly stretching out a foot to support Shuixian&#x2019;s body, you meet Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s palm with your own. Immediately, you wince; his internal strength is deep enough to surpass Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s, and definitely more than a match for your own. He does not seem to be striking to kill, however, and you manage to hold your own.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is the meaning of this, Xu Jing?&#x201D; he growls. Behind you, Qilin, Yunzi and Armaiti have sprung out onto the deck, ready for a fight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We were just having a friendly sparring session,&#x201D; you explain. Nie Wuxing doesn&#x2019;t seem to buy it, and the pressure from his palm increases. You try to hold it back. &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t believe me, perhaps we can let the maidens down first and then ask them about it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
With a frown, Nie pulls back, taking his daughters with him. He swiftly begins asking them questions.<br>
<br>
Did Xu Jing touch you anywhere inappropriate?<br>
<br>
Where are your clothes?<br>
<br>
Did he try to strip you again?<br>
<br>
And so on, and so forth.<br>
<br>
Luckily, to their credit, the twins do not lie, or play up the story. They admit to being the ones who started the fight. Nie Wuxing grudgingly accepts their tale and turns to you. &#x201C;I see. I may have jumped to conclusions. My&#x2026; apologies, Xu Jing,&#x201D; he says, bowing his head slightly in forced contrition. &#x201C;I will have to lecture my daughters on the value of knowing the appropriate time and place for everything.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No apologies needed,&#x201D; you grin, &#x201C;But&#x2026;&#x201D; You make your request.<br>
<br>
The scowl returns to Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s face. As he leaves, Nie Shuixian turns back and mumbles a word of thanks, although her soggy sister only sticks her tongue out at you.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The orthodox pugilists agreed to escort Pang Xiaohu and his bandits to Xiangyang. The soldiers seemed to be rather grateful for the offer, and rode on ahead to let the prefect know of Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s imminent arrival with his entourage. Pang Xiaohu and his friends would sit with the Wudang contingent, the Sword Saint and his disciple, as ordered by Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
When you visit later that night, Pang gives you a sorry sigh. &#x201C;Brother, if you wanted to help me, you could have just let the soldiers take me. It would have been easier for me to escape from them than from these stuck up bastards.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Wudang disciples do not react to his taunts. Guo Fu nods, the only person there who is taller and larger than Pang Xiaohu. &#x201C;Yes, it is harder to escape from us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was not- oh, forget it,&#x201D; grumbles the Little Tiger, not in a good mood. &#x201C;So, why are you here, Xu Jing?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You explain that you are here to ask him about how he ended up here. He gives you a good, long laugh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is a funny story. You remember that constable in Youxia? The fella who went nuts at the trial?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Fu Xia. Yes, you remember him.<br>
<br>
Pang continues calmly, &#x201C;We were attacked by hundreds of crazy fighters like him. It was a mercenary army hired by the Zhang clan, apparently in a bid to show that they are loyal to the Emperor and are willing to wipe out his enemies for him.&#x201D; Upon further questioning, Pang appears to be reticent to reveal anything more that he knows; you suspect that he knows the origin of those fighters, but he is not telling you anything more for now. Perhaps you will have the opportunity to find out more once you reach Xiangyang.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What of it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
When you approach Xuezi about her dalliances with Madam Nie, she remains belligerent about the whole matter, even when you reveal that the Nies might be hiding the Jiuyin manual.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course I knew,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;That woman told me herself. Why do you think I am trying to infiltrate them?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t tell me,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And? What would you do if I told you? Would you be willing to help me steal it? If not, leave me alone. I know what I&#x2019;m doing here,&#x201D; she says, sulking.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You attempt to steal the Jiuyin manual for Xuezi. Even though neither of you have any clear idea where it might be, since you are on the river it must be somewhere on their boat. Perhaps you can ask to look the fake Xuanyuan Sword, or subtly investigate their belongings if that does not pan out.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>It is too risky to make such a move at this moment. You attempt to convince Xuezi that she should stop approaching Madam Nie by herself &#x2013; she wants a promise from you in return that you will do one single thing that she asks for in the future, with no conditions. If you grant her that promise, she&#x2019;ll listen to you.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You let Xuezi be for now and merely attempt to keep an eye on her: she seems like she know what she is doing. If she runs into trouble you will help her out, but if her plan works out it may turn out to be better for the both of you.

            <h3>七十 · Banhe Town</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Banhe Town</span></b><br>
<br>
The river journey ends without any further surprises: the boats dock at the jetties of Banhe Town, a bustling little place full of trade activity. From here, it is only a short distance to Xiangyang over land. You would stay here for a night before resuming your journey in the morning. The bandits get off with you here, unbound and unrestrained. Some of the orthodox pugilists had thought it barbaric to keep them tied up, instead electing to keep an eye on them personally. So far it has not given them any problems &#x2013; Pang Xiaohu and his men do not seem inclined to make a break for it. Perhaps they realize that they would not be able to get far, not when surrounded by so many masters.<br>
<br>
Xuezi had kept her word and stayed away from visiting Madam Nie. You are unsure what request she would make in the future, but you hope that it would not cause a headache to you. Hopefully it will end up being nothing more than a demand for some snacks. Sighing, you finish moving the belongings into the room by yourself; the girls have gone out into town to visit its famed market while they can &#x2013; the craftsmen here are renowned for their ability in carving intricate little trinkets. You sit, resting your elbows on the small, round table.<br>
<br>
There is a knock at the open door.<br>
<br>
You look up. Madam Nie is standing there, smiling gently.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hello. I do hope that I am not interrupting your private time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It would have been too much to expect that she would overlook Xuezi suddenly distancing herself, you suppose.<br>
<br>
You return the smile as naturally as you can. &#x201C;Of course not, madam. What can I do for you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Without being invited, she swoops into the room and takes a seat right beside you. &#x201C;Nothing taxing. Not yet, at least.&#x201D; Her eyes glint. &#x201C;I was just feeling bored. My husband is off talking business with his fellow leaders of the Eight Sects, the twins have gone off to the market with Tian&#x2019;er, and you seem to have stolen my little conversation partner away from me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Steal? Oh, Madam Nie, that is such a strong word to use,&#x201D; you laugh. &#x201C;You are wrong, too. Xuezi is a capricious little girl. Her whims change as the winds blow.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is no need to dance around the point, Xu Jing.&#x201D; She shakes her head, and says quietly, &#x201C;Oh, that child is not as half as smart as she thinks she is. You already know about the Jiuyin Manual, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, I can&#x2019;t say I don&#x2019;t <i>know </i>about it. I think every martial artist worth his salt knows about these legendary manuals, Madam Nie.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Still playing coy, I see.&#x201D; Her smile widens. &#x201C;Xu Jing, you are an intelligent young man. There are no need for such games.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is the only way I can defend myself from your charms, Madam Nie,&#x201D; you say earnestly. &#x201C;If I do not put up the pretense of playing a game with you, I&#x2019;m afraid you will bring down my fortress in seconds.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
To your surprise, she giggles fetchingly, and you can see in her flashes of the mature, charming woman that Qilin will gradually &#x2013; well, possibly &#x2013; become in the years to come. &#x201C;I suppose that is the tongue that felled my daughter, hm? Interesting. So, why are you acting antagonistically to everything we do, Xu Jing?&#x201D; Madam Nie changes the topic quickly, leaving you trying to think of a quick response.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Am I? Have I not fulfilled your husband&#x2019;s wishes by suggesting this expedition?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, you know what I mean. Have you not thought this before: that you might be making a mistake by acting without understanding the full picture? You do not really know our motives, our plans, and what we might hope to achieve. Have you never once thought that you might be making things worse by acting blindly?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Please, Madam Nie. Do I look like the sort of person who thinks deeply about what he should do before he goes and does it?&#x201D; you laugh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026; perhaps not, but you <i>are </i>an intelligent young man, as I said. I am sure you understand the power of knowledge. Whenever I look at you, I feel a certain&#x2026; something...&#x201D; Madam Nie brings her hand to her chest. &#x201C;I am not sure how to express it, but I would feel bad if I let such a promising young man continue running around, wilfully oblivious to your surroundings.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Promising? Did you not doubt my suitability for your daughter?&#x201D; you point out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I must say that I am not yet convinced,&#x201D; she smiles. &#x201C;Perhaps you will have a chance to prove to me that you have the ability to make my daughter happy&#x2026; in all matters personal. Perhaps&#x2026; tonight. I am quite familiar with Banhe Town, as I spent some time here when I was younger than Qilin is now. There is a place just on the outskirts where we can talk in private. What do you say?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You are not accepting any of her suggestions. It is probably a trap. You will stay away as far as you can.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You meet with her later tonight. The promise of what she can tell outweighs the possible danger; besides, you are confident in your ability to escape if necessary. Still, she did not emphasize that you should show up alone&#x2026; perhaps you can bring someone along with you?<br>
<b>I. </b>Qilin<br>
<b>II. </b>Cao&#x2019;er<br>
<b>III. </b>Xuezi<br>
<b>IV. </b>Bai Jiutian<br>
<b>V. </b>Huashan Twins<br>
<b>VI. </b>Liu Qi and Su Liaojing<br>
<b>VII. </b>You go alone

            <h3>七十一 · Meeting in Old Banhe</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Meeting in Old Banhe</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why did you agree to come along in the first place?&#x201D; Nie Mudan speaks nervously and accusingly, clutching onto her sister&#x2019;s sleeves. The path that Madam Nie had suggested that you follow to the meeting spot is rather dark and eerie, and the Huashan Twin Flowers are rather unsettled.<br>
<br>
Nie Shuixian shakes her head, and gives an uncertain reply. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve always wanted to press Mother about certain issues, haven&#x2019;t we? I thought this would be a good chance.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As if! You were just interested in going along with the pervert, weren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not!&#x201D; comes the vehement denial.<br>
<br>
You let out a groan of annoyance as you try to keep your lantern steady. &#x201C;Could the two of you please keep it down, and not talk about me like I&#x2019;m not here? We&#x2019;re almost there.&#x201D; You had tried to get the twins to stay hidden, but they just weren&#x2019;t trained for it; you found it highly doubtful that Madam Nie would be unable to detect their presence. So you gave up. You do not even know how you convinced them to come along in the first place; it had only been a whim of yours that strangely succeeded when Nie Shuixian agreed without a second thought. Nie Mudan had felt obliged to tag along, unwilling to let her sister venture into strange, dark places along with a known molester.<br>
<br>
You arrive at the little clearing surrounded by buildings in disrepair; an older section of Banhe Town, abandoned when the small tributary flowing through this area dried up.. There is no one in sight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;T-t-t-there&#x2019;s no one around. W-were we lured here so that he could have his way with us?&#x201D; gasps Mudan.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D; Shuixian is wary now, the twin sisters backing away from you while clinging onto each other. Perhaps coming along with you <i>was</i> a bad idea after all, given your reputation for lechery. &#x201C;Maybe we should wait for a while, until that woman shows up.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>That woman</i>? Is that how you address your mother?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You whip around as fast as you can, confronting the voice behind you. The shadows appear to part, revealing Madam Nie as she steps forward, holding a small lantern in her hand. She looks directly at the twins. &#x201C;What are the two of you doing here?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;To catch you in the act of betraying Father,&#x201D; says Shuixian challengingly. &#x201C;Meeting with a man in the night, just by yourself&#x2026; what were you thinking, Mother?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really, Xu Jing? You expect me to talk to you with these two girls around?&#x201D; Madam Nie&#x2019;s lips curl up in a smile. &#x201C;And as for the two of you, I could say the same. Why, if your father <i>knew </i>that you had walked off to a deserted place in the middle of the night together with the infamous Man Tiger Pig, known for having a bevy of women all over the country&#x2026; what would he think?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Given what you have seen of Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s protectiveness towards his daughters, he would think nothing good of you. But you already knew that.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You won&#x2019;t distract us from what really matters, Mother,&#x201D; says Mudan. &#x201C;We already know that you have been guiding Father down a heretical path. We know about the convicts in the prison, and how you have been chasing after the legendary manuals at all costs.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have been a little more perceptive than I gave you credit for, my dears,&#x201D; says Madam Nie dismissively, &#x201C;but you still know nothing. This is nothing more than paranoid speculation.&#x201D; She puts one hand to her chin, as if a thought suddenly struck her. &#x201C;Oh, perhaps&#x2026; are you jealous of your baby brother? Are you scared that your father will pay less attention to you now that he has an actual heir that can carry on the family line?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not!&#x201D; cries out Shuixian. &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t about Baojun.&#x201D; Shuixian looks slightly pale after hearing Madam Nie&#x2019;s words, but rallies together quickly, her brow set in determination. &#x201C;You are one to talk, but are you really the Liao Xiuyue that Father loved?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why, yes, that is my name,&#x201D; she replies, her well-groomed eyebrows arching up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really? We think-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
Madam Nie raises a hand, giving them a pitying look. &#x201C;Wuxing only took the both of you in because your departed father was his sworn brother, did you know that? The obligations of an orthodox pugilist, and all that. It certainly wasn&#x2019;t his first choice.  I am sure you knew that. That is why you are being so rebellious as of late, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2026; we didn&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; mumbles Mudan.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, that is alright. It does not change anything at all,&#x201D; continues Madam Nie. &#x201C;Stop this foolishness and realize that your father and I have come to love the both of you like our own, after all these years. Your little brother will not change the relationship between us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have heard of Liao Xiuyue,&#x201D; you interrupt jovially and suddenly, changing the topic of your own initiative. &#x201C;Chi Tianxie had plenty to say about her.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Madam Nie smiles at you, but her heart clearly isn&#x2019;t into it. &#x201C;What that man has to say is irrelevant.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You consider your past irrelevant, Madam Nie?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course. I made mistakes back then. The follies of youth. The both of you would do well to keep that in mind when&#x2026; consorting with undesirable elements,&#x201D; she says, addressing the twins.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You consider Qilin a mistake? I suppose I shall have to tell her that,&#x201D; you say sadly.<br>
<br>
A rare flash of anger surfaces in Madam Nie&#x2019;s eyes as she struggles to keep her voice calm and in control. &#x201C;&#x2026;that is not what I meant. Qilin is&#x2026; I do not regret having her.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Okay. If you say so,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;Perhaps we can move on to more important things now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps not. I have wasted enough time with you and your tricks. I should have known better than to treat you like an adult,&#x201D; she sniffs. &#x201C;Girls, it is time to go back. I am sure you understand the importance of keeping what happened tonight a secret. It is for your father&#x2019;s peace of mind.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There is an awkward, prolonged silence as the twins stand around, not doing anything. You wonder if you should act.<br>
<br>
And then, Nie Shuixian speaks up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201D; She unsheathes her sword, eliciting a look of surprise from Nie Mudan. &#x201C;There are many things you have to answer for, <i>Mother</i>. Tonight we will get the whole truth from you whether you like it or not. What you have been doing&#x2026; and who you really are.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Well, <i>this </i>isn&#x2019;t what you expected. Then again, you realize that you do not know much about Shuixian and Mudan. Perhaps, in a way, this should have been an outcome that does not surprise you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is the meaning of this?&#x201D; says Madam Nie exasperatedly. &#x201C;Are you not taking your youthful rebelliousness a little too far? Mudan, talk some sense into your sister.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I am with Shuixian,&#x201D; stammers Mudan as she too draws her weapon. &#x201C;I am afraid of you, and <i>for </i>you, Mother. I don&#x2019;t think whatever you are planning will end up going well for our family and for Huashan. We have to stop you here.&#x201D; It looks like the Huashan Twins seem to know quite a bit about Madam Nie&#x2019;s plans, though they had not seen fit to share their knowledge with you. This might be a good opportunity for you to join hands with them and help them capture their mother.<br>
<br>
Madam Nie sighs loudly. &#x201C;So it came down to this. Very well. Tian&#x2019;er, you can come out now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
There is a slight thickening of the shadows behind her, gradually solidifying into a familiar silhouette as it approaches the light. Bai Jiutian steps out, looking extremely composed. She glances at you, and then at the twins. Though you had remained alert ever since you entered the clearing, you had failed to detect her presence.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Bai-<i>shixiong</i>&#x2026;&#x201D; murmurs Shuixian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am disappointed,&#x201D; says Bai. &#x201C;Why are the two of you here? <i>Shifu </i>would be extremely displeased if he found out you were dallying with Man Tiger Pig.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No! It&#x2019;s not what you think!&#x201D; protests Mudan. &#x201C;We were just-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Enough.&#x201D; Bai cuts her off. &#x201C;What do you want to do, <i>shimu</i>?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Madam Nie closes her eyes in thought, and then smiles. She says, &#x201C;We will have to take the two girls back for re-education and discipline. They have been entirely too wayward as of late, exhibiting behaviour unbefitting a daughter of the Nie household.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And what about Xu Jing?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do <i>you</i> think we should do?&#x201D; she asks, staring at him.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian looks at you quietly for a while. &#x201C;He is too powerful for us to defeat without a prolonged fight, or giving him the chance to get away. Perhaps we can pretend none of this ever happened, and go back to the status quo,&#x201D; she suggests. &#x201C;That would be wiser, if Xu Jing agrees.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop talking about me like I&#x2019;m not here,&#x201D; you complain. &quot;Madam Nie, I feel let down. I thought you wanted this to be a private encounter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are one to talk!&quot; she laughs cheerfully, before winking. &quot;Well, I suppose the two of us are not so different after all, though Tian&apos;er had orders not to do anything unless I said so. I was just being cautious... if things went as we planned, you would never have known he was here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Bai-<i>shixiong</i>, even if we have to fight you, we will not stand down,&#x201D; declares Shuixian nervously.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian shakes her head. &#x201C;Stop being foolish. Now, come home with us. I&#x2019;m sure that <i>shifu </i>and <i>shimu </i>will explain everything. They just cannot do so in the presence of an outsider. Am I right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Madam Nie nods sagely. &#x201C;Yes, of course you are, Tian&#x2019;er. We will tell you everything after you have been disciplined for your behaviour. Don&#x2019;t make the mistake of thinking that we do not care for you, Shuixian, Mudan.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It seems that the Twins are undecided at the moment. It may be safer to stick to the status quo, and go away with the small amount of knowledge that you have gleaned from this encounter. Shuixian and Mudan <i>are </i>family after all; Nie Wuxing would not let any harm come to them. They should be safe if you persuade them to lay down their arms.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You convince Nie Shuixian and Nie Mudan that they should return to Madam Nie, and agree to maintain the current situation. You escort them back to the inn, so that no misunderstandings with Nie Wuxing develop. You will have gained only a little from the excursion but lost little in return.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b> You convince Nie Shuixian and Nie Mudan to make a run for it with you. Somehow, you cannot bring yourself to trust that they will be entirely unharmed if they return at this moment; Madam Nie does not strike you as the sort to leave loose ends hanging. They may not be killed, but you cannot rule out any other foul trickery either.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You stand with Nie Shuixian and Nie Mudan in their fight. If that is what they want to do, you see no harm in supporting them. Besides, if you manage to capture Madam Nie for interrogation it would allow you to learn plenty.<br>
<b>1. </b>You go after Madam Nie, leaving Bai Jiutian to the twins. Bai might not be willing to go all out against them, allowing them to buy time even if they are terribly outclassed.<br>
<b>2. </b>You go after Bai Jiutian, leaving Madam Nie to the twins. Of the two, you feel that Bai is considerably more skilled, and a more difficult challenge. The twins should be able to subdue Madam Nie with a two-on-one advantage.

            <h3>七十二 · Old Street Retreat</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Old Street Retreat</span></b><br>
<br>
You sidle up to Nie Shuixian and whisper firmly, &#x201C;Now is not the time to get into an argument with them. I do not think you are going to like your mother&#x2019;s &#x2018;discipline&#x2019;.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She seems to agree, albeit somewhat nervously. &#x201C;But, what should-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
Stepping in between the twins and Madam Nie, you adjust your sleeves. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s employ my favourite of the Thirty-Six Strategems.&#x201D; Without warning, you whip around and strike out at the two girls with your palms. Controlling your <i>qi </i>perfectly, you generate just enough force to send them flying off without causing them serious injury. &#x201C;Retreat!&#x201D; you shout out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Tian&#x2019;er, go after them. Even if we cannot detain Xu Jing, we can still bring the girls back,&#x201D; orders Madam Nie.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian prepares to give chase, but stops immediately. You are standing in her way, your hands resting on your hips. She is wary enough that she does not make any rash attempts to force a path past you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Staying behind to let them escape? How noble of you, Man Tiger Pig,&#x201D; she sneers. &#x201C;Or do you have something else in mind?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you going to fight us alone?&#x201D; Madam Nie smiles at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x201D; You take a step forward. And kick up a spray of dirt into their faces. With a mocking laugh, you leap away, following the path where the twins had fled. You catch up to them quite soon; the deteriorating wooden rooftops are proving to be rather hard to step on without risking them giving way under you, while the streets below are dark and abandoned. You do not expect Bai Jiutian or Madam Nie to be left behind for long. Just as Nie Shuixian notices you and waves, your instincts warn you to dodge. You drop down, turning your run into a tumbling roll as a gleaming sword passes through where your chest would have been. As you get to your feet, Bai Jiutian presses the attack, lunging at you with a swift stab. You block her attack with your wodao and draw the blade, forcing Bai to leap back.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are really trying to kill me, aren&#x2019;t you? I thought we were friends.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She smiles. &#x201C;If you die, it just means you weren&#x2019;t good enough to be my ally in the first place.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Bai <i>shixiong</i>!&#x201D; Nie Mudan cries out. &#x201C;Why? Why are you doing this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have my reasons,&#x201D; replies Bai. &#x201C;Besides, you should be a good girl and come home, Mudan. If you insist on being so stubborn you will ruin everything, even your father&#x2019;s plans.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Keep moving!&#x201D; you shout. &#x201C;Head for the inn!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-yes!&#x201D; Shuixian complies with you immediately, herding her sister away.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t let you.&#x201D; Bai&#x2019;s shadow appears to lengthen &#x2013; she seems to glide across the darkness with surprising speed, almost catching you off-guard.<br>
<br>
Almost.<br>
<br>
Your right arm reacts before you can think, striking out at Bai Jiutian with the flat of your sword. As Bai dodges your attack, her attempt to get past you foiled, you leap into the air. At the same time, you unleash a downward strike with your left palm &#x2013; The Soaring Dragon Descends &#x2013; and with a loud, crashing noise, you bring down the roof under her feet. It does not buy you much time. Bai Jiutian kicks up the smashed wooden planks and steps off of them lightly, using them as footholds in mid-air to regain her balance. She charges towards you, and the two of you clash swords again, with only the wind beneath your feet.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are quite the show-off, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are the <i>last</i> person I want to hear that from.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Laughing, you spin and kick out from an impossible position. In aerial combat your Wuying Leipo Kick gives you the advantage. You turn Bai into your stepping stone, sending her flying backwards while you hurtle towards the lights of the populated sections. Bai wastes no time in coming after you, apparently forgetting about her mission to retrieve the twins and proceeding to start a running duel through the dark streets and creaky rooftops of the abandoned town. You slip in and out of the shadows, attempting to give her the slip, but Bai is nothing but persistent. Still, you can tell that she is not yet giving her all. Of course, neither are you.<br>
<br>
Even as you think that, you make a single misstep. A black cat &#x2013; some stray surviving on scraps in this dump &#x2013; scampers across your path with a yowl, startled by your sudden arrival. Even as you adjust your footing to avoid the cat, you realize that by doing so you have slowed down a beat and given Bai Jiutian just the chance she needs to catch up to you. She reaches out for you, her sword poised to skewer you and a smile on her face.<br>
<br>
You wonder if she isn&#x2019;t enjoying this a little too much.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>Shixiong</i>, watch out!&#x201D; shouts Shuixian, appearing from above and slashing at her senior. This gives Bai plenty of time to evade. She breaks off her attack and spins away elegantly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>Shixiong</i>!&#x201D; This time it is Mudan&#x2019;s turn, and similarly, Bai evades her attack with ease.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If the two of you are going to call out a warning, what is the point of trying an ambush?&#x201D; you yell.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;B-but&#x2026; we just can&#x2019;t bring ourselves to really harm Bai <i>shixiong</i>!&#x201D; explains Shuixian.<br>
<br>
Mudan adds her retort: &#x201C;Besides, we saved you, didn&#x2019;t we?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps you should have saved yourselves.&#x201D; Madam Nie swoops in; catching Nie Mudan by surprise, she plants a needle in her neck, immobilizing the girl. Just when did she sneak up on you? You glance at Bai, who does not seem surprised; she was probably just the decoy all along. Madam Nie turns towards Shuixian, and you move to intercept her. Bai does not seem inclined to let you interfere, however, and with a flash of her sword she cuts off your advance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Mother, what are you planning?&#x201D; cries out Shuixian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hush. You will know everything soon enough-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
Madam Nie whirls around suddenly, whipping her long sleeves in a circle. Bai too leaps back, her sword moving in a swift arc around her. A dozen tinny, clinging sounds ring out as she deflects as many needles; you see that Madam Nie too has caught an array of needles safely, letting them drop to the ground.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Tch&#x2026; didn&#x2019;t hit&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er pokes her head out from a nearby roof, frustration etched on her face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see. This is your doing, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; Madam Nie looks up.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why, a good wife never lets her husband wander off without taking certain precautions, even if it has to be behind his back.&#x201D; Qilin is perched on the rooftops, swinging her legs in a carefree manner. &#x201C;Hi, dear.&#x201D; With a light hop, she reaches you and wraps herself around your arm possessively.<br>
<br>
Yunzi, Armaiti, Lingshu and Yifang appear on the roof opposite, and there is a glint of excitement in the Holy Maiden&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201C;This should be a good chance to get some answers,&#x201D; she says, cracking her knuckles in a very unladylike manner. Lingshu and Yifang leap down, freeing Nie Mudan while Madam Nie is still undecided on her next course of action.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, what will you do, Madam Nie?&#x201D; asks Qilin. &#x201C;Would you like to continue? It may be interesting.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You really do take after me,&#x201D; sighs the mistress of Huashan. &#x201C;Tian&#x2019;er, it is time to go. I would not waste anymore of this night on them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It looks like you like to have your women bail you out, Xu Jing,&#x201D; says Bai Jiutian. She appears to be unruffled by their sudden appearance and the prospect of an imminent fight; in fact, she looks quietly confident. Yunzi lands by your side, eager to confront Bai, but the Huashan disciple points her sword at your motley crew. A menacing killing intent radiates from her, as does a wave of powerful <i>qi</i>: if you attack now, regardless of your advantage in numbers, there will be bloodshed. Neither Madam Nie nor Bai Jiutian will hold back&#x2026; and faced with Bai&#x2019;s killing intent, you get a sudden vision of yourself covered in blood. Blood that is not yours. Helpless. Your helpless self, unable to keep the girls safe.<br>
<br>
You make your decision. &#x201C;This is not the time,&#x201D; you mutter, holding Yunzi back. If they are willing to retreat and leave the twins in your care, your objective is accomplished. Of course, what comes after will be a problem, but you will deal with that when the time comes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A wise choice,&#x201D; smiles Madam Nie. With a wave of her hand, the darkness seems to encroach upon both her and Bai Jiutian. They back away and are soon swallowed up, and in the next second they are no longer anywhere to be seen.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, you cannot go a single year without bringing home new women, can you?&#x201D; Xuezi looks at Shuixian and Mudan, taking time off from snacking on some <i>mantou</i> to make her comment. The twins look rather uncomfortable to be in your room, surrounded by the other girls. Qilin is pacing around them with a predatory look on her face; as they are her half-stepsisters of a sort, you wonder what she thinks of the twins.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As expected of the greatest pervert and womanizer in history,&#x201D; says Yunzi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well, he <i>did </i>try to go after my own mother,&#x201D; laughs Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How disgusting.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Jing&#x2026; did it <i>because</i> it was disgusting&#x2026; right?&#x201D; smiles Cao&#x2019;er strangely.<br>
<br>
You shake your head firmly and wordlessly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Anyway, knowing that woman, we might not have much more time before Nie Wuxing comes looking for his daughters. I would not be surprised if he is knocking at our door any time now,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;What do we do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do <i>you </i>want to do?&#x201D; You direct your question at the twins. &#x201C;I had you run so that you could have time to think, and so that Madam Nie would not control the whole situation. If you want to go back to your father&#x2019;s side&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We want to make him realize that he is wrong about what he is doing,&#x201D; says Shuixian firmly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t really know how to do that, however,&#x201D; her sister admits, a second later.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There are three paths for you that I can think of,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;Firstly, you can denounce your mother&#x2019;s misdeeds in public when your father comes for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is likely to disgrace him terribly,&#x201D; murmurs Lingshu.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is also the quickest way,&#x201D; shrugs Qilin. &#x201C;You could also return to them, be careful, and bide your time. We will try to pass everything off as a misunderstanding, and everyone gets to save face.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t that dangerous?&#x201D; asks Yifang. &#x201C;What if Madam Nie tries something again?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; nods Qilin. &#x201C;It is a risk they will have to take.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You wonder if you could try to contact Bai Jiutian and have her work out something for the twins&#x2019; safety. Even though she seems to be on the opposing side, she may be persuaded to do something about this.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve already thought about those two options,&#x201D; says Nie Mudan. &#x201C;What is the last path?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Have him take responsibility.&#x201D; Qilin points at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What?&#x201D; The question is echoed by everyone else in the room.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Y-you mean&#x2026;&#x201D; Shuixian&#x2019;s face is turning red.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, just tell your father that Xu Jing is taking all responsibility for his daughters from now on,&#x201D; says Qilin casually. &#x201C;He is likely going to be angry and throw a tantrum, but if Jing puts up a good, penitent act he should have no choice but to accept it, especially in front of everyone else. This is the only reason that will work to ensure he lets his daughters go non-violently.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This would also harm his reputation, having his daughters taken by a scoundrel of ill-repute,&#x201D; cackles Xuezi. &#x201C;A fine, scandalous play, if you can handle the consequences.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I must object to this,&#x201D; says Yunzi suddenly, frowning.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Me&#x2026; me too,&#x201D; Yifang agrees with her, nodding worriedly. &#x201C;It is just&#x2026; wrong.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; Qilin&#x2019;s eyes narrow, and she smiles sweetly. &#x201C;I suppose the added competition worries you?&#x201D; Outbursts of furious denial meet her verbal jab, and she laughs. &#x201C;Oh, don&#x2019;t think I have not overheard what you moan softly at night, while you are asleep and embraced by your dreams. I wonder what dreams they are? Should I mimic your voice? O-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;T-that&#x2019;s enough!&#x201D; Red-faced, Yunzi storms out of the room, followed by Armaiti.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And that is why chaste holy maidens are such a bother,&#x201D; grins Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tease her too much. Besides, aren&#x2019;t <i>you </i>worried about the added competition?&#x201D; you say, grinning.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, well&#x2026;&#x201D; She wraps her arms around your neck and leans in close to your ear, whispering, &#x201C;I am not too worried about <i>them</i>; they are no match for me, no? Of course, I <i>may</i> regret underestimating them in the future, but if I think it is the best choice for you at the moment, I will encourage you to make it. So, what do you think?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look at the twins. They seem confused and embarrassed; right now, their mental state is one of turmoil. It would probably not be hard to persuade them to take the course of action that you think would be best.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will persuade the twins to confront their parents when Nie inevitably comes for them. Though it will likely drag the entire ugly business out into the light, in front of the other orthodox pugilists, this has been a long time coming.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will persuade the twins to return to their parents and bide their time. In order to keep them safe from Madam Nie in the meantime, you will attempt to work something out with Bai Jiutian. With the right incentives, she is likely to cooperate.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You will publicly take responsibility for the twins, likely earning Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s undying grudge. You will have to put up a great act to ensure this does not destroy your current goodwill with some of the Eight Sects, but you do not doubt that you can pull it off.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You will not take responsibility, but will push for the twins&apos; bid for independence from their parents. As Nie will not let it go that easily, this is extremely likely to end in a duel of some sort...<br>
<br>
<b>E. </b>You should not be the one to decide; you let the twins decide what they want to do for themselves, even if they do not seem to be in the best state of mind to make that choice. You will try to support them regardless.<br>
<br>
<b>F. </b>You leave town under the cover of night, heading towards Xiangyang. You suspect that you may be able to find more clues about Madam Nie there to help the twins decide their next course of action, though Nie Wuxing will likely attempt to hunt you down till then.

            <h3>七十三 · Cold Morning</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cold Morning</span></b><br>
<br>
You did not have to wait until morning for Nie Wuxing to demand that you return the twins; in the first place, you did not expect him to sit around idly when his daughters&#x2019; chastity is at stake anyway. By the time you got around to a decision with the twins, and the business of arranging a meeting place, however, the sun had begun to rise over the river.<br>
<br>
In the early hours of dawn, Banhe Town&#x2019;s central square is deserted, the dozens of vendors that keep its nightlife thriving having closed their stalls and returned home after a good night&#x2019;s work. The only people in the chilly square at the moment are those who are about to be involved in &#x2018;a rather bothersome spot of trouble&#x2019;, as the Sword Saint put it. He did not seem too enthused about getting dragged into this matter, but Nie Wuxing had made a personal request seeking his aid as a mediator.<br>
<br>
Upon seeing you and his daughters, Nie advances, striding forth with purpose.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did he touch the both of you?&#x201D; he barks gruffly. He seems calmer than you had expected: you had come thinking that Nie&#x2019;s face would have been purple with rage. Looking past him, you catch Madam Nie gazing at you and smiling faintly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;N-no, father, nothing of the sort, but-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
Giving you a withering glance, Nie Wuxing continues, &#x201C;It is time to put an end to this foolishness and come back. I will chalk this up to the folly of youth and let things be.&#x201D; His daughters stare up at him, and you wonder if they will capitulate.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No. We will not be returning.&#x201D; Nie Shuixian is the first to reject her father&#x2019;s demand. It looks like they have decided to follow through with the plan.<br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing sighs heavily, as if he had expected such an answer all along. &#x201C;Xu Jing&#x2019;s words of poison have gotten to you, it seems. I thought you had more sense than that, Shuixian. Mudan, please do not tell me that you share your sister&#x2019;s sentiment?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nie Mudan shrinks back slightly. &#x201C;I will stay with Shuixian.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is a disgrace,&#x201D; mutters Nie. His gaze turns back to you, accusing and eager to cast blame. &#x201C;Are you going to take responsibility for them, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Me?&#x201D; You shake your head, grinning. &#x201C;Of course not!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s scowl only grows deeper at your answer. &#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D; he asks, his voice showing restraint.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your daughters have to take responsibility for themselves. Come now, Master Nie, you know that you cannot coddle them forever?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Preposterous! I will not allow you to toy with my daughters and then leave them to do as you please!&#x201D; shouts Nie, finally enraged.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He did not lay a finger on us, father!&#x201D; pleads Shuixian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; you nod. &#x201C;Not a single finger at all.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You expect me to believe that? <i>You</i>? Restraining yourself with women?&#x201D; Nie jabs his finger at the air, pointing at your chest.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I assure you, Master Nie, the stories about my prowess are highly exaggerated. You need only ask your wife.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing!&#x201D; snaps Madam Nie suddenly, &#x201C;Do not spread any more of your spurious lies. Now, what you actually mean is that you wish for our daughters to be like Miss Song of Qingcheng, do you not?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is their wish, not mine,&#x201D; you clarify, although you <i>had </i>spent time persuading them that it was the right thing to do.<br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing looks at Lingshu, and then shakes his head. It seems that he will not comment on what he thinks about her actions; it would probably be undiplomatic to speak his thoughts at this moment. Turning to his daughters instead, he warns, &#x201C;If that is what you wish... If you want to walk the <i>jianghu</i> alone, against the wishes of your family and your sect, this is tantamount to cutting all ties with us. You will be exiled. You will no longer be considered disciples of Huashan&#x2026; and I will no longer consider you my daughters.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shuixian and Mudan give each other a nervous look. Then, they nod resolutely.<br>
<br>
Nie seems taken aback by their agreement. &#x201C;Are you sure? Do not make this decision rashly,&#x201D; he says softly. They nod a second time, and he closes his eyes. &#x201C;Very well. The rules of our sect are clear.&#x201D; He raises his hand. &#x201C;Those exiled from Huashan are to be stripped of all Huashan arts, by force if necessary!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Exerting his <i>qi</i>, he brings his palm down in a powerful strike designed to cripple their meridians.<br>
<br>
The twins squeeze their eyes shut, huddling together.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is this?&#x201D; Nie Wuxing frowns, glaring at you. You have darted in front of him, blocking his palm with your fist at the last second. Behind you, you can feel the twins&#x2019; surprised stare boring into your back.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am sure there are exceptions to the rule, Master Nie. Don&#x2019;t you think you are being too mean to your daughters?&#x201D; you grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They are no longer my daughters, thanks to your lies!&#x201D; he roars.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You may talk when you put your own cowardly skin on the line to take responsibility for what you have done,&#x201D; growls Nie.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey,&#x201D; says the Sword Saint suddenly. He has remained silent and rather disinterested in the proceedings thus far, and his voice draws the attention of everyone in the square to him. &#x201C;I just realized that if you cripple your daughters here, they <i>are </i>going to die sooner or later if they want to be involved in the <i>jianghu</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is the point of a punishment,&#x201D; says Madam Nie.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, yes, I know,&#x201D; sighs Shangguan Chuji as he scratches his head with his one good hand. &#x201C;I suppose settling it with a duel is the traditional way to handle these things. You <i>do </i>know that the code dictates you fight your daughters, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nie replies reluctantly. &#x201C;Yes. If they insist on becoming independent, they cannot shy away from their obligations to the pugilistic world. I would rather that they die than disgrace themselves even further. But in this case&#x2026; this Xu Jing is the culprit behind the whole mess. He cannot be allowed to get away without answering for his deeds.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is our own decision, father,&#x201D; insists Nie Shuixian.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If there is to be a fight, I will step up to it. Xu Jing has nothing to do with this,&#x201D; adds Nie Mudan.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2026; imbecilic daughters of mine!&#x201D; splutters Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian makes a small polite cough as she steps forward. &#x201C;<i>Shifu</i>, if I may?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, what is it, Jiutian?&#x201D; grumbles Nie irritatedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Rather than a traditional duel, why not make it a test of both wits and strength?&#x201D; she suggests. &#x201C;As disciples of Huashan we pride ourselves on being well-rounded pugilists, steeped in the culture of martial arts as <i>art</i>. A brutish duel would not be a fitting way to handle this matter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you have in mind, then?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Still a duel,&#x201D; she smiles, &#x201C;but one that tests both your mind and body. It will be a mock duel where the duelists are to move according to the exact instructions of their partner, who will not be involved directly in the fight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You understand what she is getting at: this is how Master Zhang instructed you against the Castration Nuns of Emei a few years ago.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Three duelists and one tactician from each side, competing in a game of strategy, skill and understanding of martial arts. It is a training method we commonly use in Huashan,&#x201D; explains Bai.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Bai-<i>shixiong </i>is right,&#x201D; says Mudan. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve done this before.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It makes no difference&#x2026; my wayward daughters will still face their responsibility in the end.&#x201D; Stepping back, Nie Wuxing places one hand on the hilt of his Chunjun Sword. &#x201C;If you are a true man and pugilist, Xu Jing, you will face me in battle.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Just so you know, if you try to fight your way out and escape without a proper end to things, I will attempt to stop you,&#x201D; says the Sword Saint. He is looking directly at you. &#x201C;Since I have accepted this troublesome role, I will try to see it through to the end.&#x201D;<br>
<br>

<br>

            <h3>七十四 · Proxy Duel</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Proxy Duel</span></b><br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing appears to be holding nothing back. Pacing restlessly, he is talking quietly to the participants that will be under his command. He has lent his Chunjun Sword to Bai Jiutian, recruited Zhang Minyue&#x2019;s help, and Su Cheng of Taishan had volunteered his disciple&#x2019;s service quite eagerly to make up the numbers. You are facing three Great Sword wielders in this fight; on your side, you only have Song Lingshu with her newly obtained Chixiao Sword, and the hope that the Twins&#x2019; familiarity with the duel&#x2019;s style and their teamwork will be enough.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure you can do this?&#x201D; Nie Shuixian gives you an apprehensive look &#x2013; she does not seem to have much confidence in your abilities. &#x201C;You have not done anything like this before.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D; Giving her a lackadaisical grin, you say, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll make sure you and your sister get out of this mess unharmed. All you need to do is to listen to my voice alone. Nothing else matters.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;R-right.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Turning to Lingshu, you say, &#x201C;Are you ready?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She nods confidently. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be fine. Just listen to your voice, right? I can do that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good. They&#x2019;re already waiting for us, so let&#x2019;s get this over with,&#x201D; you smile.<br>
<br>
As Song Lingshu and the Twin Flowers square off against their opponents, you consider your tactics one more time. You have practiced similar exercises with Master Zhang in the past, as a drill for both defensive and offensive movements. They were done in less restrictive conditions than this fight, of course, but you are not <i>entirely </i>unfamiliar with the concept. Nie Wuxing has the major advantage of his vast experience in this match: he can make his commands more efficiently, and more quickly to boot. The speed at which you can formulate and shout out your order is going to be a vital point. Furthermore, he has the advantage of possessing three Great Swords &#x2013; of these, you have encountered the properties of the Chengying and Tai&#x2019;e swords. You are not sure how much progress Lingshu has made with the Chixiao Sword, but she is unlikely to have mastered it to any reliable extent compared to those two. Similarly, Bai Jiutian should be unfamiliar with the Chunjun Sword&#x2026; for a brief while, you wonder if that may be a weak point to exploit, but you swiftly dismiss the notion.<br>
<br>
With or without a Great Sword, she is still the greatest threat on the field.<br>
<br>
The Sword Saint signals the start of the match, and you turn your full attention to the fight in front of you. Nie Wuxing begins barking his commands swiftly, and the duelists make their move.<br>
<br>
Three steps to the left.<br>
<br>
Sea-Piercing Flying Stab.<br>
<br>
Block. Downwards slash.<br>
<br>
Waning Crescent Step.<br>
<br>
Leap over your opponent and att-<br>
<br>
No, go right to evade the oncoming stab.<br>
<br>
You try to match them move-for-move, but as expected, the Twins show a slight delay in following your orders, as they attempt to translate your commands into actual moves that they understand. Lingshu fares better, as you are able to instruct her to execute the techniques that she has learnt from you. It is a difficult fight. You find yourself focusing intensely in order to avoid falling behind. Nie Wuxing is relentless. Zhang Minyue is perhaps the weakest of the fighters there, but her Chengying Sword is difficult to predict; often you have found yourself having to withdraw your combatants in a hurry when your attention shifts from her for just an instant, leading you to misjudge that thin blade&#x2019;s reach. To your pleasant surprise, Lingshu&#x2019;s Chixiao Sword seems to be neutralizing the fearful aura of the Tai&#x2019;e Sword for now, but you are not sure if that will change. Bai Jiutian, on the other hand, is quickly proving herself to be a real nuisance. She is so self-assured of the moves to be taken that often she will have begun executing a move before Nie has even finished the sentence, and she has not made a single mistake thus far. Even with the Twins working together, you are finding it difficult to handle her attacks.<br>
<br>
You have not been sitting idle, of course. Indeed, Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s offensive strategy is powerful, and leaves you with little room to counter &#x2013; though this owes more to the quality of his duelists rather than any ingenuity of his &#x2013; but being forced to defend, too, is something that you are using to your advantage at the moment.<br>
<br>
With the technique names being called out so eagerly by Nie Wuxing,  your Wuxiang Qiankun has been slowly able to absorb and put together the moves of Huashan and Taishan that have been displayed thus far. At the same time you attune yourself to Lingshu, Shuixian and Mudan by feeling the movements of their <i>qi</i>, acting as an intermediary to meld their teamwork together more seamlessly.<br>
<br>
The match is in Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s favour thus far; you wonder if you should continue playing safe, consolidating information until you &#x2013; hopefully &#x2013; have enough to overcome your opponents in a single turn, or if you should attempt a gambit or two&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You continue ordering the girls to be on the defensive so that you can use Wuxiang Qiankun to gain an even fuller picture of your opponents&#x2019; techniques and counter them completely when the time comes.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You have the girls go on the offensive with what you have learnt thus far. This should provoke the use of more techniques from the other side, and should end the match faster. It will be far riskier, but just sitting back isn&#x2019;t your style.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You have the girls move forward quickly, running towards and past Nie Wuxing. They never defined the arena for the fight after all. Let&#x2019;s see him direct a fight when the fighters are jumping all around him.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You have the girls retreat, attempting to lure the enemy team past you. Your presence may be enough to throw them off balance, and by using yourself as a human shield you may be able to disrupt their movements.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You make full use of Wuxiang Qiankun, using the names you have learnt from Nie Wuxing to improve the technical performance of the Twins instead of having them follow your impromptu commands.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You hold back on this part: you don&#x2019;t think you need to go so far to win. Your opponents <i>may</i> find it suspicious that you are able to figure out their techniques and use it for Shuixian and Mudan so swiftly after all.

            <h3>七十五 · Forward to Xiangyang</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Forward to Xiangyang</span></b><br>
<br>
You give your order. Lingshu and the twins break away from the fight, sprinting towards Nie Wuxing. If the Master of Huashan is surprised, he does not let it show on his face. Without a second&#x2019;s hesitation, he commands his duelists to intercept. Bai Jiutian, Zhang Minyue and Liu Qi close in on the unprotected backs of the girls.<br>
<br>
A step to the left. One step backwards. Halt. Duck. Three steps to the right and jump.<br>
<br>
Giving each of the girls their instructions, you watch as they carry it out to the letter. The twins split up on both sides of their father, pirouetting away from harm and counter-attacking as you call out the Huashan technique names for their benefit. The sudden increase in their speed and skill takes both Zhang and Liu by surprise, and while Nie attempts to keep track of their movements, Song Lingshu leaps over his head, followed by Bai Jiutian.<br>
<br>
The tide has turned, and now Nie Wuxing is on the defensive.<br>
<br>
You continue calling out your orders, keeping each duelist paired up with an opponent: having lost the initiative, Nie is finding it hard to pull the combatants away to an area he can monitor easily as it gives you the opening to focus two, or even three fighters on one. Even if he tries to relocate himself, you shift the battle around him with your orders, successfully keeping him in the center of the trouble. He can only respond, and as a result with every move taken he begins falling further and further behind. You have him cornered.<br>
<br>
Then, he closes his eyes.<br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s commands become faster. Sharper. He begins to regain the lost momentum. Are you losing ground because you are suddenly wary? No, that is not the case. You realize that he is calling out his moves a mere fraction of a second after yours &#x2013; they just happen to be perfect counters, as if he is reading your mind. Nie Wuxing is using a technique that focuses solely on his hearing: from your orders, and the clash of swords, and the steps of feet, he is creating a picture of the battlefield in his mind. Wuxiang Qiankun allows you to understand this: if the two of you were perfectly, evenly matched, this could only be a defensive, reactionary tactic. He would only be able to respond to the orders you have already given, unable to seize the offensive. However, he has the better pieces in this duel.<br>
<br>
Slash. Zhang Minyue corners Nie Mudan with an almost imperceptible flick of her weapon.<br>
<br>
Thrust. Liu Qi gets past Nie Shuixian&#x2019;s guard, almost pushing her to the ground.<br>
<br>
You begin tapping your foot worriedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Miss Song, two steps back, then use the Golden Fangs of the White Tiger!&#x201D; you shout, as Bai Jiutian closes in on her with a predatory smile. A feint, which Bai has expected, but the follow-up comes from a different direction. With her other hand, Song Lingshu draws the hidden Yuchang Sword. Retreating two steps means that the blade passes far short of Bai: a failed attack. As Nie Wuxing calls out for Bai to press the attack, eager to clinch victory, you hurriedly get the twins to retreat from their opponents.<br>
<br>
Then, you have Lingshu dart out of the way.<br>
<br>
Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s eyes snap open as he turns to face his prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;, his instincts overriding his reason. Without hesitating, he shouts an order to stop. The point of Bai&#x2019;s blade halts just an inch before Nie&#x2019;s chest. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow as he stares down at the Chunjun Sword, gleaming brilliantly in the morning sun. &#x201C;You were confused by Man Tiger Pig, <i>shifu</i>,&#x201D; explains Bai calmly. Closing your eyes isn&#x2019;t a <i>bad </i>way to handling a confusing battle, but there is always the risk of becoming over-sensitive to unrelated sounds, like that of a tapping foot.<br>
<br>
Quickly, without giving Nie any chance to recover while he is still in shock, you have the twins dispatch their opponents. Song Lingshu circles around behind Bai Jiutian and holds up the Chixiao Sword to Bai&#x2019;s neck.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s over and done with, then,&#x201D; calls out the Sword Saint quickly, clapping his thigh. He seems to be quite eager to put a lid on the whole bothersome business. There are glares everywhere, mostly directed at you. The orthodox pugilists do not seem happy with the outcome, but their honour demands that they accept it.<br>
<br>
A while later, they discover that Pang Xiaohu and his men had gladly taken advantage of this distraction to escape.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
After all is said and done, it would be hard for you to continue travelling with Nie Wuxing and his ilk. You agreed to separate from the orthodox pugilists and make your own way. The Sword Saint and the Wudang pugilists would travel together with Nie so as to keep an eye on them. Of course, your paths led to the same city for now: Xiangyang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They are not my daughters anymore, Xu Jing, but I still hope for a modicum of decency from you when dealing with maidens,&#x201D; growls Nie Wuxing. &#x201C;Do not mistreat them.&#x201D; He is not happy at all &#x2013; losing to a rookie like you was <i>quite </i>humiliating, and his face remains stormy.<br>
<br>
Nie Shuixian and Nie Mudan bow before him. &#x201C;Father, thank you for your care all these years-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not your father anymore. Did you not hear me? You have picked your own path. What comes next in life will be of your own doing.&#x201D; Without a second look at his former daughters, Nie leads the orthodox contingent off to Xiangyang. You spot Madam Nie looking at you from within her carriage and wave. Her lips merely curl at the edges slightly as she nods.<br>
<br>
At the end of the group is Bai Jiutian, who looks down at the two girls while riding on a white horse. &#x201C;<i>Shimei</i>,&#x201D; her addresses them, though they are no longer her sect sisters, &#x201C;take care of yourselves. If you require any assistance, I am always ready to help.&#x201D; The twins bid Bai a tearful farewell, and she turns her gaze to you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You do know that your knowledge of Huashan arts has gotten certain people suspicious, do you not?&#x201D; Bai murmurs.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Does it matter?&#x201D; Your answer is non-committal. Looking at Bai Jiutian in the eye, you ask her a question: &#x201C;If your Master had not called for you to stop, would your blade have kept going?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Does it matter?&#x201D; She smiles quietly, and spurs her horse forward.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Your group arrives in Xiangyang two days later than Nie Wuxing; the wheels of your carriages came apart thrice on the way here, and on the third time the horses proceeded to vanish beyond the driver&#x2019;s ability to locate and retrieve. In the end you were forced to walk the rest of the way to the city, trudging through the mud and braving the light but endless rain. Reaching the inn dragged out a feeling of great relief in your entire party. Finally, you could rest.<br>
<br>
Lingshu and Yifang bring the Huashan twins up to their room; you had asked them to look after the girls in your stead. The twins had remained awkward around you even after the duel. Putting them under Qilin&#x2019;s care would have been like dropping two cute little mice into a snake&#x2019;s den. They are probably not ready for it.<br>
<br>
Before you can even begin to rest, however, trouble has already found you in the form of a knock at the door.<br>
<br>
When you open it, you see the youngest Wu brother &#x2013; Wu Tong &#x2013; standing in front of you with a worried look on his face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We have a message for Miss Song of Qingcheng. She is travelling with your party, right?&#x201D; he asks urgently.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Mao Sanjiao has Yao and Miecao.<br>
<br>
He has arrived in Xiangyang just yesterday, with the two elders in his care. According to him, it is finally time for justice to be done: Song Jiangke must be avenged and here is the culprit at last. To that end, he has invited Lingshu to personally handle the matter.<br>
<br>
All the while you are reading the letter, Lingshu keeps her eyes averted from Cao&#x2019;er and Yifang.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why is Grandmother dragged into this?&#x201D; blurts out Yifang when you finish. &#x201C;Mao Sanjiao is going to make an enemy of Emei by doing this!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is probably why he has come to meet Master Nie of Huashan,&#x201D; says Wu Tong. &#x201C;As the leader of the orthodox sects, he has the power and right to arbitrate the matter. If he handles this properly, Emei would have less complaints.&#x201D; He must have been in correspondence with Nie to know that he would be passing through Xiangyang at this time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, that is not all,&#x201D; says Qilin. &#x201C;She is serving as a hostage.&#x201D; It looks like Mao knows about Yao&#x2019;s granddaughters travelling with you; though your name was not mentioned, the message warned against rash action. Miecao would also be a guarantee for Yao&#x2019;s good behaviour; you would not rule out the old man being insane enough to bring down the whole of Qingcheng with some crazy suicide pill if he was forced to, but if he had others to consider, that would stay his hand. Wasn&#x2019;t Shun keeping an eye on them? What happened?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;Jing&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters Cao&#x2019;er, tugging on your sleeve. You give her a comforting pat on the head, and look at Lingshu. She is biting her lower lip in worry.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hostages,&#x201D; snorts Xuezi. &#x201C;It should be trivial enough to retrieve them. What you do afterwards is more important.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is going to be a bloodthirsty suggestion, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She looks at you haughtily. &#x201C;Of course. Idiots need to be taught lessons. That is the way of the world. Kill the offenders. Wipe them out. Eradicate them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Teach them that there <i>will </i>be punishment for taking your people hostage,&#x201D; says Qilin quietly. &#x201C;That is the way of the Wudu, too.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;For once, I agree with the serpent,&#x201D; says Yunzi casually. &quot;Once they learn, they will no longer attempt such stupid acts.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re being an obedient bitch,&#x201D; smiles Qilin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are you going to do?&#x201D; You direct a question at Lingshu before things go further.<br>
<br>
Her answer is short, uncertain. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D; She turns away and leaves the room &#x2013; she probably needs to think on her own. Hearing the other girls talk about killing fellow Qingcheng members did not sit well with her, you think.<br>
<br>
Sighing, you lean back. &#x201C;Armaiti.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, my lord?&#x201D; She responds to the authority in your voice instinctively.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Vairya and Ameretat should already be here. Locate them as soon as you can.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She bows, acknowledging your order, and leaves the room.<br>
<br>
The meeting to judge Yao happens tomorrow, at the gates of the Black Dragon Society. Mao claims to have purchased their services to ensure everyone&#x2019;s safety on neutral ground. There is no other choice: they are the dominant pugilistic institution in Xiangyang, orthodox or not, and at least they are known to follow the money rather than perverse ideals. All of this sounds like attempts at rationalization to you, but you suppose the orthodox can believe whatever they want.<br>
<br>
At the same time, through some strange twist of fate, You&#x2019;s beggar faction had sought refuge with the mercenaries. If there is a confrontation tomorrow, this will create a chance for Qi Liuwu to draw his enemy out and end the beggar civil war once and for all. There are also stories that Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai have been captured in an attempt to rescue their children. To top it all off, Nie Wuxing and the orthodox pugilists will be present, and you have heard from the twins that the Black Dragon Society may have been supplying criminals and slaves to Madam Nie for experimentation.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow would be a busy day.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You attend the meeting where the orthodox pugilists are going to judge Yao and Miecao. You want to be there in case anything happens; if need be, you will retake them by force.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You infiltrate the Black Dragon Society while their attentions are occupied with the going-ons elsewhere and attempt to find Zuo and his wife, at the same time investigating for clues on their links to Huashan.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You assist Qi Liuwu to finally retake control of the Beggars&#x2019; Sect. One fight at a time: you can plan your battles more easily if the beggars are on your side.

            <h3>七十六 · Ghosts of the Butterfly</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ghosts of the Butterfly</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Infiltrating a mercenary&#x2019;s fortress as our first mission together, my dear Lord Jing. How thrilling!&#x201D; Ameretat is practically bouncing with cheer as her feet hit the ground just behind you. &#x201C;In broad daylight, at that!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You look around at the empty courtyard. &#x201C;The beggars are drawing every eye in the fort, daylight or not.&#x201D; Just outside of the walls of the Black Dragon Society was a small army of smelly homeless people led by Qi Liuwu and Jiu Mou. They are currently harrasing the guards at the back gate with projectiles of rotten vegetables and weeks-old moldy rice, as well as the finest selection of excrement. Even from here you can hear their chants: to bring out the traitor beggars so that they can settle the issue once and for all. At the front gate, on the other hand, the Killer Physician is being held by the orthodox sects.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure you do not need to be there?&#x201D; asks Yunzi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It should be fine. I asked Master Shangguan if he would be willing to help monitor Master Yao&#x2019;s situation, and he agreed to keep matters as peaceful as possible,&#x201D; you say quietly, walking up to the guarded prison doors &#x2013; Zuo and his wife are most likely being held in there.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not what I meant. I was more concerned for Miss Song,&#x201D; she replies. &#x201C;I thought she would be more in need of your support at this moment.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She has to decide on her own. It&#x2019;s not my call to make.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;For all the work your tongue does, you really do not understand the heart of women,&#x201D; sighs Qilin, her eyebrows arched as if in disbelief at your denseness.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not my call to make,&#x201D; you repeat, slamming the guard&#x2019;s head into the wall with your fist  before he finishes calling out. He crumples, laid out cold by the blow.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Regardless, we should hurry.&#x201D; Yunzi&#x2019;s whip curls around the neck of the other guard and tightens, causing his face to develop a light blue tint as he makes choking, spluttering noises.<br>
<br>
Ameretat runs her dexterous fingers across the guard&#x2019;s body, delving into his robes before fishing out a ring of keys. She grins, and unlocks the dragon-head padlock securing the doors. She stands aside and bows, saying, &#x201C;After you, Lord Jing, Holy Maiden.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The floor slopes down sharply once you enter the building. It looks like the bulk of the prison is dug into the earth. You encounter no resistance; the only prison guards are the ones you put down outside, it seems. Wooden bars stained black by age serve to separate the dozens of small cells down here. Each cell is occupied by at least two or three prisoners in rags, manacled to the dirty ground. The flickering, dim torches do nothing to help you identify them from a distance, and as you pass by, you notice that the most disquieting thing about this prison is the comparative silence. You have visited a few jails in the capital with Shun, and they were <i>always</i> filled with people crying out their innocence and seeking help. Here, the only noise that the prisoners make are a shallow breathing and the occasional low moan that tells you they are still alive. In addition to the thick stink of human waste that is usually found in poorly maintained prisons, you can pick up the smell of rotting flesh &#x2013; the stench is faint, but it is there. Whether it is human or not, you do not know.<br>
<br>
The girls with you are hushed by the strange atmosphere. You can feel them crowding around you closer and closer, the further you travel into the prison&#x2019;s depths. &#x201C;You too?&#x201D; you groan at Ameretat. She is practically pushing her &#x2013; admittedly soft and enjoyable &#x2013; body up against your back as if she hopes to meld together. Ameretat only gives you an embarrassed laugh at your rebuke&#x2026; and you are not so sure if her embarrassment is real.<br>
<br>
At the end of the prison you find the people you are looking for.<br>
<br>
Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai are chained to the earthen walls of their cell. Iron vests, similar to the one you once saw on Yang Xue, are clapped around their torsos and pierced by long needles.  You open the cell door to take a closer look. The couple&#x2019;s eyes are closed &#x2013; you wonder if they are asleep. You take a further step inside, your foot crushing the dry straw underneath.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; A hissed warning causes you to halt. You look down; a young boy is crouched on the ground, his back against the wall. His presence is so weak that you had almost missed him in the dark. A girl of the same age is shivering in his arms. These must be Zuo&#x2019;s children. They have manacles around their feet; did the Hei brothers gain a sliver of conscience and put the entire family together in the same cell?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am a friend of your parents,&#x201D; you say, trying to convince the boy.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. Get away before they wake up,&#x201D; he whispers urgently. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s almost time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Time for wh-&#x201C; Your question is answered before you can finish it.<br>
<br>
A quiet, almost imperceptible ring in the air sounds out, and trailing behind it a cacophony rises.<br>
<br>
Like a wave sweeping in from the outside, the babbling grows louder and louder as it travels down the prison&#x2019;s hallway: the prisoners are screaming.<br>
<br>
Zuo Qingfeng&#x2019;s eyes snap open, and so does You Lanhai, next to him. The whites of their eyes are almost entirely a purplish-black, with only a dull gleam reflecting the flames of the torches. They stare at you unblinkingly, but make no noise or movement. Qilin and Yunzi squeak in surprise, clinging onto you from both sides.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That drug,&#x201D; mutters Qilin. &#x201C;The one they used on Fu Xia.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait, do you know what is going on, big sister?&#x201D; plead the boy suddenly. &#x201C;Can you help my parents?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Qilin&#x2019;s answer is drowned out by a nearby scream. Zuo and wife shriek and attempt to lunge at their children. The girl cries out, and the both of them withdraw as far as their chains will allow them. Zuo roars and struggles, full of hostile intent. The metal binding him jerks and creaks alarmingly, but for now they hold.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If it is a drug, there may be an antidote,&#x201D; theorizes Ameretat. &#x201C;Who would be likely to have it in this place?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Hei brothers. They run the Black Dragon Society,&#x201D; you say. You do not have any idea where they would be, however: they could be with the orthodox masters, or confronting the beggars. They might also be resting with their nubile young slaves in the audience hall.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the entire jail shakes. Dust and loose earth fall from above &#x2013; a tremor from above ground. And in the distance, you briefly sense the presence of a powerful <i>qi</i>. Something has happened.<br>
<br>
Then, the metal chains let out a long, drawn out screech as they finally come loose from the wall. Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai are free. The chains dangle loosely from their wrists as they stare at their children, and then at you. They scream, as one. Moving far faster than you expected, Zuo Qingfeng, closes in and begins attacking. You are caught of guard; you evade the first two punches but are forced to block the third, and when it lands it hits with such force that it blows you backwards a good distance, crashing through the wooden cell bars. Qilin, Yunzi and Ameretat are fending off You Lanhai, who appears to be attempting to get at the children, but you can tell that they cannot hold her off for long. The swordswoman appears to have gained immense strength and speed far beyond any human &#x2013; well, normal human &#x2013; as has her husband, and without fighting seriously they cannot hope to win.<br>
<br>
Zuo Qingfeng seems to lose interest in you the moment you are knocked away, and tries to dart around the girls to reach the children. Yunzi reacts swiftly enough to block his path, but he lets out a cry of rage and unleashes a <i>qi </i>attack that blasts her into the wall.<br>
<br>
All around you, the once silent prisoners are hollering and slamming on the bars of their cells, seemingly caught in the same frenzy that afflicts Zuo and You; whatever caused that tremor, it also seems to have weakened their bonds. You will have to decide what to do quickly.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You attempt to subdue the couple peacefully, even if it puts you and the others at risk thanks to the difficulty of the battle. You cannot reach the pressure points through the iron vests that they wear, but if you reposition the needles already present, there is a possibility that you can shut down the berserking pair. You can then retreat with them in tow and search for the Hei brothers.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You cannot risk the time and effort required to subdue the couple without killing them. It is a pity, but you will have to put them down. It is the quickest way to bring them peace: there is no guarantee that there <i>is </i>an antidote, and that you can keep them, their children, or yourself safe while you search for it. Something unexpected may be happening outside and this particular problem needs to be solved quickly.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You break the chains of the children, grab them and make a run for it. Sure, it might mean unloosing a swarm of madmen outside, and having Zuo and You close on  your tail, but you&#x2019;ll think about that later.  For now, escaping the prison safe and sound together with the kids is your greatest priority.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>Zuo and You&#x2019;s focus on their children might mean they are not all gone. Perhaps the power of familial love may yet save them: you allow them to come into contact with their children and hope for the best.

            <h3>七十七 · Black Dragon Pyre</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Black Dragon Pyre</span></b><br>
<br>
Despite their increased speed and strength, you can just about handle the couple by attempting to play it safe. Employing Qilin and Yunzi as distractions, you work together with Ameretat to reseal their <i>qi</i>, plucking out the needles whenever you see an opportunity and slotting them back in the positions that she calls out. It is at times such as this that you thank Master Yao for drilling the names of the pressure points into your head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Three needles more left to go,&#x201D; you call out to Qilin and Yunzi, dancing around Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai to the best of their ability &#x2013; at this level of combat, if they get tagged even once it would mean serious injury. Ameretat joins in to support them, fighting in a strange and exotic manner &#x2013; she remains mostly rooted to the ground, relying on interesting, agile contortions of her body to reach and hit the enemy.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;D-don&#x2019;t talk to us right now!&#x201D; screams Qilin, ducking under a powerful lunge that carves a furrow through the rock.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care if there&#x2019;s three or two or one, just get them in quickly!&#x201D; shouts Yunzi as she leads Zuo Qingfeng towards you. At the last minute, she rolls out of the way just as Ameretat withdraws and tells you what to do. You dart to Zuo&#x2019;s side, plucking out yet another needle at the same time, and push it in where it is supposed to go. Zuo&#x2019;s movements slow imperceptibly by another step. Two more needles to go.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, your two opponents stop in their tracks. Their <i>qi </i>levels drop &#x2013; so low that they are almost imperceptible. Is it working already?<br>
<br>
The girl, their daughter, shouts out a warning.<br>
<br>
Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai move towards you, in a way that is neither fast nor slow, but akin to the ethereal dance of a dream&#x2026; a variation of the Butterfly Dream that they are renowned for. They appear to be acting more out of instinct than conscious will, and are harder to read than usual. Their palms gradually close in on you from the left and the right; no matter what steps you take, you find yourself unable to pull away or find an opening to retaliate in time.<br>
<br>
You are not able to dissect and counter this move. Not on such short notice.<br>
<br>
Taiji will not defend you.<br>
<br>
Wuxiang Qiankun cannot save you.<br>
<br>
You brace yourself for the impact, calling out for Ameretat to finish off the final needles while you take the hit.<br>
<br>
The blow does not land.<br>
<br>
Qilin intercepts Zuo Qingfeng on your left. Yunzi blocks You Lanhai on your right.<br>
<br>
Every cell door in the prison shatters, torn to pieces by the force of the technique blasting outwards. Qilin and Yunzi are hurled far off into the darkness, taking the brunt of the move, while you are driven to your knees. Thanks to the drug, their internal strength has been improved drastically &#x2013; you are not sure if you would have still been able to stand attempting to take that move by yourself.<br>
<br>
At the same time, dark blood spills from the couple&#x2019;s mouths and noses, the thick liquid almost black in the dim torchlight. Using such a powerful move is not without its drawbacks, it seems. Ameretat swiftly puts the last needles into position, causing the two to crumple up and sink to the floor. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re alive,&#x201D; she says, but you do not have the time to listen &#x2013; you are already scrambling towards where Qilin and Yunzi had fallen.<br>
<br>
You reach their collapsed forms, darting past the shrieking prisoners struggling against their weakening chains. Your heart skipping a beat, you turn them over. There is a pulse. There is warmth. You cannot help but heave a sigh of relief.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;internal injuries&#x2026;&#x201D; murmurs Qilin, still dazed from the blow. Yunzi is silent, but her eyes are open and she shakes her head. The two of them don&#x2019;t seem to be in any condition to move.<br>
<br>
Then, the first sounds of snapping metal are heard.<br>
<br>
The prisoners are free.<br>
<br>
A babbling madwoman leaps at your back, but with a single, powerful sweep, you execute the Divine Dragon Sweeps Its Tail, using your palm stance to smash her into the walls. Keeping Qilin and Yunzi near your feet, you take a defensive posture. You must have broken several bones in her body, yet the prisoner manages to crawl to her feet, staring at you with some sort of deep hatred that you are sure &#x2013; well, almost sure &#x2013; that you did nothing to deserve. With a bone-chilling howl, she comes at you again, and this time you put her down for good.<br>
<br>
Ameretat comes up to you, dragging two limp bodies with her; the husband and wife are out of it and definitely will be so for the forseeable future. She pants from the effort, dropping them to the ground unceremoniously. She stares at your bloodied arms, and at the dismembered corpse lying some feet away, before smiling at you. &#x201C;How&#x2026; thrilling. But we have no time for this sort of play, Lord Jing. What should we do now? I cannot carry all of them by myself, being the weak woman that I am.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The two children, having been freed from their chains, are clutching tightly onto each other while looking at the mayhem around them in fear &#x2013; having been freed, the first thing that the prisoners did was to set upon the closest thing they could see.<br>
<br>
In most of the cases, their target was each other.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It will not be hard to sneak past them in this situation. We just have to be careful and move slowly to avoid attracting their attention,&#x201D; you say. The children will need to be escorted, but if you move together with Ameretat that should not be a problem.<br>
<br>
You bend down to try and pick up both Qilin and Yunzi, and they yelp in pain &#x2013; in such a position, with their weight added to yours, the only way you can fight will be with your feet, and you would not be able to perform too much stunts lest you aggravate their injuries.<br>
<br>
The door at the top of the prison is thrown open, and the smell of smoke wafts in.<br>
<br>
Something is burning outside.<br>
<br>
You can see the figure of a man silhouetted against the light of the sun. &#x201C;There is no end to our troubles today,&#x201D; he growls, &#x201C;and here I find some rats in the dungeon making a mess of things. I really do not have time for this right now!&#x201D; You recognize him &#x2013; it is Hei Youlong, the younger and more martial-minded of the two brothers. He raises his fingers to his lips and whistles. The high-pitched tone rings throughout the prison, causing the prisoners to fall silent.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Kill them,&#x201D; he orders, and he slams the door shut before you can engage in any witty repartee.<br>
<br>
The prisoners rush you all at once.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201D; mutters Qilin as blood bubbles through her lips. &#x201C;Leave me. I can manage to hide by myself... I still have a trick or two up my sleeve.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, that&#x2019;s stupid,&#x201D; says Yunzi weakly as she tries to stand. &#x201C;I&#x2026; I can still fight. You should get out first.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>In this situation, with all of the prisoners focused on you, it is impossible for you to get out with both Yunzi and Qilin. Ameretat will not be able to bring out both Zuo and his wife while escorting the children at the same time either. You will have to choose.<br>
(<i>Pick two</i>)<br>
<b>I.</b> Chi Qilin<br>
<b>II. </b>Yunzi<br>
<b>III.</b> Zuo Qingfeng<br>
<b>IV.</b> You Lanhai<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will try to draw every prisoner&#x2019;s attention to you. While you are fighting them, Ameretat and the others can crawl or squirm or do whatever they need to get to the door safely. The sheer weight of the enemy&#x2019;s numbers will make it hard for you to break through by yourself afterwards, however.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You attempt to imitate the high-pitched whistle that Hei Youlong used. It might work. It might not. It might work in ways that you didn&#x2019;t expect. It&#x2019;s a gamble, but you&#x2019;re all about gambles, aren&apos;t you?

            <h3>七十八 · Black Dragon Pyre II</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Black Dragon Pyre II</span></b><br>
<br>
There is no other choice. You will have to risk it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll draw their attention. Handle the rest,&#x201D; you order.<br>
<br>
Ameretat gives you a dainty curtsey. &#x201C;Aye aye, Lord Jing. As you command.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You concentrate your <i>qi</i>, and with a wave of your palm, you snuff out the nearby torches, dropping your immediate surroundings into a deeper gloom. The maddened prisoners pause, sniffing the air uncertainly. While Ameretat keeps the others crouched down and quiet on the floor, you make the first move.<br>
<br>
Charging in, you throw a single blow from your fist that hurls one of the prisoners back. He slams against the wall hard, to the tune of a dozen cracked bones, and that seems to be the cue for the battle to begin.<br>
<br>
The prisoners beset you from all sides, falling upon you like a pack of dogs on prey. Their moves are not mindless and actually seem to be sharper than before; here and there you notice flashes of technique and glimpses of skill. The command given by Hei Youlong seems to have given their aggression a target; coupled with their heightened physical abilities, you do not expect to walk away without a scratch.<br>
<br>
Hands grab at you as you whirl around, lashing out with no particular target in mind. Reacting just in the nick of time, you narrowly block a powerful kick that sends a shudder up your shoulder and almost drives you to the ground. You throw off your assailant and slam him into the earth but yet more come, shrouded in the darkness. In the distance, you hear the door opening, allowing light to peek into the dungeon.<br>
<br>
They&#x2019;ve made it out; that did not take long.<br>
<br>
Immediately, you grab hold of the prisoners nearest to you. Gathering <i>qi </i>into your abdomen, you let out a forceful shout that causes the earth itself to tremble. Dirt tumbles from above, the earthen ceiling shaken loose by your roar. The prisoners are blown away like leaves in the wind. They break themselves upon the walls of the dungeon, the stone showing their bodies no mercy.<br>
<br>
Seeing an opening in front of you, you take it. There is no point being mired in a battle with these people.<br>
<br>
You run for the door, which had swung shut again.<br>
<br>
Before you reach it, a shriek from over your shoulder tells you quite insistently that you must evade.<br>
<br>
You do so.<br>
<br>
A bloodied prisoner flies past you, arms outstretched. He lands on all fours, crouched like a beast. As he snarls angrily, his companions encircle you, cutting off your path of retreat again. The crowd grows in number as the survivors begin to recover from the effects of your roar; though most of them are bleeding from their eyes and ears, their persistence is unabated. There are perhaps sixty of them approaching you, and there could be even more lurking in the thick darkness.<br>
<br>
You cast a quick glance around you, weighing your chances. Your roar had blown out most of the remaining torches, but you should be able to fight in the dark.<br>
<br>
Still&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Subdue all of them by attacking their pressure points, like you did with Zuo Qingfeng and You Lanhai? You do not think you can do it in such an environment; the situation seems perilous enough as it is. The alternative would be to seek a more permanent solution. It looks like the prisoners are going to force your hand, though that is no fault of theirs &#x2013; the fault lies with the people who made them this way.<br>
<br>
You sigh.<br>
<br>
The prisoner leaps at you, baring his teeth and spinning around in the air in some strange, bestial technique.<br>
<br>
There is but the barest whisper of steel, and he lands behind you, staggering. His head touches the ground half a second later. You flick the wodao downwards, causing the blood coating the sword to spatter across the ground in dark patches.<br>
<br>
The prisoners launch their attack, howling in rage.<br>
<br>
Thrusting forward, you pierce the heart of one prisoner in a single strike, before twisting the sword and wrenching it upwards. The blade passes through his throat, and then his jaw, and his skull. Shifting your footing, you slash behind you in a circular motion, at a prisoner attempting to claw your back off. The fine edge of the blade parts flesh and cleaves bone with ease under the guidance of your &#x2013; well, the Sword Saint&#x2019;s &#x2013; hand, and your target&#x2019;s torso falls apart even before you complete your swing. You cut, and cut, and cut; there is little room for finesse in your footwork here. As the bodies fall, you leap deeper into the army of maniacs, executing the Fiery Flight of the Vermillion Pheasant. Here you take off an arm, there you remove a head. Six slashes; ten dead. With every slice of the wodao, you add a stroke to the bloody landscape being painted in the darkness.<br>
<br>
Your sword arm twinges slightly &#x2013; just slightly &#x2013; and your next slash is stopped by a sturdy spine, the blade of the wodao lodging deep but not cutting cleanly. Your opponent, madly unperturbed by the sword that has embedded itself halfway into his torso, grabs your arm with both his hands. His grip is strong: strong enough to break bones. You slam your free hand into his temple; your claws dig into his skull and the force of your swing tears the head clean off the body. Still, by stopping your movement for just a second, the opportunity has been created&#x2026; and the horde takes it.<br>
<br>
They fall upon you savagely, punching, clawing, kicking, biting. You feel their blows assailing every bit of you from all sides. Your eye-patch is ripped off, the wodao is knocked from your grip, and their fingers attempt to squirm under your skin to tear at your flesh. A hundred wounds are opened up all over your body. You do not want to take this risk, but you have no choice: breathing in as much as you can, you let out a second roar. The prisoners are blasted back by the pressure of your <i>qi </i>shout, and the dungeon is shaken yet again. This time rocks fall, and for an instant you wonder if everybody down here is going to die.<br>
<br>
Thankfully, the tremors stop short of burying you in soil and stone. With your last move, however, you have blown out any last bit of light from the torches still remaining, plunging yourself into complete darkness. Strangely enough, despite the absence of any light whatsoever, you can see faint, flickering fires ahead of you seemingly outlining the shaken prisoners in the dark. You raise a hand to your empty eye socket, where the smallest spark of the Holy Flame resides: does it have anything to do with this?<br>
<br>
There is no time to ponder this too long: even without sight, the prisoners&#x2019; imperative remains unchanged. You are still a target &#x2013; they must be tracking you through sound or smell.<br>
<br>
The first attacks come. In your current state, you cannot achieve enough concentration to perform Taiji Fist &#x2013; you will just have to power through with all of your might. Sometimes, to defend, you must attack.<br>
<br>
You meet their fists with your claws; the first prisoner to reach you &#x2013; and the one immediately behind her &#x2013; is torn apart from a single, brutal swing with the Raging Claws of the Mad Lion. You leap over their twitching bodies and strike downwards into the horde, your fingers rending flesh and leaving behind jagged, bloody furrows wherever they pass. You grab the collarbone of another opponent, crushing it under your grip; then, with a loud yell, you drive the side of your palm right into his torso in the form of The Submerged Dragon Left Behind. The center of his chest caves in, and even as he crumples in a messy heap, you turn around and unleash The Lone Dragon Battles in the Wilderness with both palms, sending a powerful torrent of chaotic <i>qi </i>surging forth. The numerous bodies hit by your attack are flung into the air; the very blood is squeezed from their pores, spraying out and forming a fine mist in the air.<br>
<br>
Still you are not done yet. There seems to be no end to the enemies in front of you. They charge at you unerringly, more and more of them clambering out from behind boulders and mounds of earth.<br>
<br>
You breathe in deeply, clenching your fists.<br>
<br>
You cannot risk using the roar a third time now&#x2026; but no matter what, you are getting out of here alive.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You push at the door with your aching fingers &#x2013; the tips are split open from ripping through so much flesh and bone. Leaving behind bloodstained streaks on the door&#x2019;s surface, you stagger past the threshold and into the burning light of the sun.<br>
<br>
The entire fortress is on fire, swallowed by hungry red flames.<br>
<br>
You move, dragging your feet in exhaustion. You are a bloody mess at the moment &#x2013; granted, most of the blood is not yours, but the battle has left you drained. You had fought until there was no one else left standing; you do not know how many prisoners are left alive, if any. What matters is that you have managed to walk out alive. Your tiredness and minor wounds will be nothing a few days of good rest cannot solve.<br>
<br>
There are shouts and sounds of battle coming from a distance, but you do not recognize any of the voices, nor do you see any of your companions at the moment.<br>
<br>
Without realizing it, you find yourself having wandered in front of the main building. Here, as with everywhere else, flames have bloomed all over the walls. You remember your initial reason for attempting to sneak in: to rescue Zuo and his family, and to find evidence of the Black Dragon Society&#x2019;s misdeeds. The first objective is accomplished, and perhaps here you can complete the second.<br>
<br>
The interior of the building is deserted. Well, of any one living, to be exact. You look down at the bodies littering the hall. They are all Black Dragon fighters; with the fire gradually increasing in intensity you do not have time to investigate the bodies further, but from what you can see, they have been killed with a single blow that crushed their skulls. Whoever did this must have been a martial artist of great strength.<br>
<br>
You make your way upwards, and as you climb the stairs the bodies that you find appear to be in worse and worse condition; some are ripped apart and others reduced to mere husks.<br>
<br>
As you reach the top, you glimpse a strange sight:<br>
<br>
A cloaked man, swaddled in dirty rags, smashing the wooden windows open and leaping out of it.<br>
<br>
You rush to the window, though by the time you get there the man is nowhere to be found.<br>
<br>
A low groan from within a nearby room attracts your attention. You enter; perhaps there is a single survivor after all.<br>
<br>
Who you find is Hei Zuolong, the elder of the Hei brothers. He is sprawled flat, blood soaking his fine clothes from a wound in his back. His limbs are trembling as he forces himself off the floor, croaking, &#x201C;Help&#x2026; help me&#x2026;&#x201D; He does not seem to recognize you; his gaze is focused on something behind you. You turn around. There is nothing there.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That bastard&#x2026; he&#x2026; I&#x2026; drugged&#x2026; antidote. Quick&#x2026; before I go mad&#x2026;&#x201D; he moans. Hei coughs, and a thick, dark liquid spills from the corners of his mouth.<br>
<br>
It is probably the very same potion that was used on the prisoners that you slaughtered.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Where is it?&#x201D; you ask.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shelf&#x2026; third from the right&#x2026; Hurry!&#x201D; he screams.<br>
<br>
It does not take you long to find it. There does not seem to be a lot; it is only enough for a single person. You hold the little bottle in your hand, looking down at Hei Zuolong.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W&#x2026;what are you waiting for?&#x201D; he shouts again, hammering at the wooden floor with his fists even as the fire rages all around him. Even with his injury, the planks creak under the force of his blows.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>A trade of favours: You offer to trade him the antidote in return for everything he can tell you about his dealings with this dangerous drug. He is the last source of information in the Black Dragon Society you can tap; the fire has likely turned any other paper evidence to ashes. He will answer for his crimes after that, in a court of law. That is the proper way to do things.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You offer to trade him the antidote &#x2013; and only the antidote &#x2013; for information. After that&#x2026; well, you did not exactly make any promise to spare his life, after all. Bringing this to the courts is only a waste of time. As Shun&#x2019;s agent, you do not see why you cannot execute immediate justice when the verdict is clear.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You would prefer to keep the antidote for Cao&#x2019;er to study it, so that you can produce enough to save Zuo and his wife. Hei Zuolong would not be able to tell you how to make the antidote; if he did, the sneaky weasel already would have more on hand rather than this small, measly amount. You will do him the favour of putting him out of his misery, however.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You will keep the antidote &#x2013; you need it. As for Hei Zuolong, you will leave him to his fate. It is not for you to decide what happens to him next. Live, go mad, or die; whatever comes is of his own doing... his own karma.

            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Black Dragon Pyre III</span></b><br>
<br>
You toss the bottle lightly and catch it, repeatedly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Am I to think that you are proposing a trade of favours, hm?&#x201D; you ask, leaning against a half-smouldering desk.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, yes! A trade! Of favours, whatever you want! It is yours!&#x201D; shouts Hei Zuolong, his throat growing hoarse.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not worry. I will make this quick,&#x201D; you murmur softly. You reach out with one hand, and before he can understand what is going on, your grip closes around his neck. His mouth gapes open, as if to suck in the antidote currently nestling in your palm. &#x201C;Unfortunately, Brother Hei, your initial judgment was right. I am not a very <i>reliable </i>person. It would be mean of me to get your hopes up, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201D; You shake your head sadly, and tuck the antidote away in your blood-stained clothes with your free hand.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2026; <i>you</i>!&#x201D; Finally, the light of recognition dawns through his drug-hazed mind. Hei Zuolong glares at you, breathing heavily. &#x201C;Man&#x2026; Tiger&#x2026; Pig&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Your fingers tighten, and twist, and then it is done.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You leave the main building of the Black Dragon Society behind, allowing it to become a fiery tomb for the corpses that lay within. It may not last, however. The sky above you is darkening, and the rumbling of thunder can be heard rolling in from the distance. You have to meet up with your companions quickly; your first priority should be the gates, where the orthodox pugilists had been trying Master Yao for his role in the death of Song Jiangke. Climbing up the nearest wall for a better vantage point, you walk along it, noting the dead in the courtyard as you go along. Beggars and mercenaries alike lay dead; though to your relief, you do not see any familiar faces.<br>
<br>
It does not take you long to find what you are looking for. As you expected, they are still at the gates. You hop up onto the low earthen parapet, surveying the scene below you.<br>
<br>
You spot Cao&#x2019;er instantly: she is tending to Qilin and Yunzi together with Master Yao, Armaiti and Ameretat. Yifang is with Miecao, supporting her grandmother. Xuezi is sitting on her own, looking somewhat disinterested. Mudan and Shuixian are looking on concernedly, their faces pale with worry.<br>
<br>
Lingshu is in the Qingcheng camp&#x2026; it looks like she has made her choice.<br>
<br>
Qi Liuwu and Jiu Mou are off to one side, standing guard over their captured foes, Beggar Chief You amongst them &#x2013; or is that <i>former </i>Beggar Chief at the moment?<br>
<br>
You can see the orthodox pugilists gathered; Madam Nie, Bai Jiutian, Guo Fu, Liu Qi, Su Liaojing &#x2013; all of them are here. The Sword Saint and his disciple are not present, however &#x2013; you find that a bit surprising.<br>
<br>
A few surviving bands of Black Dragon mercenaries have gathered here, looking confused and tired. They number about four dozen, all armed and armoured with nowhere to go.<br>
<br>
Then there is Vairya, surrounded by Nie Wuxing, Liu Ye, Su Cheng and Mao Sanjiao: four Masters of the Eight Orthodox Sects. All of them have their weapons out... from the torn-up condition of the ground around them, they have already exchanged a few moves in battle. Vairya seems uninjured, and entirely unconcerned; there is a slight grin on his lips. He turns, looking up directly at you. For some reason unknown to you, he drops to one knee at the sight of you. Lightning flashes overhead, followed by a peal of thunder; and subsequently what the collective crowd happens to see is the Fire Cult&#x2019;s Guardian of Metal kneeling to a bloody spectre dramatically silhouetted by a flash from the heavens.<br>
<br>
Well, this is not going to be good for your reputation.<br>
<br>
There is no point staying up here; the wind is whipping up and it is starting to feel chilly. The dried blood is getting uncomfortable, sticking to your skin. Taking in a deep breath, you gauge the distance &#x2013; you hope you don&#x2019;t botch the landing and fall flat on your face.<br>
<br>
You jump.<br>
<br>
Your <i>qinggong </i>carries you clear of the walls, and you glide down seemingly effortlessly to land near Cao&#x2019;er. Upon seeing you, she immediately abandons Qilin and Yunzi&#x2019;s treatment to rush to your side. She begins fussing over you, running her hands over your wounds in an attempt to diagnose all of your injuries.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Yifang walks up to you, looking distinctly troubled. &#x201C;What happened to&#x2026; never mind,&#x201D; she shakes her head, and raises her arm. She is holding a sword by its scabbard, one that you recognize well &#x2013; it is the Chixiao Sword that you took from the Sword Demon. &#x201C;Lingshu is returning it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Not knowing what to do with it for now, you take it in hand and nod. You glance over at Lingshu, but she looks away, not wanting to meet your gaze. Sighing, you turn back to Yifang. &#x201C;Do you know where Shangguan Chuji and Murong Yandi are? I thought they said they would attend the trial.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yifang shakes her head. &#x201C;Master Shangguan said something about sensing a troublesome fellow coming this way. He said he&#x2019;d find a place to lay low for now.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Before you can make any comments about the Sword Saint&#x2019;s reliability, a voice rings out, calling your name.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing! Just what is the meaning of this?&#x201D; Nie Wuxing is shaking his sword angrily, while keeping a wary eye on Vairya. Vairya, on the other hand, has folded his beefy arms, his eyes shut &#x2013; he gives off the impression of a guardian statue just awaiting its master&#x2019;s order to pounce.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is no hiding it, Lord Jing,&#x201D; says Ameretat smoothly. &#x201C;Our presence has been made clear to the orthodox sects. There is no longer any need to disguise your holiness.&#x201D; Her eyes flicker up to the spark dancing in your empty socket; you had not found the time to replace the eye-patch just yet.<br>
<br>
You turn to face Nie and his allies, holding back any sign of exhaustion or pain.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Vairya, return,&#x201D; you order.<br>
<br>
With a nod of acknowledgement, he leaps to your side, covering the distance with a single bound. None of the masters attempt to stop him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not here to teach meaning, Master Nie,&#x201D; you call out, laughing. &#x201C;Even at the most enlightened temples that costs money, as you well know.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I thought it was suspicious that you were consorting with that evil fire witch,&#x201D; Nie says accusingly &#x2013; though he was the same person that approved of her presence when it seemed to suit his purpose &#x2013; and gestures at his comrades to move to a safer distance. It seems that he is not exactly looking for a fight at this point either. &#x201C;I am surprised that you would betray your country and become a commander of a foreign force!&#x201D; Already he is starting with the attempts at tarnishing your good name. You would be concerned, if you actually had a name that would suffer from being tarnished further.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>A</i> commander? <i>Shifu</i>, the Fire Temple&#x2019;s Amesha Spenta bow only to one man,&#x201D; says Bai Jiutian, breaking her silence. You glance at her; she seems to be enjoying this.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean&#x2026;&#x201D; Nie Wuxing&#x2019;s frown grows deeper. He stares at you as if you are some strange monster that just fell from the sky. &#x201C;The Fire Lord.&#x201D; A whisper of a murmur ripples through the orthodox pugilists at the mention of that title. Many of them still remember clearly the heated battle at Heihu Valley.<br>
<br>
You look behind you: if it comes down to a fight here, you may be at a disadvantage. Vairya and Ameretat are strong, but you are not sure if they can stand against the numbers of the orthodox pugilists. You have Qi Liuwu&#x2019;s support, but the beggars have already endured battle and still need to guard their traitor brethren. You do not know which way Liu Qi and Su Liaojing will swing at the moment; Guo Fu would probably help, but you do prefer that he not get himself in trouble over this.<br>
<br>
Maybe a bit of diplomacy is called for here.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why is the Fire Cult attacking the Black Dragon Society?&#x201D; asks Su Cheng suddenly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What?&#x201D; They think you did this? Though, to be fair, Vairya does look like the sort that would revel in burning down the fortress. You leave that comment unsaid and shake your head calmly. &#x201C;This is not of our doing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who else could it be? We were conducting the trial, and things were proceeding smoothly until we saw fire rising above the walls,&#x201D; says Mao Sanjiao derisively. &#x201C;Then, the beggars appeared, as did your cultists, and made a right mess of things.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It was not them, or us,&#x201D; Qi Liuwu speaks up at last. &#x201C;On our way here, we crossed paths with a cloaked man. He was highly powerful, and killed a few of our brothers before disappearing into the fortress.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I punched him into the fortress,&#x201D; muses Vairya, &#x201C;yet when I entered he was nowhere to be found. Whoever he is, he is good at hiding. I would have spent the time hunting him down, but your orders were clear, little lord. I escorted the beggars just as you wished.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We cannot trust your word, Master Qi,&#x201C; says Su Cheng, but Nie Wuxing bids him to stop talking with a wave of his hand.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The issue with the Beggar Sect is&#x2026; complex. Let us leave that matter aside for now. Now, the important thing is to-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
A sharp cry echoes through the air, followed by a raspy, mocking laugh. It is coming from the orthodox side, behind Nie Wuxing. He turns around, sword at the ready.<br>
<br>
The cloaked man is standing there, holding Liu Ye off the ground by his head. He stands slightly hunched over, but you can feel power emanating from him. One of his arms hangs by his side, wrapped tightly in cloth &#x2013; the shape of the arm looks off to you. The Kunlun master is groaning and striking at the rather more normal arm that holds him, to no avail. Su Cheng has his sword pointed at the intruder but he does not move an inch. Perhaps he fears that Liu Ye will die the moment he does.<br>
<br>
None of you had sensed his arrival; you had all been too focused on each other.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D; challenges Nie Wuxing, his eyes narrowing in suspicion.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, to try and give the credit to Man Tiger Pig for this marvelous display&#x2026; That really, <i>really</i> hurts my pride,&#x201D; the cloaked man groans, before crushing Liu Ye&#x2019;s head without any warning. There is a sickening crunch as blood and brains spurt out from between his bandaged fingers. Su Cheng falls back at this sudden display of brutality, his face growing deathly pale.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father!&#x201D; Liu Qi screams, charging in at full speed with the Tai&#x2019;e sword drawn. His rage is palpable, and it appears to drive the powers of Tai&#x2019;e &#x2013; even from here you can feel the wild aura of his <i>qi</i>, enhancing and in turn enhanced by the sword. Liu Qi&#x2019;s speed is such that it only takes him a single step to reach the cloaked man.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, stop!&#x201D; Nie Wuxing barks out a warning suddenly. &#x201C;Hold him back! That sword cannot be controlled well with pure anger!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His advice comes too late. Liu Qi&#x2019;s first swing goes way wide, missing the cloaked man as he crouches down low. With a single blow from his fist he shatters Liu Qi&#x2019;s elbow; the Tai&#x2019;e Sword spins off into the air, out of reach, as its wielder shouts in pain.<br>
<br>
The strange-looking arm tightly bound in ragged cloth draws back, preparing to deal the finishing blow.<br>
<br>
A long staff shoots forth, the end of the pole forcing the cloaked figure to leap back. Su Liaojing spins the staff in front of him, stepping in to cover the fallen Liu Qi. The counterattack comes swiftly; a single kick from the man is sufficient to disrupt Su Liaojing&#x2019;s guard. He kicks off the staff while Su is off-balance, flying into the air. Spinning around, he brings his heel down on the Kunlun disciple&#x2019;s head. You cannot help but stare.<br>
<br>
Guo Fu moves in with surprising speed, intercepting the kick with a perfect Taiji counter and hurling the cloaked man away. He lands on his feet, his heels digging into the ground. With only the briefest whisper of movement, Bai Jiutian appears behind him, a deadly look on her face. Without hesitation, without mercy, she cuts at his head.<br>
<br>
All that she slices is cloth.<br>
<br>
The cloaked man evades that attack at the last second, throwing himself flat and sliding through the dirt like a snake. He slithers a safe distance away before raising his head. His hood has fallen back, revealing a face wrapped up with bandages. Pus oozes from the open sores behind the dirty cloth. His mad eyes fix upon you, and he grins.<br>
<br>
You had hoped that you were rid of him for good.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Manxing&#x2026;&#x201D; gasps Nie Wuxing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing, Xu Jing, Xu Jing! Why are you not helping me?&#x201D; laughs Zhang Manxing. &#x201C;I know we had our differences, but that was before I found out just how <i>hypocritical </i>and <i>traitorous </i>the orthodox sects are. I&#x2019;m on your side now! Fighting your enemies! Lend me a hand, will you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you still have your dick and balls?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;I might accept you if you&#x2019;ve gotten rid of them.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Come on, what&#x2019;s a few balls between pals?&#x201D; he giggles madly and nonsensically. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t trust me, do you? Here, let me show you that I am genuine about overthrowing the Eight Sects&#x2026;&#x201D; He hops back and turns his gaze to Nie Wuxing. &#x201C;So, how&#x2019;s that Xuanming Jiuyin manual working out for you, my former master?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nie chokes and splutters. &#x201C;W-what are you talking about?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, you know what I am talking about,&#x201D; grins Zhang Manxing. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m here for that. I heard that you have the Xuanyuan Sword too. Why don&#x2019;t you show it to me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you think you can walk out of here alive, spouting such nonsense&#x2026; It will not matter if you are my former disciple or not. For attacking the Eight Sects, I will put a rabid dog such as you down with my own hands,&#x201D; declares Nie Wuxing, raising his Chunjun Sword high in the air.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; Zhang shrugs arrogantly, full of insane confidence. He spreads his arms out to his side, as if daring them to strike him down. &#x201C;<i>Some </i>of you might walk out of here alive if you just hand over that manual now. For all the sins you have committed... The older Hei was tight-lipped, but the younger spilled quite some interesting information before he died. The so-called orthodox sects are truly corrupt, along with the rest of my clan! I am ashamed that it took me so long to open my eyes!&#x201D; As he continues his rant, you wonder just how strong he has become.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Lord Jing,&#x201D; whispers Ameretat, coming close to your ear. &#x201C;This might be an emergency, and if it pleases you, I have something saved up for emergencies&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will have Vairya, Armaiti and Ameretat weigh in the battle on Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s side &#x2013; he is alone, after all. Regardless of his intentions, this might be a good opportunity to defeat your most troublesome enemies in the Eight Sects. You will just have to ask them to try and capture alive and unharmed those who are friendly to you &#x2013; unfortunately, they will not understand and will surely see this as a betrayal.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You have your Amesha Spenta stand back for now; if at any time the orthodox pugilists look like they are in danger, you will have them join in to fight Zhang Manxing. Having them enter too early may distract the orthodox fighters.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You will step aside and watch the whole thing play out without interfering. It seems that Nie Wuxing is his main target: if Zhang Manxing can manage to kill him, you would be rid of one of your main foes.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You take the opportunity to leg it. Of course, you do not think that the orthodox pugilists would let your group slip away without a word, but having a distraction from Zhang Manxing is better than none. It&#x2019;ll definitely be easier for you to leave right now.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Ameretat has a potion that will temporarily remove all current exhaustion from your body, allowing you to continue to fight, though it will come at a cost later: she says you may experience temporary enfeeblement for a couple of weeks. It will take quite a few minutes to kick in, however, so if you want to ingest it, it will have to be now.<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You take the potion, consequences be damned.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&#x2019;t take the potion. It is probably not needed at the moment.

            <h3>八十 · Black Dragon Pyre IV</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Black Dragon Pyre IV</b></span><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid you are on your own on this one, Brother Zhang,&#x201D; you say, signalling for your Amesha Spenta to step back. &#x201C;Good luck!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You will not step in?&#x201D; Nie Wuxing raises his eyebrows; he seems to have expected otherwise.<br>
<br>
You merely grin. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t even get paid for taking care of him the first time. &#x201C;<br>
<br>
Zhang spits &#x2013; a large, greenish globule splatters near his feet &#x2013; and snorts disgustedly. &#x201C;I should have known better than to expect you to see reason. No matter. Once I finish with them you may reconsider my offer.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can throw about that sort of talk <i>if </i>you can finish with us.&#x201D; Su Liaojing steps up coolly and swings his staff around in a dizzying series of attacks, the long weapon moving so fast that it appears to blur into a solid wall. At the same time, Su Cheng finally makes the decision to move in, executing his Taishan swordplay with unerring precision. Zhang Manxing decides to retreat under their combined assault. As he steps back, he finds Guo Fu blocking off his path &#x2013; the large Wudang disciple is holding a steady and powerful stance, arms at the ready. He is forced to fight the three of them at once: they exchange blows  rapidly, using all of the techniques at their disposal. At the center of it all, Zhang ducks, dodges and retaliates while laughing like a madman.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Su Liaojing makes a beautiful feint. It succeeds, leading Zhang to leave himself open for just a split second. The staff closes in on his skull; his laughter stops, his bloodshot eyes narrow in a burst of concentration, and he jumps. His bandaged hand lashes outwards at the same time, fingers hooked into claws. The staff is knocked away, and with a somersault Zhang lands behind its wielder. Before Su Liaojing can react, a powerful claw-swipe sends him flying, bleeding from furrows running the length of his back. Zhang Manxing makes use of his momentum and follows through with a side-kick that Su Cheng manages to block &#x2013; at the cost of losing his balance. Laughing, Zhang presses his advantage before Guo Fu can stop him. He charges forward and grabs Su Cheng by the neck.<br>
<br>
The Taishan master lets out a yell, struggling to get his words out. &#x201C;I-I can feel my <i>qi </i>being drained away! Careful! He has learnt how to steal our internal strength!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian leaps in, a red gleam surging through her sword. She executes the Zixia Swordplay with stunning speed &#x2013; only the trails of red <i>qi </i>left behind in the blade&#x2019;s wake can be seen clearly. Somehow, Zhang Manxing manages to throw himself away safely, escaping with nothing more than a few nicks to show for it as Bai&#x2019;s fierce slashes tear up the earth. Mao Sanjiao and Song Lingshu attempt to follow up on the attack, but Zhang gives them the slip with ease, sending Mao stumbling to the ground with a chop to the back of his neck. He whirls around and grabs Lingshu, grinning at her. &#x201C;Guess you&#x2019;re back with him after gallivanting around with Man Tiger Pig, huh? What a slut.&#x201D; Slamming a knee into her stomach, he lets her fall, just in time for him to avoid Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s strike.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Can&#x2019;t you orthodox people fight <i>fairly </i>for once? Teaming up on a lone man? I feel <i>utterly</i> disgraced that I once called you my friends and comrades!&#x201D; exclaims Zhang.<br>
<br>
On your part, you think that teaming up on him seems to be working to their detriment; his moves are unfamiliar to them, and he is erratic enough that they are having a hard time reading his moves. Whether it is by design or luck you do not know, but the effect is that he constantly manages to escape their best attempts to corner him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Time to pay for your misdeeds, traitor!&#x201D; roars Nie, charging at his former disciple&#x2019;s back while he is distracted by Bai. The Chunjun Sword is glowing majestically, evoking the radiance of the sun even in this gloomy weather.<br>
<br>
Zhang laughs derisively. &#x201C;Xixing Great Skill!&#x201D; With a shout, he stretches out both arms, releasing his <i>qi</i>. A powerful current forms around Zhang Manxing. Even from this distance you can feel its turbulence, and nearer to him it is throwing his opponents off balance. The ones closest are visibly drawn towards Zhang, as if he is sucking them in; Nie Wuxing falls and slams his face into the ground as he is dragged onwards, losing his grip on the Chunjun Sword as it clatters harmlessly to the ground.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He&#x2019;s draining them of their <i>qi</i> from a distance,&#x201D; says Ameretat, squinting.<br>
<br>
Vairya looks at you; he does not say anything, but you can feel that he wants to be allowed to join in. Not out of any concern for the orthodox pugilists, but because he sorely wants to test his skills.<br>
<br>
Before you can say anything, you hear Nie Wuxing shout.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xuantiedun!&#x201D; A burst of dark <i>yin </i>qi emanates from the Huashan master, breaking Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s technique. It is the same technique the woman on Taoying Island used, and one of the moves in the Xuanming Jiuyin manual.<br>
<br>
The disruption of Zhang&#x2019;s Xixing Great Skill causes a backlash, throwing him off his feet. As he lands, he screeches happily, &#x201C;See? See? I <i>knew </i>you had it! Now you&#x2019;ll have to give-&#x201C; His words die in his throat as Bai Jiutian&#x2019;s sword pierces his good hand, pinning it to the ground.<br>
<br>
Zhang screams.<br>
<br>
At the same time, Nie Wuxing raises a sword above his head &#x2013; you recognize it as the replica Xuanyuan Sword &#x2013; and prepares to sever Zhang&#x2019;s head from his body.<br>
<br>
The scream turns into laughter.<br>
<br>
With a forceful shrug of his shoulders, the bandages around his stomach loosen, and a cloud of purple dust spills out, spreading into the air&#x2026; you knew there was a reason you didn&#x2019;t feel like committing your forces right away. The orthodox pugilists that had tried to surround him fall away, choking and gasping. Freed from the blade, Zhang Manxing turns towards Bai Jiutian. &#x201C;Here, have your sword back!&#x201D; A dull sword slides out from under his cloak, and he shoves it into Bai&#x2019;s side with a cackle. Bai stumbles back, clutching at the wound.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This useless trickery is nothing before me!&#x201D; coughs Nie Wuxing, waving his sword around weakly but defiantly. He seems to be recovering quickly.<br>
<br>
Whirling around hurriedly, Zhang blocks Nie&#x2019;s Xuanyuan Sword with his misshapen arm &#x2013; it cuts into his flesh, but as the bandages fall away, you see that the arm ends in a sharp spike that seems to be blackened bone and metal where his hand had once been.<br>
<br>
Right, you cut it off, didn&#x2019;t you?<br>
<br>
Zhang smashes the sword with his other hand, snapping it in two, and he proceeds to stab Nie Wuxing with the spike. &#x201C;That was the much vaunted Xuanyuan Sword?&#x201D; he laughs. &#x201C;Perhaps it is the sign of this dynasty&#x2019;s downfall that it broke oh so easily!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father!&#x201D; shout the twins.<br>
<br>
You&#x2019;ve seen enough. &#x201C;Get him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;As you command,&#x201D; say your three Amesha Spenta in perfect synchronicity, and he leaps towards Zhang. Armaiti and Ameretat remain still, however.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why aren&#x2019;t the two of you moving?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2026; don&#x2019;t really want to get in his way at the moment,&#x201D; says Armaiti.<br>
<br>
Ameretat nods. &#x201C;We will join in if we need to.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
At the moment Vairya lands, he shouts. The force of his breath blows away the purple dust, scattering it into nothingness. Zhang Manxing pulls away from Nie Wuxing and turns around. A look of surprise forms under his bandages and is met with a fist before it finishes setting in. Vairya&#x2019;s straight punch sends Zhang staggering back.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You took my punch without flying this time. I am impressed,&#x201D; says Vairya. It looks like his admiration does not extend to giving his dizzied opponent a chance to recover, however, as he follows up with an elbow &#x2013; again to the face &#x2013; that throws Zhang to the ground. Vairya raises his foot and attempts to stomp on Zhang&#x2019;s head, but he manages to roll away. Snarling &#x2013; the first time he has exhibited any expression other than confident arrogance &#x2013; he pounces at Vairya.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2026; what is this? You said you would not interfere!&#x201D; he screams at you while lashing out at Vairya wildly. His claws and kicks draw blood, but the Guardian of Metal remains unperturbed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did I? I only said that you were on your own. You must have misheard me,&#x201D; you say.<br>
<br>
Vairya deflects his uncontrolled attacks and grabs his arm, bending it and causing Zhang Manxing to cry out in pain. Drawing his fist back, the Amesha Spenta shouts. His gleaming muscles bulge, concentrating his powerful <i>qi</i>, and the fist is driven into Zhang&#x2019;s chest with a blow so powerful that the ground underneath their feet seems to ripple. Zhang is sent flying a good distance, only stopping when he crashes into the fortress wall.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What, is that it?&#x201D; Vairya seems slightly disappointed. &#x201C;You have strength and speed,&#x201D; he says, looking down at the wounds caused by Zhang&#x2019;s attacks, &#x201C;but you do not really have the skill to back it up.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He does have the endurance of a cockroach, at least,&#x201D; you comment from the side. &#x201C;I thought that blow would have killed him.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shut up shut up shut up shut up!&#x201D; shouts Zhang again as he clambers out of the indent made in the wall, blood pouring from his mouth. He does not seem to be the most stable person around, and considering who is around here, that is saying something. Stretching out his arms, Zhang attempts to use his Xixing Great Skill again.<br>
<br>
Vairya finds himself dragged towards Zhang, and reflexively digs his feet into the ground.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see how you defeat this move!&#x201D; boasts Zhang as he redoubles his assault, attempting to draw Vairya closer. Even the collapsed, weakened orthodox pugilists are sliding towards him.<br>
<br>
Vairya grins with pleasure. He lets go of his grip on the soil, flying towards Zhang Manxing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hahahahahahahahaha-&#x201C; Zhang cuts his laughter short, suddenly realizing what Vairya plans to do, and makes a run for it. He rolls away just before Vairya&#x2019;s headbutt strikes where his own head would have been, blowing an even bigger hole in the wall.<br>
<br>
He begins crawling away from Vairya, looking behind him in panic.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shall I end this now, little lord?&#x201D; says Vairya, cricking his neck and cracking his knuckles.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-I-I&#x2026;&#x201D; Zhang mutters.<br>
<br>
You wonder if he is about to scream for mercy.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father! Father, where are you? Help me! They want to kill me!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His shout rings out across the field, and is answered only by a thunderclap. You look around you. There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be anything.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s make sure everyone is safe first,&#x201D; you say, and it is then that the ground cracks.<br>
<br>
Rock and earth erupt upwards with a ear-shattering roar. Through the falling dirt, you see a spindly hand rise up and claw into the ground; a thin, bearded old man tunnels his way up into the light like a demon from the depths of the underworld. His eyes are sewn shut; his nose has been removed. Heavy iron manacles are clapped around his wrists and ankles, though his chest is bare and hollow.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh boy,&#x201D; you murmur under your breath.<br>
<br>
Vairya does not wait for your command: he immediately goes after the newcomer eagerly. Shouting, he throws a fist that has the same amount of strength behind as the one that blew Zhang Manxing away. The blind old man turns, opens his almost toothless mouth, and bites into Vairya&#x2019;s fist, holding it there like one would an apple.<br>
<br>
Vairya attempts to follow through with a kick, but the old man tilts  his head upwards, still biting onto that fist in his mouth. The Amesha Spenta finds himself swung into the air before being flung away with a shake of the old man&#x2019;s neck. He tumbles and lands by your side, a strange mixture of intense interest and slight embarassment on his face.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2026; does not taste good,&#x201D; mutters Yang Xue, spitting on the ground. &#x201C;Too tough&#x2026; too tough. Now where is my son? I heard him calling for me. Where are you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Father, I am here!&#x201D; screams Zhang as he embraces Yang&#x2019;s legs. &#x201C;Help me! These people are trying to kill me! They work for the Emperor!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did the moves I teach you avail to nothing?&#x201D; The former general shakes his head sternly. &#x201C;But&#x2026; no matter. Very well, I shall deal with my son&#x2019;s enemies!&#x201D; declares Yang Xue. &#x201C;I will not let minions of the Emperor stand by and insult my kin any longer!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You tense up. This could be bad. You can sense a killing intent from him that far surpasses anything you have felt before. The old man is serious this time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xixing Great Skill!&#x201D; shouts Yang Xue, raising his hands into the air. The ravaged ground under his feet cracks, the earth shudders, and the wind begins to rise. The clouds above his head are drawn into a spiral as his immense <i>qi </i>blankets the land&#x2026; and begins to pull. You can feel your <i>qi </i>leaving your body at the same time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Grab hold of something!&#x201D; you shout out; clawing the ground, you hang on for dear life as Yang Xue&#x2019;s technique draws in everything in sight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Perhaps I should try headbutting him,&#x201D; Vairya muses besides you &#x2013; his fist embedded deep in the earth to secure his position. He doesn&#x2019;t seem to fear Yang Xue at all, even after that display of oral strength.<br>
<br>
There is a sudden burst of powerful <i>qi</i>. An invisible wind slices the land in front of Yang Xue &#x2013; his concentration broken, he stops using his technique. Dozens of bodies drop to the ground, groaning in pain.<br>
<br>
The Sword Saint is standing atop the wall alone, holding his heavy Zhanlu Sword aloft with his one hand. A faint look of regret can be seen in his eyes. &#x201C;I did not expect this to happen,&#x201D; he says, leaping down to join you. &#x201C;What exactly is going on?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Crazy young man and <i>crazy </i>old man trying to kill us all,&#x201D; you summarize. You can&#x2019;t help but look over at Cao&#x2019;er and the rest of your group, who are attempting to hold together &#x2013; with the number of wounded people that you are looking after, fighting Yang Xue and Zhang Manxing here may be quite problematic. More worryingly, you don&#x2019;t see Xuezi anywhere &#x2013; did she get blown away in the fight just now? You&#x2019;ll have to get one of your companions to look for her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Kill, kill all these sanctimonious, hypocritical bastards!&#x201D; shouts Zhang. Yang roars in agreement.<br>
<br>
You feel the exhaustion wearing away, and energy rushing throughout your body. It looks like the medicine has taken effect.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>The target of this fight is to escape safely. You will order a retreating action and fend off Yang Xue and Zhang Manxing as best as you can. You might not be able to save everyone, but this way you should be able to save those that matter.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will take the fight to the enemy while the noncombatants retreat as far as they can: with the Sword Saint and Vairya together, it should not be impossible to defeat or force them to retreat. You will focus on Yang Xue, as he is the biggest threat here. Zhang Manxing can be dealt with by someone else.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You will have everyone still able to attack Yang Xue and fend him off while those who cannot will pull back &#x2013; at the same time, you will go after Zhang Manxing with those you can spare to aid you. You would prefer to handle him personally&#x2026; there&#x2019;s no telling what other tricks he might have up his sleeve.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You take the risk of using Wuxiang Qiankun.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You don&#x2019;t take the risk of using Wuxiang Qiankun.

            <h3>八十一 · Battle at Black Dragon Gate</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Battle at Black Dragon Gate</span></b><br>
<br>
You decide to focus all of your attentions on the old man. If you can just bring him down here, the others can take care of Zhang Manxing.<br>
<br>
Vairya rushes in, fists flying towards Yang Xue. Even though blinded, the old man tracks his actions unerringly. He swats aside Vairya&#x2019;s punches with a wave of his arm, exchanging a few moves before successfully retaliates with a powerful blow that shakes the air. Vairya receives it head-on: literally. With a shout, he meets the pointed fingers of Yang Xue with his head. The skin splits, but the bone underneath does not crack &#x2013; gritting his teeth, Vairya pushes Yang Xue back. At the same time, the Sword Saint leaps over him and slashes twice with his Zhanlu Sword. The black blade manages to draw blood. Even so, Yang Xue remains unperturbed; the cuts are nothing but shallow. Laughing, his bony arm snaps straight and grabs the Great Sword by the flat of its blade. Yang Xue swings, hurling the Sword Saint away. Though he manages to land on his feet, Vairya comes barreling into him a second later, having been sent off with a kick.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue comes charging in, but Qi Liuwu blindsides him with his feet, and Jiu Mo follows up with a distracting Xianglong Palm strike. Ameretat steps forward to aid them while the Sword Saint and Vairya regain their breath.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m barely at sixty percent of my previous strength in this condition,&#x201D; says Shangguan, a rare hint of frustration flashing across his face. &#x201C;Not that I am certain of beating this strange old man even if I were at my peak.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sorry, I&#x2019;ll try to pick up the slack,&#x201D; you reply half-embarrassedly, patting the donated arm. Then, you say to the kneeling Amesha Spenta, &#x201C;Vairya, you are making a fool of yourself. What about your ultimate technique?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Little lord, there is no fun in showing your trump card too soon in a fight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You tried to use it on me <i>pretty </i>quickly!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That was a duel between two warriors. The situation is different,&#x201D; he says jovially and without a hint of remorse.<br>
<br>
You scowl at his excuse. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll try to buy you an opening.&#x201D; The Sword Saint returns to the fray ahead of you, and you join in just shortly after.<br>
<br>
A swift and sudden application of the Xixing Great Skill leaves Ameretat and Jiu Mou off-balance and helpless. Whirling around, Yang Xue matches Qi Liuwu kick for kick and overcomes him, sending the armless beggar flying straight up into the air. &#x201C;You will not succeed in using my own techniques against me!&#x201D; he shouts.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll see about that.&#x201D; You&#x2019;ve spent enough time watching to grasp his movement with Wuxiang Qiankun. Allowing the harmonized <i>qi </i>to guide your movements, you strike back at Yang Xue, imitating his every move.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;More mimicry? Foolish fools!&#x201D; Yang Xue&#x2019;s strength is so far beyond yours that even with Wuxiang Qiankun, even with the other fighters helping out, you cannot keep up an exchange of blows with him for long. A stray, glancing blow from the old man causes your bones to tremble. You are forced back a step. He crawls forward on all four limbs, howling, and attempts to gnaw at your shins. Slightly panicked, you leap out of the way just in time to see a recovered Guo Fu falling upon Yang Xue, attempting to pin him to the ground. The old man shouts and slams the ground with his fists &#x2013; the <i>qi </i>emanating from his body is enough to toss even Guo Fu&#x2019;s big bulk into the air. His follow-up attempt to run his fist through Guo&#x2019;s chest is intercepted by the Sword Saint, who swings his sword rapidly in a dazzling array of slashes that entrap Yang Xue where he stands.<br>
<br>
Numerous wounds form all over Yang&#x2019;s body, spurting blood. These seem to cut a little deeper than before, and Yang Xue falls back with a cry. You press the attack &#x2013; in this situation, you already know what he&#x2019;ll do in response to your moves.<br>
<br>
A left hook to the head will force him to retaliate with an upwards swinging claw.<br>
<br>
You step back, having seen it coming. You just need him to overstretch one time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Vairya roars. The earth breaks under his feet as he charges forth and splits the air.<br>
<br>
His arms swing forward, concentrated with the full might of his considerable internal energy: even Yang Xue would not be able to take this and remain fully unscathed, you think.<br>
<br>
You are not sure what happened next.<br>
<br>
Somehow, Vairya&#x2019;s most powerful technique misses.<br>
<br>
At the very last instant, Yang Xue twists himself around at an impossible angle &#x2013; one that should have broken his spine &#x2013; and evades the attack by a hair&#x2019;s breadth.<br>
<br>
The force of Vairya&#x2019;s <i>qi</i> batters a large crater in the earthen wall behind Yang Xue, but otherwise leaves the old man unharmed. He untwines himself and slams the side of his palm into Vairya&#x2019;s temple in a furious blow hard enough that the ground cracks under their feet and the trees around the fortress shed their leaves from the tremor. Caught by surprise, the Amesha Spenta is sent tumbling to the ground.<br>
<br>
Then, laughing out loud, he goes on the attack. Leaping from a standing position, his feet move so rapidly that you cannot follow them: this is his mastered version of the Shadowless Thunder Breaker. It would be suicide to try and block it. You have to evade. The kicks blow great holes in the landscape, forcing you and your companions to scatter while at the same time propelling Yang Xue to where he wants to go.<br>
<br>
With this trick Yang Xue isolates Jiu Mou. Landing in front of him, he grins at the young beggar. Jiu Mou shouts &#x2013; seeing no way out, he uses a desperation attack: The Dragon&#x2019;s Flight Shakes The Earth. Yang Xue meets Jiu Mou&#x2019;s palms with his own. Even the entirety of Jiu Mou&#x2019;s internal energy, combined with the Xianglong Eighteen Palms technique, is insufficient. Yang Xue simply overpowers Jiu Mou with his godly inner strength. It is as if the beggar had been hit by a flying wall &#x2013; he is flung off into the distance, only coming to a rest after smashing a few trees in his flight.<br>
<br>
Qi Liuwu arrives just a moment too late to save his prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;. His kicks are intercepted and broken, along with his right leg. A sweeping kick from Yang Xue blasts past Qi&#x2019;s own defenses &#x2013; while you are hurrying to get there, you can audibly hear the bones crack. The old beggar falls to the ground in pain. You slash out with your wodao, attempting to stop Yang Xue from finishing off Qi. At the same time, the Sword Saint approaches with a low slash from the other side. Yang Xue reaches out and stops both your blades with his bare hands.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xixing Great Skill!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
His use of the technique immobilizes both you and the Sword Saint: you can feel your <i>qi </i>starting to drain through your sword, though you are unable to let go. The drain is so powerful that you are forced to exert every ounce of mastery and control over your <i>qi </i>to counteract it; you cannot reverse it, but you can certainly protect yourself and Shangguan Chuji from being sucked dry in an instant.<br>
<br>
Shouting a battle cry, Guo Fu charges at him, wrapping his thick arms around Yang Xue&#x2019;s waist. He heaves and roars, attempting to lift Yang off the ground. It is as if Guo Fu is attempting to raise an immovable boulder rooted to the earth. Though he is considerably larger, and heavier, and seemingly physically stronger, the stick-thin Yang Xue does not budge.<br>
<br>
He merely grins.<br>
<br>
He lifts his head back and smashes his bony jaw onto the back of Guo Fu&#x2019;s skull. Crying out, Guo lets go and slumps to the ground, blood spurting from his head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Lord Jing!&#x201D; Vines shoot up towards Yang Xue at Ameretat&#x2019;s command, piercing his aged body. They wither on contact, however, shrivelled by the malicious vitality coursing through his veins.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Retrieve the injured and heal them!&#x201D; you yell out. Ameretat acknowledges your order and darts in to recover those wounded by Yang Xue. He attempts to intercept her, but at the same time, you still have him pinned thanks to his Xixing Great Skill. The Sword Saint is contributing too, forcing the full might of his sword <i>qi </i>down upon Yang Xue &#x2013; at this moment, if the old man loses concentration he could easily lose an arm.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is it for you!&#x201D; Bai Jiutian chooses that moment to strike &#x2013; she has been waiting for the right opportunity all this while. Her sword engulfed in shadow, she charges forward, stabbing at Yang Xue&#x2019;s neck. The tip of the blade hits skin, and is stopped. The darkness flares as Bai Jiutian yells, pushing all of her strength into this one attack, and the sword slowly begins to sink in, penetrating Yang Xue&#x2019;s defenses. Blood trickles from the wound as the blade is forced through, bit by bit.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue lets out a cry of frustration. Then, without warning, he reverses the flow of <i>qi</i>, sending it pumping outwards.<br>
<br>
The Sword Saint is knocked back, freed of Yang Xue&#x2019;s grasp.<br>
<br>
Bai&#x2019;s sword shatters as she too is thrown away, leaving behind a shard of steel in the old man&#x2019;s neck.<br>
<br>
You, on the other hand, absorb as much of the impact as you can, mimicking Yang Xue&#x2019;s Xixing Great Skill to help in this. There is rather too much <i>qi </i>for you to handle in one go, however &#x2013; you can feel the harmonious streams of <i>qi </i>in your body waver under the strain of this unnatural load, about to collapse back into chaos. With <i>this much</i> internal energy in play&#x2026; this is going to wreck your body when it happens. You can feel blood welling up in your mouth as every fiber of your being begins protesting the stress that you are subjecting them to.<br>
<br>
There must be something you can do, something to turn it all around&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Yang Xue breaks off contact. The sudden void leaves you stumbling; you fall back onto your butt, gasping for breath.<br>
<br>
His hand is held out in front of him, balled into a fist. Blood drips from between his fingers, and when he opens his hands, you see a blood-stained rock. Yang&#x2019;s fingers close again, sharply, and crush the rock into powder. &#x201C;Name yourself!&#x201D; he calls out.<br>
<br>
The response is polite but not at all soft, and you can sense the barely restrained glee under it all.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am Zhang Jue,&#x201D; says your master from atop the wall, &#x201C;and it seems that today will be a good day for glorious combat.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
At long last, the rain begins to fall.

            <h3>八十二 · Duel at Black Dragon Gate</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Duel at Black Dragon Gate</span></b><br>
<br>
Pointing his arms towards Zhang Jue, Yang Xue shouts, unleashing his Xixing Great Skill. This time, the move is targeted and focused on a single area. The wall under the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s feet begins to crumble, weakened by the powerful pull from the skill. Zhang Jue leaps into the rainy skies before it collapses entirely.<br>
<br>
That is exactly Yang Xue wants. He kicks off from the ground with a powerful stomp, flying off to meet Zhang in battle &#x2013; in aerial combat, his Wuying Leipo Kick is unmatched.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shadowless Thunder Breaker!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Yang Xue&#x2019;s kick moves so fast that it seems like he has sprouted another eleven legs to your eye. Kicks rain down on Zhang Jue from all directions, almost simultaneously, each of them thrown with enough power to fell a master-level opponent. He manages to evade the first two in mid-air, but is forced to block the third. There is a loud bang, coinciding with a flash of lightning streaking through the sky. You can see Master Zhang grit his teeth under the force of that blow. The rest of the kicks home in on him with deadly accuracy, looking to finish him off.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Raging Claws of the Mad Lion!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zhang Jue retaliates, counter-attacking upwards at the last second. His claws, sharpened and strengthened by his considerable internal energy, lash out at Yang Xue with blinding speed. With a grunt of effort, Yang Xue stops his assault of kicks, pulling back before Zhang&#x2019;s blows can land. Spinning around, he changes his pattern and unleashes a flurry of swooping claws to match Zhang&#x2019;s own. The two exchange moves as they float downwards with their <i>qinggong</i> &#x2013; the wild bursts of <i>qi </i>from their attacks fly outwards, gouging long lines in earth and sky. To your eyes, it seems that Master Zhang appears to be gaining the advantage, bit by bit. Pulling off a quick, deceptive movement from the Claws of the Hidden Tiger, he manages to outmaneuver Yang Xue and grab his opponent&#x2019;s arms by the wrists. Shouting, he forces the old man&#x2019;s bony arms apart, his own muscles bulging as he strains to do so. Yang Xue too is screaming in rage, attempting to overcome the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s restraints. With a powerful effort, Zhang Jue spins the old man upside down. His subsequent roar is loud enough to drown out the thunder. Raindrops are scattered in a wide area as Zhang Jue, focusing all of his <i>qi </i>into his right hand, sinks his claws into Yang Xue&#x2019;s belly. His fingers twist and turn, digging into the old, withered flesh. Baring his ancient gums, Yang strikes out at Zhang, his bony elbows landing powerful strikes that ripple the Southern Maniac&#x2019;s back. Zhang Jue does not let go. He charges downwards, using his power and momentum to smash Yang into the ground. The muddy ground around them gives way, and a crater is formed under an impact so strong that you are almost blown off your feet.<br>
<br>
Steam rises where the rain hits the ground, forming a light mist that covers the torn-up field in front of the crumbling Black Dragon fortress.<br>
<br>
You crawl back to your feet. Did Master Zhang do it?<br>
<br>
You see Master Zhang standing above the crater, his breathing slightly heavy. Blood streams from his back and his mouth, and his right arm appears to be injured. &#x201C;The crater is&#x2026; empty?&#x201D; he murmurs. Suddenly, he braces himself. A skinny foot blasts forth from underneath the earth, breaking through the rock. The attack is sufficiently powerful to rip past Zhang Jue&#x2019;s guard, sending him hurtling away. Cackling, Yang Xue breaks free from the ground and bounds after Zhang. Blood spills from his abdomen, yet he does not appear to be bothered. &#x201C;Excellent! Excellent! I have not had such an interesting battle in a long time! My blood has not heated up like this ever since facing those so-called orthodox pugilists, the traitors from Wudang and Shaolin! Come, entertain me more!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Zhang Jue only manages to get up in the nick of time, still groggy from Yang&#x2019;s surprise attack. He fends off the old man&#x2019;s powerful attacks, but somehow Yang Xue has managed to draw out even more power and speed from within himself&#x2026; his internal energy seems to be endless. Step by step, Zhang is forced back, though with every blow he suffers the grin on his face grows. His spirit is unbreakable.<br>
<br>
Still, the situation does not seem good. You weigh the risks of going in to assist your master&#x2026; you may have no choice.<br>
<br>
Howling victoriously, Yang Xue pushes Zhang Jue&#x2019;s arms apart with a forceful chop. Having carved out this opportunity, the old man claps both his hands together on Zhang&#x2019;s head, his fingers digging into his temples. &#x201C;Now, have another taste of my Xixing Great Skill!&#x201D; Zhang Jue growls as the drain on his internal energy starts to take its toll &#x2013; though he tries, he is unable to break Yang Xue&#x2019;s grip. Your master begins to visibly weaken.<br>
<br>
A loud roar hurts your ears. A flash of lightning illuminates the rain. A powerful gust of wind blasts past you. Yang Xue turns, but this time he is a fraction of a second too late.<br>
<br>
Vairya&#x2019;s fists sink into the old man&#x2019;s side. Yang Xue shouts, stamping his feet into the ground as he takes the full force of the Amesha Spenta&#x2019;s most powerful attack. Blood spurts from his lips, the earth cracks, and the land behind him is practically flattened.<br>
<br>
You have to wonder just how much longer the ground can take this sort of abuse.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue holds. Just for a second. Then, he is flung off with a yell, skidding to a halt a short distance away. He remains on his feet, however. His breathing is ragged as he clutches his belly. Vairya does not let up &#x2013; he continues his attack without giving Yang Xue any respite. The rain sliding off his polished body, he throws down blow after blow upon the old man, hammering away with his fists. Yang Xue is forced to step back, only barely fending off Vairya&#x2019;s assault. He darts behind a tree, which shatters with a single blow from the Amesha Spenta. Moving away, Yang reaches another tree, as wide around as a human, and he places one hand upon its bark as if to support himself.<br>
<br>
His fingers burrow into the wood, and then he single-handedly uproots the tree. Whirling around, he swings it at his enemy.<br>
<br>
Vairya meets it with his fists, attempting to break it as he did the last, but too late he realizes that Yang Xue has infused the wood with his powerful <i>qi</i>. He ends up being slammed into the ground by the tree. As Yang raises the long, heavy lumber over his head to crush Vairya, the Sword Saint jumps in to intercept the blow. The Zhanlu Sword cuts into the tree and repels it, throwing the massive piece of wood back.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue grabs the tree with both hands to balance himself and twists his fingers, channeling his internal energy throughout its entire length. It splits apart, the branches and leaves falling off, the ends of the tree flaking away until what is left looks like a gigantic spear. He twirls it over his head expertly, handling it with greater ease than any spear master would with a normal-sized one, and drives the Sword Saint back with a flurry of precise jabs. Even Shangguan Chuji has no room to launch any ripostes under Yang Xue&#x2019;s masterful spear assault. He desperately brings the Zhanlu Sword in front of him &#x2013; the tip of the spear smashes against the flat of the blade with a loud bang. The Sword Saint is launched into the sky from the explosive force of Yang Xue&#x2019;s thrust. If he had been wielding any other sword, it is likely that the spear would have shattered the blade and run him through.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue laughs proudly. &#x201C;With spear in hand I am unparalleled under the heavens!&#x201D; He raises the massive polearm, larger and wider than he is, with only one hand. Yang begins advancing towards your master, who is attempting to recuperate from the fight. The Sword Saint has landed a considerable distance away, and Vairya is still dizzy from being smashed with the tree. Ameretat is taking care of the other wounded pugilists; Yang Xue&#x2019;s attacks have done quite a number on them.<br>
<br>
You shrug and sigh. &#x201C;Oh, bother.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The giant spear jabs forward. Inches away from Zhang Jue, its massive bulk shudders, and it glances off to the side. The deviation is slight, but it is enough for him to evade the attack. Yang Xue turns, his sewn-shut eyes seeking you out. Your palm is outstretched, having used The Lone Dragon Battles in the Wilderness to knock the spear off its trajectory from a distance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll play with you, Gramps!&#x201D; you shout, running towards him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Take this, my Conqueror&#x2019;s Spear!&#x201D; roars Yang Xue, swinging the spear around to meet you.<br>
<br>
The tip of the polearm snakes towards you, the trunk of the tree appearing to bend in mid-air. Reading his moves with Wuxiang Qiankun, you know that it is too fast for you to evade: even if you avoid the sharp end, Yang Xue is skilled enough to strike at you with the pole. The point of the spear gouges your side as you try to dart past &#x2013; and as expected, he swings at you. You were counting on that. Raising the Chixiao Sword, you block the swing in a manner similar to the Sword Saint. Using your knowledge of Taiji, you absorb as much force as you can and disperse it by twisting your body. The remaining power behind the strike is still strong enough to send you flying, but at least you are alive.<br>
<br>
Reaching out, you cast out strings of spider silk at the surrounding trees still standing. You manage to knot a few &#x2013; gripping the strings firmly, you swing yourself around Yang Xue. He whirls around to track you, thrusting his spear upwards. You let go of the strings; the spear passes just under you, splitting the spider silk into fine pieces. Somersaulting in the air, you land on the tree-spear and run down it, towards the old man. The red gleam of the Chixiao Sword shines brighter as a chaotic swirl of energy forms around it. &#x201C;Red Cloud Sword!&#x201D; You leap forward, combining this technique with the Fiery Flight of the Vermillion Phoenix. Your powerful swings tear up chunks of the spear under your feet as you close the last gap between you and Yang Xue. Still holding on to his spear, his head bobs and weaves as he narrowly evades the first three strikes. On the fourth, he spins the spear, attempting to make you lose your footing. You hop up and link your fifth strike with another use of the spider silk, wrapping it around his head to steady yourself. You yell out. The sixth slash closes in on his neck. Yang Xue is forced to free one hand from the spear to block it. His fingers close around the red blade &#x2013; this time, it cuts into the palm of his hand, and the blood causes the Chixiao Sword to glow an even more brilliant crimson.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue roars, and pushes back. In a contest of strength, it is a foregone conclusion. You know that, at least. After resisting for only a second, you let go of the sword. He overreaches, losing his balance. This is the real chance you have been waiting for, after feints upon feints upon feints &#x2013; luring the opponent into extending themselves too far is the first step of the Deceptive Fish Stab.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue lets go of the spear fully, his other hand rising up to compensate for his mistake by crushing your skull. The Yuchang Sword appears in your hand as if by magic &#x2013; using your sleight-of-hand skills, you draw it from your clothes in an instant, unnoticed to the blind old man. His clawed hand hesitates for just a split-second as he hears the ring of the sword leaving its scabbard. That is all you need.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the Golden Fangs of the White Tiger.<br>
<br>
And the Reflective Blade&#x2019;s Shadow.<br>
<br>
The Yuchang Sword bursts forth from its sheath, infused with the full power of your internal energy. The shadowy darkness engulfing the blade slowing and speeding it up erratically. You shout, guiding the sword on a snaking path that bends around Yang&#x2019;s outstretched arms, past his attempts to defend himself, and towards his head.<br>
<br>
Thunder rumbles overhead.<br>
<br>
You feel the sword bite into flesh.<br>
<br>
Then, it moves no more, no matter how hard you press.<br>
<br>
The seams holding Yang Xue&#x2019;s eyes shut have popped open, cut apart by the power of your attack, and he stares down at you with cloudy, milky eyes that transfix you to the spot.<br>
<br>
He is holding the edge of your blade between his rotted teeth. Blood is pouring from his grinning mouth.<br>
<br>
Too late, you forget to let go of the sword.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue does it for you.<br>
<br>
A powerful kick lands right in your ribs, crushing quite a few of them. You tumble to the ground, coughing up blood. Fingers scrabbling in the mud, you try to move away from Yang Xue. There is a loud creaking noise &#x2013; the wood groans as he retakes his giant spear and lifts it up again.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue turns away from you, heaving the spear over his shoulder with a dismissive snort. His attention lies elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Master Zhang is standing upright again, drenched by the pouring rain. His eyes are shut, his breathing heavy. The blood from his wounds mingle with the dripping rainwater as they wash down towards his feet. He is holding a spear in each hand, taken from the fallen Black Dragon mercenaries that had not managed to get out of the way of this fight in time.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you seek to challenge my spear again with your own?&#x201D; says Yang Xue. He seems intrigued by the idea.<br>
<br>
Zhang Jue smiles faintly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is not my preferred weapon by far&#x2026; but today, I will make an exception.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let us see how you do then, brat!&#x201D; Yang Xue swings his massive spear around with a cry, his bony, emaciated frame moving faster and stronger than it has any right to be. Zhang Jue deftly parries the old man&#x2019;s weapon with his own. The two men dance around each other, their spears laying waste to the landscape around them. Surprisingly, although you have never seen him touch the weapon before, your master is extremely adept with the polearm&#x2026; he easily matches Yang Xue in skill, even if not in sheer power. They exchange blows, striking and parrying and jabbing, appearing to be evenly matched. Cuts open up all over their bodies, inflicted by the deadly spears each of them wield with supreme mastery. Yet neither of them give way.<br>
<br>
Lightning strikes with a deafening roar. Blinding white light floods the land, and Yang squints, faltering for just a second &#x2013; it is too much for his newly exposed eyes. Zhang Jue does not hesitate to take advantage of this opportunity. He hurls one of his spears at Yang Xue. The old man grabs it by the shaft before it strikes; the force of Zhang&#x2019;s throw drives him back, his feet leaving furrows in the ground. The grip tightens, and Yang breaks the spear in two. Another flash of lightning tears across the clouds. Yang Xue&#x2019;s head snaps up &#x2013; Zhang is charging at him with spear in hand, too swiftly for him to dodge.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A head-on confrontation? Very well, I will accept your challenge!&#x201D; Yang Xue roars. &#x201C;Heaven-Piercing Earth-Conquering Spear!&#x201D; He girds himself and thrusts his spear forth, at Zhang Jue.<br>
<br>
Your master slams his spear-arm forward and roars. &#x201C;Conquering Spear of the Broken Emperor!&#x201D; The metal tip of his spear meets the wooden point of Yang Xue&#x2019;s own. A shockwave explodes outwards where the two spears have made contact, throwing mud and rainwater into the air.<br>
<br>
The two men push at each other, causing the ground to shudder. Despite their parity in technique, it is clear that Yang Xue holds the upper hand here &#x2013; his immense <i>qi </i>reserves and powerful inner strength begin pushing Zhang Jue back. Hairline cracks begin to form in Zhang&#x2019;s spear. He grits his teeth and redoubles his effort, bracing his feet against the earth.<br>
<br>
Shangguan Chuji stumbles forward, still unsteady on his feet. Reaching Zhang Jue&#x2019;s back, he places one hand on his shoulder and donates his <i>qi</i>. Zhang turns to glare at him, evidently displeased, but he does not say anything. His trembling, straining arm grows steady.<br>
<br>
Vairya arrives, looking at you while clutching his abdomen. &#x201C;So, little lord?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What else?&#x201D; you shrug. You crawl up to your feet and reach out Master Zhang. You can feel Vairya&#x2019;s fists pressing against your shoulders, charging you up with his energy. You place your own hands on your master&#x2019;s back. The connection is made &#x2013; in an instant, you can feel all of the disparate power swirling around from the Sword Saint, Vairya, and your master.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not help,&#x201C; warns your master, but you ignore him.<br>
<br>
Breathing in deeply, you combine and regulate the diverse <i>qi</i>, using yourself as a conduit. The burst of power surges forth into Zhang Jue, up his arm, and into the spear.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue looks surprise as he is now the one who is starting to be pushed back. He strains himself and yells. &#x201C;Impressive! Let us see how you deal with this!&#x201D; Summoning even more of his reserves, he pours forth a torrent of <i>qi </i>into his spear attack. Small sparks of flame begin drifting off the former tree. You wince at the impact &#x2013; it travels through your master and hits you painfully. You hold your ground, however, continuing to perform your task. The Sword Saint and Vairya gird themselves, attempting to hold on. You do not know how long you can last&#x2026; will Yang Xue run out of energy before you do?<br>
<br>
Then, to your surprise, you feel a new influx of energy, a dark, <i>yin</i> flow. You look to your side. Bai Jiutian is standing there, lending you her strength.<br>
<br>
A large flow of bright and balanced <i>qi </i>joins the mix next. Guo Fu.<br>
<br>
And Ameretat.<br>
<br>
And Qi Liuwu, limping on one leg, using his remaining good foot to help out.<br>
<br>
You close your eyes, drawing upon the Impermanent Way of the Chaotic World. All comes from the Origin and returns to the Origin. Melding all of these disparate energies into a single, powerful flow, you channel it into your master and join your strength to his.<br>
<br>
He shouts out, feeling the influx of power surging through his body. The wind whips up as the thunder echoes his roar.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue&#x2019;s spear begins to crack deeply, dark lines running along its entire length. The wood peels, flaying away&#x2026; and then, it bursts into flames.<br>
<br>
Zhang Jue steps forward. Your hands leave his back, but he does not need assistance any longer. With a powerful thrust, he drives his spear forth, twisting his grip. It pierces Yang Xue&#x2019;s burning weapon, splitting it, splintering it, shattering it. Yang Xue howls and throws his arms up in defense, but it is too late. Zhang Jue&#x2019;s spear impales him, the point of it piercing through his back. Zhang lets go of the weapon at the same time &#x2013; the spear flies away, spiraling <i>qi </i>trailing behind it. Carrying Yang Xue with it, the spear slams into the walls of the fortress. Large cracks form from the point of impact, running around the entire length of the barrier. Yang Xue groans, pinned to the spot. His hands fall limp and his head lolls forward. Blood gushes forth from the wound in his chest, streaming down in the endless rain.<br>
<br>
You sink to your knees, exhausted from your effort, and so do the others. Your master remains standing, but you can see that the flesh on his arm has split bloodily from the effort of driving that spear through Yang Xue.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ahahahaha! I have gotten what I need!&#x201D; Suddenly, you hear Zhang Manxing laugh out in glee, and he prances into view. &#x201C;Let us go now, Father! Have you exterminated the vermin yet?&#x201D; He turns, looking around him before his gaze falls upon the mortally wounded Yang Xue pinned to the walls of the fortress. &#x201C;F-father?&#x201D; A look of panic passes across his face, and he bounds towards Yang Xue.<br>
<br>
Both you and Bai Jiutian leap forward simultaneously to stop him, but in your current states neither of you are quick enough reach him in time. He pulls out a pouch and hurls it onto the ground to cover his movement; a dark green cloud of powder flies up into the air. You pull back, and so does Bai. No telling what that does.<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing hops up the broken wall, close to Yang Xue. &#x201C;Father! What have they done to you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;S-son,&#x201D; murmurs Yang weakly. &#x201C;My&#x2026; son&#x2026; run&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He looks around him. The pugilists are closing in &#x2013; even though all of you have been weakened from the battle, he will not stand a chance against so many fighters. A desperate glint enters his eyes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; Father, drink up! This will help you to become better! I will not leave without you!&#x201D; he cries out mournfully. Bringing up a small medicinal flask, he pours the contents into Yang Xue&#x2019;s bloody mouth. Even from this distance, you can notice the emblem of the Black Dragon Society on it.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue lets out a deep, guttural roar. His internal energy explodes outwards in an earth-shattering blast as every last bit of the fortress walls collapse behind him. All of you are sent flying even further away, pushed back by his power. The storm clouds overhead begin swirling, the very air itself becoming infused with a seemingly limitless flood of <i>qi</i>. The raindrops are flung about wildly as a chaotic wind whips up across the field. An immense pressure bears down upon you&#x2026; the only time you have felt anything comparable was in the chamber of the Fire Temple, with Ahura, and you sense that this power may be even greater. Zhang Manxing crawls aside fearfully. His gaze is filled with tension &#x2013; he is probably ready to flee at any moment.<br>
<br>
<i>Son! My son!</i><br>
<br>
The powerful voice echoes across the field, ringing in the air. Yang Xue is staring up at the dark, stormy sky, his arms raised high. He must have spoken, but his mouth has not opened even once.<br>
<br>
<i>You were right! I do feel a lot better now! In fact, I feel at least ten times more powerful than before!</i><br>
<br>
&#x201C;He is speaking using his internal energy, transmitting his words directly into the air,&#x201D; explains the Sword Saint, shaking his head. &#x201C;This does not bode well for us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not out of things to try yet,&#x201D; says Master Zhang calmly. &#x201C;I am not worried.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are never worried,&#x201D; sighs Shangguan.<br>
<br>
Zhang Manxing laughs out happily and runs to Yang Xue&#x2019;s side. &#x201C;I&#x2026; yes, it really made you better!&#x201D; He seems slightly perplexed himself at how it has turned out. If your guess is right, that was the medicine that created the berserk warriors. He must have tried to make Yang Xue go berserk in order to cover his escape, but it seems to have given him a better outcome than he expected.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;He has obtained the Jiuyin Manual from Huashan,&#x201D; says Xuezi calmly as she makes a surprise appearance at your side. And strangely enough, behind her is Lady Ji, who gives you a courteous but silent nod.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well! Well! Well!&#x201D; cackles Zhang Manxing.<br>
<br>
<i>Shall I destroy all of the enemies for you, my son?</i><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, no, not yet. There is yet something I must ask!&#x201D; he grins. &#x201C;Xu Jing! Oh, Xu Jing! You cannot fool my eyes now! You have mastered the third of the legendary skills, the Wuxiang Qiankun Skill, have you not?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You shrug as all attention falls upon you. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t explain your fertile imagination for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be shy now,&#x201D; he laughs. &#x201C;I am offering you one last chance to cooperate with me. Show up at the upcoming Huashan Summit with the Wuxiang Qiankun scrolls, and I will share with you the greatest power this country has ever known!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<i>Are you sure about this, Son?</i><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course, Father. We need allies&#x2026; for now,&#x201D; says Zhang Manxing confidently.<br>
<br>
<i>Perhaps you are right&#x2026; I did not have many allies myself. You are wise, my son.</i><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I cannot see why you need allies when you can wipe us all out here,&#x201D; you call out.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That would be no fun at all!&#x201D; Zhang Manxing laughs in reply, but you can sense that he is not telling the full truth. He keeps darting glances at Yang Xue nervously when he thinks no one is looking&#x2026; perhaps the drug may be unreliable or unpredictable? Regardless, he now seems to want to leave the fight if he can.<br>
<br>
You glance at Xuezi. Lady Ji has mysteriously disappeared again, before you can ask her anything. You will need to do something about that one day.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If you need my help, you need only ask. But I won&#x2019;t guarantee your safety or your victory. You&apos;ll have to look after yourself, you&apos;re a grown boy,&#x201D; Xuezi snorts. It looks like she isn&#x2019;t unwilling to help out here.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>If Zhang Manxing escapes here, you suspect he will be going ahead to obtain the Jiuyang Manual from his clan. If that happens, he might become unstoppable. This must end here. You ask for Xuezi&#x2019;s aid in stopping him and Yang Xue. With her powers unsealed, she may even be a match for Yang Xue, allowing you to turn the tide through the advantage of numbers.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You let Zhang Manxing go. It is probably too risky for your companions to prosecute the battle any further; you will just have to use the time until the Summit to train and figure out a plan to overcome Zhang Manxing. Whether it is in cooperation with the orthodox pugilists, or through your own connections with the unorthodox side, you will figure something out.

            <h3>八十三 · Showdown at Black Dragon Gate</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Showdown at Black Dragon Gate</b></span><br>
<br>
&#x201C;If that is your wish&#x2026;&#x201D; Xuezi&#x2019;s lips curl up in an unfriendly smile, and she closes her eyes. Her breathing slows down and she murmurs a strange chant under her breath. Her presence seems to expand outwards, engulfing you and everyone else in a calming field; you can sense a <i>qi </i>that is quiet on the surface yet bottomless beneath, like a placid lake hiding unfathomable depths. You begin to shiver. The temperature has plunged sharply; the falling rain turns to snow, floating gently to the earth. A gentle wind sweeps Xuezi off her feet. She hovers lightly in the air, using her now peerless <i>qinggong </i>to float upon the air currents. Her bound hair unravels, frosting over into icy white tresses. She opens her eyes, and waves her hand dismissively. At her command, a wall of cold, blue ice freezes into existence around the battlefield. The assorted pugilists present nervously back into each other, staring around them in awe and fear.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;W-what?&#x201D; Zhang Manxing looks around wildly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am sorry, boy, but there will be no escape for you today,&#x201D; says Xuezi, smiling nastily. &#x201C;You will die here. Try not to shit your pants when you do.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<i>I&#x2019;ll handle her, my son! </i><br>
<br>
Letting out a battle-cry, Yang Xue leaps at Xuezi, fangs bared and claws outstretched.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As the battle rages on, you spot Zhang Manxing attempting to run by himself &#x2013; he is burning his limbs in desperation while attempting to scale Xuezi&#x2019;s ice wall. Your master and the other pugilists still able to fight are assisting Xuezi in putting down the raging Yang Xue - he is proving to be a lot more trouble than any of you anticipated. Clutching your broken ribs, you head towards the fleeing Zhang.<br>
<br>
Bai Jiutian beats you to him, however. &#x201C;Zhang Manxing!&#x201D; she yells. &#x201C;What have you done to our <i>shifu </i>and <i>shimu</i>?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Bai hurls a sword at him, forcing Zhang to leap off the wall and land in front of her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nothing they didn&#x2019;t already deserve,&#x201D; he grins brokenly. &#x201C;What is it to you? You should rejoice!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will end your wretched life today,&#x201D; growls Bai, drawing another sword and moving in. Zhang mutters a curse as he prepares to fight. The two of them begin to exchange moves, but it is clear that Bai Jiutian is not in the best condition after being wounded by Yang Xue and donating a considerable amount of her inner strength to the spear clash. Even though Zhang Manxing is not exactly unscathed at the moment, his ludicrous vitality and newfound skill gives him the upper hand over her.<br>
<br>
You mutter a curse and join the fight, blocking a strike that would have wounded Bai. She seems just as surprised as Zhang to see you assist her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why are you interfering, Xu Jing?&#x201D; cries out Zhang Manxing.<br>
<br>
You block his blow and return a kick, pushing him back. The effort makes you wince, but you try to hold back the urge to scream in pain. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re an easy target, that&#x2019;s why,&#x201D; you call out. &#x201C;How many times do I have to reject your advances until you get the idea?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Fool on me!&#x201D; Zhang Manxing rages. &#x201C;I was a fool to believe that fatuous pretender when he said you would cooperate with me! No more mercy&#x2026; I will strike you down here and now!&#x201D; A strong wave of <i>qi </i>bursts forth from Zhang &#x2013; he had still been leaving something in reserve.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Watch out!&#x201D; Bai Jiutian shouts out a warning and tries to intercept Zhang Manxing, but she is too late. His sudden surge of speed catches the both of you, already weary and exhausted from the previous battle, by total surprise. He kicks Bai aside, his foot whipping across her neck with a painful crack. At the same time, he turns, evading your claws, and charges into you. A sharp pain spreads throughout your abdomen as he rams the sharpened bone of his crippled arm deep into you. You cough up blood &#x2013; Zhang Manxing twists his arm savagely, attempting to push in further and gouge out your innards.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Die die die die die die-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
His insane screams are replaced by one of pain. Three needles have sprouted on his eyeball &#x2013; looking over your shoulder, you see Cao&#x2019;er crouched down low behind a far rock. She is shouting something that you cannot hear from this distance.<br>
<br>
You are not about to waste this opportunity she has given you. Summoning up the last of your strength, you reach up and grab the arm impaling you &#x2013; you squeeze as hard as you can, feeling his bones splinter beneath your grip. His screams and curses double in intensity. Then, with your other hand, you claw out his throat. A dark red wound opens across his neck. Zhang Manxing stumbles back, gurgling blood. There is confusion in his eyes. He opens his mouth wordlessly as all the colour drains from his disfigured face, his fingers clutching at his throat as he attempts futilely to stem the life spilling away from his throat.<br>
<br>
He takes one step back.<br>
<br>
Then a second.<br>
<br>
And finally, he collapses.<br>
<br>
You let out the breath that you had been holding in, sinking to your knees from the pain.<br>
<br>
<i>MY SON!</i><br>
<br>
A loud scream cracks the ice wall. There is a tearing, ripping noise &#x2013; looking up with much effort, you see Yang Xue hurtling towards you at high speed, his eyes black with fury. He is missing an arm &#x2013; you note that it has been left behind, encased in ice and ensconced in Xuezi&#x2019;s grasp. In his desperation to reach who he thought to be his son, he had madly decided to give it up instead of tarry any longer. Thorny pillars of ice erupt from the earth to block Yang Xue&#x2019;s way, but his rage allows him to smash through them without stopping, regardless of the damage done to his body.<br>
<br>
Yang Xue reaches you with his old, withered body bleeding from a hundred wounds, half-frozen and mutilated.<br>
<br>
Of course, you are in no condition to evade his ferocious strike. His fist lands home, smack dab in the middle of your torso. You feel every bone in your body break.<br>
<br>
Everything goes black.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

            <h3>一 · The First and Last Lie</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The First and Last Lie</span></b><br>
<br>
It is another bright, sunny day on Maniac Island. The trees sway gently as you finish your morning workout. Your recovery had taken many months to accomplish &#x2013; if Cao&#x2019;er had not been nearby to begin emergency procedures, you would not have made it at all. Still, you are finally confident that you have surpassed your previous level.<br>
<br>
Well, it is not like there is anything you can freely use your strength for nowadays. The furore over the manuals died off with the passing of the previous masters at Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s poisonous hands. With Bai Jiutian, Song Lingshu, Liu Qi and Su Liaojing taking over the leadership of their respective sects, the new generation of orthodox pugilists were led by somewhat friendlier influences.<br>
<br>
The Jiuyin Manual had disappeared with Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s corpse, and the Jiuyang Manual had been burnt into ashes together with the leaders of the Zhang clan. The Wuxiang Qiankun scrolls were still kept safely at the Fire Temple, guarded by your subordinates. No one dared make a move on them, though you are considering destroying the writings for good in order to prevent any bloodshed from sweeping the <i>jianghu </i>ever again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Darling.&#x201D; While you are wiping your sweat, Qilin approaches you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you sure you should be walking about?&#x201D; You gesture at her swollen belly wryly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m the Western Vixen after all, one of the Greats,&#x201D; she smiles mischievously. &#x201C;My martial arts can take this level of strain, and so can our child. No problem.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You had been too injured to attend the Huashan Summit even though it had been delayed after the fierce fighting at Black Dragon Gate. You were not the only pugilist to miss it, however.<br>
<br>
The Amesha Spenta refused to participate; Vahista had insisted, in between hiccups, that it would be improper for them to do anything of the sort if you did not lead them there. Your master declined to show up, saying that he had nothing to prove there and it would be a waste of his time. The Sword Saint said that he would pass &#x2013; he would have been one of the favourites even with one arm, but he had decided to leave things to the younger generation. Murong Yandi had participated in his master&#x2019;s stead, and won the title of the Northern Swordmaster. Fangci, the Abbot of Shaolin, had easily claimed the spot of Eastern Monk, while Guo Fu represented Wudang bravely and is now known as the Southern Mountain. Bai Jiutian had demonstrated skills that surpassed them all, claiming the title of the Central Hero.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I could have beaten you if you hadn&#x2019;t cheated,&#x201D; scowls Yunzi, appearing to join the both of you. Her belly is as bulging as Qilin&#x2019;s. She had tried participating in the Huashan Summit, but Qilin had been too cunning in the end.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You tried cheating first,&#x201D; says Qilin calmly, though she does not hide the slyness of her grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yunzi, how are you feeling?&#x201D; you say quickly, attempting to defuse the situation. Although you had finally managed to reconcile your separate responsibilities to the Fire Cult and the Wudu Cult, there is still some lingering tension that you have learnt to watch out for. &#x201C;I know the Ashina have been clamouring for you to be in a traditional tent.&#x201D; The scattered Ashina tribe had finally been gathered together again &#x2013; they were now living off the lands around the Fire Temple, and becoming strong.<br>
<br>
Yunzi tosses her head back. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll give birth wherever I want to, even if it is on the back of a horse. It&#x2019;s alright, they&#x2019;ll understand the moment I show them the baby. Anyway, you did have something to pass on, didn&#x2019;t you, Qilin?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, right. It&#x2019;s a message from the palace.&#x201D; Qilin brings out a letter bearing the Emperor&#x2019;s own seal. It is already broken. &#x201C;I read it already. Your friend wants to meet you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You take the letter, shaking your head. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t seem happy about it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;<i>We </i>aren&#x2019;t happy about it,&#x201D; snorts Yunzi. &#x201C;Do we need to explain it again?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Look, there&#x2019;s no need to get jealous of the Emperor. He&#x2019;s the <i>Emperor</i>,&#x201D; you say patiently, escorting them back to the mansion. The three of you pass by the friendly old gardener, who beams and bows at your approach. &#x201C;Well, that was an Emperor too,&#x201D; you mutter softly as you enter the house. Master Zhang has embarked on a journey to the west, leaving the place in your care for the time being&#x2026; still, the place does not seem to feel as empty as you thought it would, considering the number of people now living here.<br>
<br>
You begin preparing for your trip off the island quickly; it has been a while since you met with Shun. After a while, Yifang comes in to help you pack.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How is Master Yao and the Abbess this morning?&#x201D; you ask. The two oldies had been given a little private hut a fair distance from the main building, where they could grow herbs and potter around in peace. Yifang has been busying herself being in charge of tidying up the mansion &#x2013; a momentous task, considering how Master Zhang liked to leave it.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They&#x2019;re doing fine,&#x201D; smiles the former nun. &#x201C;I heard that you are going to the capital?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. Do you want me to pick up anything for you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I did have a few things in mind,&#x201D; she beams. Her hand accidentally touches yours &#x2013; it lingers there for a moment before she draws it back quickly, blushing. &#x201C;S-sorry!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh and pat her on the head. &#x201C;Alright. Write what you need down on a list so that I don&#x2019;t forget.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Once everything is done, you say your goodbyes and leave the mansion, slinging your bundle of belongings over your back. On your way out, you spot Nie Shuixian teaching the Minamoto children letters and numbers. You wave to her, and she waves back brightly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you going somewhere, Xu Jing?&#x201D; she asks.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m headed for the capital,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;Anything you want picked up?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, not at the moment,&#x201D; she shakes her head.<br>
<br>
You look around. Her twin sister, Nie Mudan, is still not around. In the aftermath of the battle at the Black Dragon Society, losing their parents had hit Nie Mudan a lot harder than it did her sister&#x2026; she had ended up secluding herself from the world. You had asked if they would not return with Bai Jiutian to Huashan, but Shuixian had decided that it would help Mudan recover better if they stayed away from a place with so many memories.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My sister is still the same,&#x201D; says Shuixian sadly, shaking her head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;These things take time.&#x201D; You give her a commiserating smile. &#x201C;Take as much as you need, the island is open to you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nie Shuixian bows in thanks. As her head bobs back up, she says, &#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s right, I had something to say&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; You glance at her, and the girl turns slightly red.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;N-no, never mind. I think I&#x2019;ll tell you when you get back. Have a safe journey!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She bids you farewell and turns hurriedly back to the laughing kids, who are making whistling noises and jeering at her.<br>
<br>
Leaving the village, you continue on the well-trodden path towards the pier. As you round the corner, under a familiar tree, you hear footsteps behind you. Turning around, you see Cao&#x2019;er and Xuezi. The two of them have been spending a lot of time together lately &#x2013; Xuezi had told you that due to Yang Xue&#x2019;s power, the unsealing took a greater toll on her than she expected, and Cao&#x2019;er had to give her constant treatment. The child immortal &#x2013; no longer all that immortal &#x2013; doubts she will be able to use her powers again without seriously endangering herself. In return, she seems to have been imparting her skills to Cao&#x2019;er as repayment.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve heard,&#x201D; says Xuezi.<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er glares at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I-I was going to find and tell you before leaving,&#x201D; you say, your attempted laugh dying in your throat.<br>
<br>
She shakes her head. &#x201C;Never mind&#x2026; just come back as soon as you can&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are slightly surprised &#x2013; you thought that she would have demanded to go with you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Whatever comes next is something you must decide for yourself,&#x201D; says Xuezi. &#x201C;This is the time. You remember that you owe me a favour, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod. &#x201C;Calling it in?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I only ask that you do what you feel is right when you meet with your friend. That is all, brat.&#x201D; Leaving you with those words, Xuezi departs, walking back up the path to the island&#x2019;s interior. Cao&#x2019;er runs up and gives you a tight embrace, squeezing you as hard as she can, before doing the same.<br>
<br>
Shaking your head, you turn towards the boat. It&#x2019;s time to return to the mainland.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Chang&#x2019;an and the palace have changed a lot since the last time you were here. Yang Xue&#x2019;s mad rampage had laid waste to half of the city, killing thousands of innocents. Taking Zhang Manxing&#x2019;s corpse with him, Yang Xue had fled the Black Dragon Society. In his grief over Zhang&#x2019;s death he had blamed the Emperor for everything. Whether in his insane mind he thought it was Li Ming, or knew that this was his son, did not matter. The result was that he appeared in the capital shortly after the incident at Xiangyang and began destroying everything in sight as he slowly worked his way towards the throne. In the fight, Xiahou Yu had been grievously injured, and was now still recuperating in Yangzhou. Gao Ying&#x2026; had disappeared. No one knows whether he is still alive; there had been many victims who were outright pulverized into unidentifiable smears of flesh and blood by the mad ex-general. It was fair to assume that he was probably dead.<br>
<br>
You walk past the rebuilding city, and through the palace gates. Today was not a sunny day; the clouds are gathering overhead, and darkening. The palace itself seems a bit more heavily guarded than usual, but you chalk it up to heightened security after Yang Xue&#x2019;s invasion. You had heard that it was Shun himself that finally defeated the old man&#x2026; still, you could not know the truth for sure. At the time you were slipping in and out of a coma, your body still attempting to mend itself from your countless injuries.<br>
<br>
The guards open the gates to the throne room wordlessly, staring at you with stony eyes. You flip them an easy grin as you enter. They&#x2019;re just doing their job anyway.<br>
<br>
Inside, Shun is awaiting you. He is dressed in full imperial regalia &#x2013; the clothes certainly look like they weigh upon him. At his side is the Xuanyuan Sword - the real thing, clad in an ornate scabbard befitting an Emperor. The moment he sees you, his face breaks out into a wide smile, and he stands from his throne. &#x201C;Jing! It has been a while &#x2013; no, don&#x2019;t start bowing. There is no one in the hall to care anyway.&#x201D; He is right &#x2013; besides the two of you, and the guards outside, there is no one else present. No courtiers, no eunuchs. He beckons you to come closer, right up to the Dragon Throne, and you do. Shun moves aside, perching himself on one of the arms. He pats the other end of the wide throne, signaling at you to sit.<br>
<br>
You raise an eyebrow. &#x201C;Are you sure, Your Majesty?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter? When have <i>you </i>ever been scared of breaking palace etiquette? You used to sneak onto this little old chair all the time with me when Father was not around.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026; you&#x2019;re right,&#x201D; you laugh, and take your customary position besides your childhood friend.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, how have you been? Last I heard, you, uh&#x2026; have two kids on the way?&#x201D; asks Shun.<br>
<br>
You nod. &#x201C;I suppose so. Aren&#x2019;t you a father many times over already?&#x201D; You know that his harem is growing in size &#x2013; sometimes against his will. You have heard that even Zhang Minyue had become one of his concubines&#x2026; though that was more as a political hostage, in order to ensure the good behaviour of the surviving members of the Zhang clan. You wonder if she is somewhere in the palace at the moment. Shun had successfully pinned the fault for Yang Xue&#x2019;s rampage on the Zhang clan, and used that as an excuse for many executions.<br>
<br>
He scratches his head. &#x201C;I suppose so&#x2026; I lose track of how many concubines there are sometimes, not to mention the children. I need to get a tally done some day.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Better keep it in your pants, great Emperor. Sibling rivalries can be deadly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am well aware of that,&#x201D; he sighs. &#x201C;The life of an Emperor is really not all it is cracked up to be. I think I would trade it for the opportunity to go adventuring in an instant, if the world would let me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t as fun as you think it is &#x2013; I spend half my time lying in bed, recovering from wounds and missing limbs.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s because you never think before you leap,&#x201D; he laughs. &#x201C;But&#x2026; yes, it is impossible for me to put this all aside. I have my duty to the people and to the land. They are chains that I have put upon myself willingly, ones that I can never set aside.&#x201D; Shun&#x2019;s gaze turns serious, and he looks out across the grand hall. &#x201C;This was the first room to be rebuilt. I am sure you have seen the rest of the city.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You nod, and he continues.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would not like that to happen again.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure it won&#x2019;t. Yang Xue was an aberration.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;One that can emerge again as long as martial arts continue to be practiced freely.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You feel your heart freeze for a second. &#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You of all people should understand how dangerous it is. Remember when I sent you out into the world, all those years ago? Back then our concern was that the sects were involving themselves in politics, and that we would be unable to defeat them without a horrible bloodbath. As it turns out, our fears were warranted.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is less so now. The new generation of leaders are far more trustworthy than the last&#x2026; well, most of them are. We <i>won</i>.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The potential threat still exists. We cannot rely on their goodwill to <i>not </i>overthrow the palace and seek out power on their own. For the country to be stable, I have to concentrate the monopoly of force under one authority.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shun. This is crazy,&#x201D; you protest. &#x201C;What do you plan to do?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Destroy every martial arts manual in existence, and close down the sects. It is just that simple.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They will resist.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They will die.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shun!&#x201D; you shout, standing up from the throne.<br>
<br>
He looks at you apologetically, an embarrassed grin on his face. &#x201C;Sorry, did I take it too far? I didn&#x2019;t mean that at all. Look, let me explain. That is why I need you to help me with this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are you talking about now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have considerable influence with the sects at the moment. Everyone knows you, and even if they do not like you, they respect you. I need you to be my official right-hand man for this task, my emissary to the <i>jianghu</i>. Persuade them to lay down their arms and give up their martial arts. The process need not be sudden. It can be gradual. They just need to stop teaching, and let the art die a natural death. Jing, this is the most important thing I will ask of you. We <i>don&#x2019;t need </i>pugilists anymore&#x2026; in fact, they are only holding our advancement back, miring us in the past.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You are not certain what to think. Shun seems strangely genuine, and convinced that the country will be better off without martial arts. Still&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Something Zhang Manxing said flashes into your mind, for no discernible reason to you.<br>
<br>
You take a deep breath, and ask, &#x201C;Did you have any contact with Zhang Manxing before he died?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun seems slightly taken aback at the question. Then, he laughs. &#x201C;You wouldn&#x2019;t have asked that question if you didn&#x2019;t suspect anything. Well, we <i>are</i> best friends. Since you raised the issue, I won&#x2019;t hide it from you. Yes, I tried to get him to help you out.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
To wipe out the orthodox sects? Zhang Manxing had almost succeeded, if you and your companions did not stop him there. You wonder how long this has been going on. Staring at Shun, you ask coldly, suddenly, &#x201C;How long have you planned all this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He pauses for a long while, his eyes averted from you, before finally answering. &#x201C;&#x2026;from the start.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And if I do not agree to help you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Another long pause. He closes his eyes. &#x201C;&#x2026;what a foolish question. You know the answer, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; smiles the Emperor.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Even if you don&#x2019;t like it, Shun is right. Making sure the transition happens under your supervision is the best way to reduce any potential bloodshed. Fighting him won&#x2019;t do any good at all, both for you, the people you care for, and the country itself. You agree to help him.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You are going to beat the living shit out of Shun if you have to do it, to knock some blasted sense into his addled head. You are not sure what has suddenly gotten into him, but he must have gone utterly mad if he thinks you are going to stand by and let him act this way.

					<b>&#x5929;</b><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
So that is how it is. &#x201C;Can I be frank, Your Majesty?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Go ahead,&#x201D; he nods.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This idea is a big pile of shit.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun laughs heartily, slapping his thigh. &#x201C;Yes, that is what you would say, wouldn&#x2019;t you? <i>That</i> is just your style.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You glare at him. &#x201C;Shun, are you being serious about all of this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I thought that between the two of us, <i>I </i>was always the more serious one,&#x201D; he says, smiling. &#x201C;Yes, I will go ahead with this, with or without you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t allow you to do that, even if you are my Emperor.&#x201D; You will have to change his mind by any means necessary, and you will have to do it right now, before it is too late.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Really? How do you propose to stop me?&#x201D; grins Shun confidently.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not ruling out the option of beating you up until you realize how stupid you&#x2019;ve been,&#x201D; you say half-jokingly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Right,&#x201D; he chuckles. &#x201C;Except that won&#x2019;t be enough.&#x201D; The Emperor stands up to face you, his heavy robes swishing noisily. &#x201C;You will have to kill me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He is serious. You are at a loss for words. Just what <i>is </i>he thinking?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is what it will take to stop me. On the other hand, if you insist on getting in my way, you will be committing treason against the throne. The punishment will be commensurate to your crime.&#x201D; Shun&#x2019;s words are calm and measured, his stare unflinching.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What, are you going to throw me to the pigs?&#x201D; you snarl. This is going too far, even coming from him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not my father. I will see to it personally that your death is quick. For old times&#x2019; sake.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And you are going to do it with&#x2026; what, your army of millions? I hope they are going to fit in this hall, because I&#x2019;m not leaving until you change your mind.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My mind will not be changed. Will yours change?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not. You&#x2019;re giving me pretty poor incentive for this particular task.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So&#x2026; that is it, then. The dance of words will wind down, followed by a dance of swords. I wished it could have gone on a bit longer, but perhaps I am just naively delaying the inevitable.&#x201D; Shun backs away from you, his face set in a mask of stone.<br>
<br>
You try one more time to talk to him. &#x201C;Shun-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
He strikes out at you without warning.<br>
<br>
Your reflexes kick into action. Raising your forearm, you deflect his palm, using Taiji Fist to circulate the momentum to your advantage. You temporarily pull him off balance; seizing the opportunity, you retaliate with a punch to his abdomen, seeking to disable him before the fight goes any further. Shun makes his counter-move swiftly, gently nudging your fist aside before you can land a blow.<br>
<br>
He is using Taiji against you.<br>
<br>
You do not panic; you are certain you have more experience in actual combat than Shun does. Changing your beat, you unleash a rapid flurry of claws &#x2013; if he cannot perceive it, he cannot deflect it. Facing the relentless assault, he chooses to leap back and get some distance between the both of you. You make full use of the opening created. Stretching your hands out, you throw countless strings of spider silk at Shun. With a twist of your fingers you wrap them around him, binding and restricting his movement. It&#x2019;s over. You close the gap in an instant and put your wodao to his neck.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well?&#x201D; he asks, when you have not made any further move after several seconds. &#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you going to kill me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just showing off how much better I am at this,&#x201D; you smirk. Perhaps now he&#x2019;ll understand. &#x201C;Look, you should know by now that what you&#x2019;re planning is silly. You can&#x2019;t even beat me&#x2026; how do you expect to bring the <i>jianghu </i>to heel without disrupting the stability of the country?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun sighs.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, your instincts scream danger. You hop backwards, putting a far distance between you and Shun. The silk you had used to bind him begin to smoulder, and burst into flames shortly after. An immense <i>yang qi</i> emanates from Shun, as radiant as the afternoon sun. He begins walking towards you, his robes catching aflame and falling away in withered ashes behind him as he approaches, revealing a light suit of golden armour underneath. With his right hand he draws the Xuanyuan Sword &#x2013; the aura of power is palpable even from here.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Careful now,&#x201D; grins Shun. He charges at you, his <i>qinggong </i>granting him blazing speed. You have little time to react. The Xuanyuan Sword cleaves through the air and your wodao with equal ease; you toss the useless hilt at him and roll to the side, barely avoiding the Xuanyuan Sword as it sinks into the polished stone floor just inches away from your body.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Whoa, are you <i>actually</i> trying to kill me?&#x201D; you shout.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I rather thought that was the whole point, really,&#x201D; Shun responds. &#x201C;Weren&#x2019;t you listening?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He <i>is </i>serious. Getting to your feet, you turn and grab one of the luxurious tapestries hanging from the pillar near you. Ripping it away, you hurl the long piece of cloth at Shun. The Xuanyuan Sword flashes as it cuts through the cloth &#x2013; as it falls away from his sight, you are already upon him, lashing out with a burst of kicks. What you strike is not the Emperor&#x2019;s body, however, but a wall of dark <i>yin qi</i> raised at the last second. A pulse of darkness engulfs the Xuanyuan Sword &#x2013; it swings in almost imperceptible arcs that restrict your motion before you can safely withdraw. Shun does not waste any time in following up &#x2013; his palm shoots towards you instantly. A lance of <i>yang </i>qi explodes through your body, sending you hurtling down the long steps to the throne dais.<br>
<br>
You roll to your feet, spitting out the blood rising at the back of your throat. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; Shun affirms your realization, walking down the steps leisurely, wielding light and darkness in equal measure. &#x201C;Xuanming Jiuyin. Xiaoming Jiuyang. Wuxiang Qiankun. I have mastered all three.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know I taught you Wuxiang Qiankun&#x2026; and you could have obtained a copy of the Jiuyang manual before it was stolen by the Zhang clan&#x2026; but where did you get the Jiuyin skills? From Yang Xue?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun laughs and shakes his head. &#x201C;I suppose you could say that it just&#x2026; fell into my hands. Luck? Fate? Heaven&#x2019;s will, perhaps?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;When have <i>you </i>believed in Heaven&#x2019;s will?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He does not answer. Instead, he points at you with two fingers.<br>
<br>
You dart aside just in time as an explosion shatters the stone where you have been. Shun is upon you immediately, swinging the Xuanyuan Sword down upon your head. You draw the Chixiao Sword. The copper edge of his blade is stopped by your crimson sword &#x2013; a small shockwave is created by the clash, sending the tapestries fluttering noisily.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Look at you, Shun,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;All that talk about stamping out martial arts, but in the end you turn out to be using it yourself. If that isn&#x2019;t hypocrisy, I&#x2019;m a monkey&#x2019;s uncle.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Funny, I happen to know that you have a nephew that looks remarkably like one,&#x201D; he chuckles, forcing you back with both hands.<br>
<br>
You kick off the ground, pushing Shun away with a mighty swing of your sword. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t suppose you fathered him? That would explain the resemblance!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Shun lets out a chuckle of amusement, taking two steps back before darting forward again. The two Great Swords clash another time, and the pillars tremble. &#x201C;Well, if you had a sister, I would have made her my Empress! But&#x2026; to answer your accusation, I did say that I needed to concentrate all power in my hands. I will use every tool I have to achieve that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can achieve the same by just putting the sects under your direct control instead of disbanding them,&#x201D; you argue. Your feet are sliding back under the overwhelming force of the Xuanyuan Sword, and you redouble your effort. &#x201C;Have them work for you, instead of against you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And what after I am gone? What guarantee do I have that such strength is never abused? Better to do away with such a structure while I am still able.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This <i>will </i>weaken the country, and you know it!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A short-term pain in exchange for future stability. Suffer now, for the sake of lasting peace later... You don&#x2019;t know what I have foreseen.&#x201D; Concentrating his <i>qi</i>, Shun shouts out. A surge of <i>yin </i>and <i>yang </i>energy drives you back, swallowing up the floor in darkness and flames. You hop away, cutting apart the shadows reaching out for you with the Chixiao Sword. Too late, you realize that with the distraction of that move, Shun has managed to circle behind you unseen. You whirl around, managing to deflect the Xuanyuan Sword in the nick of time. However, you are unable to prevent him from landing a strike with a <i>yin</i>-infused palm. You pull together a hasty block, but the force behind his attack is still sufficient to smash you away, through the main doors of the throne hall and out into the courtyard.<br>
<br>
It looks like the rain has started pouring while you were facing Shun inside. You tumble, roll, and manage to bounce to your feet, almost skidding on the wet, slippery flagstones. Instantly, you find yourself surrounded by Imperial soldiers. Shouting out, they make an attempt to attack you with their spears and swords. Kicking off the shield of one soldier and grabbing the spear of another, you whirl around, lashing out swiftly in a lightning-fast attack. By the time you land on the ground again, more than ten soldiers have been downed, and the remaining ones still standing have backed away to a safer distance, their feet slipping in the rain. There is a whistling in the air &#x2013; a hail of arrows falls upon you. You crouch down and tear a leather cloak from one of the soldiers. Swirling it around, you deflect or break the arrows with the cloak before pulling it over your shoulders in one swift movement.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was only joking about the army, you know? It looks like you <i>really </i>don&#x2019;t want to let me go, do you?&#x201D; you shout towards the throne hall. To have summoned so many soldiers here, he must have been intent on forcing a decision from you. Still, you don&#x2019;t think you would have any problems escaping them. The problem lies with Shun.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Our eyes no longer see the same world, Jing. Only one of us is leaving this place alive,&#x201D; replies Shun, standing regally at its entrance. The soldiers fall to their knees at the sight of him. Descending the steps, he gives them a firm order, &#x201C;Pull back. Leave him to me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Standing tall in the torrential downpour, you face the invincible Emperor of the Tang, spear in your left hand and sword in your right. The small army in the square have fallen back, lining the grounds and the walls as they bang their shields in synchronization.<br>
<br>
Shun walks towards you, unheeding the rain &#x2013; the water sizzles and dances away from him; not a drop of it gets through, and he arrives in front of you entirely dry, glowing with an almost divine radiance.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;When did you plan all of this?&#x201D; you ask again.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;it does not matter anymore how it all started. What matters is how it is going to end.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You know that if you do not fight with all your strength here, you will die.<br>
<br>
The wind begins to howl.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will rely mainly on your sublime swordsmanship and the Great Swords that you have to carry you through the battle. This is the best way for you to counter the powerful Xuanyuan Sword - something seems suspicious about that blade, and perhaps if you can disarm Shun things may change.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You focus on a defensive battle, utilizing Taiji and your Xianglong Palms as the cornerstone of your strategy. If you hold out for long enough, there may yet be a chance for you to change Shun&#x2019;s mind - more importantly, getting severely injured here would be extremely counterproductive even if you win.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You attempt to copy Shun&#x2019;s Wuxiang Qiankun using your own Wuxiang Qiankun. From there, you might be able to progress to imitating the other legendary techniques he has mastered&#x2026; theoretically. Shun is right: only one of you will walk away, and you will need to push your limits here.

            </a>
            
					



					<b>&#x5730;</b><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Shun makes the first move. His Xuanyuan Sword splits sky and ground with a single swing &#x2013; although you raise the Chixiao Sword to block his attack, his sword <i>qi </i>propels you backwards, skidding through the rain. Leaping after you, he raises his arm for another attack. You side-step deftly, circling around Shun while you trace a larger field around you with your sword. He spins, following up with a powerful slash aimed at your neck. You lean back ever so slightly, intercepting his sword with your own. A path of gentle guidance &#x2013; your <i>qi </i>flows with, and not against, his blade. It works, but not as well as you had hoped: there is just too much power behind the Xuanyuan Sword for you to redirect effortlessly. You are knocked back a step while deflecting the attack. Shun regains his balance quickly, the shadowy Jiuyin <i>qinggong </i>righting him with ease. Wasting no time, he charges forward, closing the distance enough for him to attack with his palm techniques before you can recover. A one-two combination of the Jiuyin and Jiuyang palm techniques fly towards you; you manage to neutralize his initial attack with your own Xianglong Palms, but the follow-up strike smashes past your guard and sends a wave of pain shooting up your arm.<br>
<br>
You fall back, cradling your wounded limb. At that instant, a blinding, scorching light fills your vision. Only your instincts save you from being incinerated &#x2013; you throw yourself to the ground, feeling the intense heat singe your neck. Knowing Shun, he isn&#x2019;t going to end his attack here. You push off of the ground and sprint at him; dark shadows engulf the spot where you had been, missing your feet by mere inches. It looks like the recovery time for these powerful attacks is not instant &#x2013; Shun has barely pulled his arm back from the stance when you reach him. You thrust out with the spear in your hand. At the last second, a wall of dark <i>qi </i>stops it in its tracks. Sparks fly &#x2013; remembering vaguely what Master Zhang did in his duel with Yang Xue, you summon forth your internal energy in a massive, swirling spiral, and stab forward with all your might. The spear cracks, but it succeeds in piercing through the wall. As the spear-point hits the armour, it tears a ragged hole in the metal&#x2026; but it is then stopped by Shun&#x2019;s flesh.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You will not make a single scratch on me,&#x201D; he smirks.<br>
<br>
Shun roars. The spear shatters.<br>
<br>
He brings his Xuanyuan Sword around to smite you, but you are ready for him. Drawing upon all of your skills and techniques with the sword, you unleash a chaotic, deadly dance that rivals the Sword Saint&#x2019;s moves. The raindrops are dispersed in a wide area by the speed of your attacks, the crimson blade moving so fast that it would seem nothing more than a streak of red to the onlookers. Your first attack skims Shun&#x2019;s cheek, drawing blood despite his protective <i>qi</i>.<br>
<br>
For a moment, he looks slightly concerned.<br>
<br>
Then, he reads every subsequent strike perfectly and counters it blow for blow, overpowering you with his far superior <i>neigong </i>and blocking your attacks expertly with the Xuanyuan Sword. His retaliation forces your guard wide open, and without mercy, he finishes with a slash that cuts deeply into your stomach.<br>
<br>
Staggering back, you leap away, taking to the stormy skies. Shun comes after you, whirling around in a flurry of kicks &#x2013; Yang Xue&#x2019;s Wuying Leipo moves &#x2013; and before you can react, smashes you hard in the chest. Falling away, you aim your trajectory towards the ornate roofs of the palace. Crashing into the clay tiles, you tumble across the surface and roll to your feet. The pain makes you wince &#x2013; you are losing too much blood from your wounds. If this goes on, you are in trouble... no, you<i> are</i> already in big trouble.<br>
<br>
Shun lands in front of you lightly, unperturbed by the wind and the rain. Lightning streaks across the sky accompanied by the rumble of thunder, as if heralding his arrival.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;After all that talk, is this all you are capable of?&#x201D; he asks, pointing at your half-dead body with the Xuanyuan Sword.<br>
<br>
You&#x2019;ll have to try to get rid of that sword once more. You close your eye and laugh. &#x201C;I thought I could go easy on you. You leave me no choice.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know every move you have, every technique you can bring to bear. None of it will work on me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You hold the Chixiao Sword at your side, breathing in deeply. Raising one hand, you beckon. &#x201C;Then come at me, brother.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He does so, with scorching light and smothering darkness. The powerful manifestations of <i>qi </i>rush towards you, promising painful destruction if you are so much as touched by it. On the brink of life and death, you hear a faint whisper in your own voice, and you understand what you must do.<br>
<br>
You <i>really </i>hope this works.<br>
<br>
Tearing off your eye-patch, you concentrate all of your internal energyinto the Chixiao Sword.<br>
<br>
The mastery of swordsmanship you have inherited from the Sword Saint&#x2019;s arm and song.<br>
<br>
The revolutions of the Tao that you have perceived from the Taiji skills.<br>
<br>
The quick and fluid attacks of the Minamoto school.<br>
<br>
The unpredictable and half-arsed swordsmanship of your youth.<br>
<br>
The elegant power and grace of the beggars&#x2019; dragon palms.<br>
<br>
The wild brutality of Master Zhang&#x2019;s claws.<br>
<br>
The soaring flight of Yang Xue&#x2019;s kicks.<br>
<br>
The line between order and chaos, where perfect balance and harmony is found.<br>
<br>
The understanding that form comes from formlessness.<br>
<br>
In your journey you have faced countless trials and tribulations &#x2013; what you are now is a reflection what you have experienced. Your martial arts is but a mirror held up to your life. If the mirror reflects nothing, then&#x2026;<br>
<br>
You are empty.<br>
<br>
The sword is all there is.<br>
<br>
Your eye snaps open. The spark of flame in your empty eye socket dances in excitement. The Chixiao Sword shivers, making a keening wail that pierces the roaring storm as you cut apart the <i>qi </i>that Shun has projected, leaving behind a void in the wake of your blade. Like an empty mirror that shows nothing at all, your sword dance is a reflection of nonexistence &#x2013; form returns to formlessness, and this is what you reduce the legendary techniques into. You dash across the slippery clay tiles, closing the gap between you and Shun, and he hurries to defend himself. Your swords clash once, then twice, and thrice. Each time, more of the roof is torn up. Each time, Shun loses more ground, despite wielding the Xuanyuan Sword. Then, on the fifteenth exchange, you slip past his defenses and nick his palm &#x2013; twisting your sword, you wrench the Xuanyuan Sword out of his grasp. It arcs into the air and lands heavily, sinking up to its guard in the roof.<br>
<br>
You stand still in the rain, gasping for breath &#x2013; your wounds are starting to make your head spin. Shun has his head cast downwards, unmoving.<br>
<br>
Did you do it? Was it the sword after all?<br>
<br>
Shun begins laughing, throwing his head back with wild abandon. &#x201C;Jing! You never fail to surprise me! I thought you would use Wuxiang Qiankun to raise yourself to my level, but it looks like you found another way of your own! That is just your style, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; Glancing at you from between his fingers, he grins. &#x201C;I was caught off guard... you should have killed me with that blow. I suppose you thought the sword was suspicious?&#x201D; His hand makes a grasping motion.<br>
<br>
You sense the danger, but your fatigue and injury makes you a bit too slow to react. Though you make the jump, the Xuanyuan Sword sinks into your thigh from behind, plucked out by what you now realize to be a targeted application of the Xixing Great Skill.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are only half-right,&#x201D; mutters Shun as he tears the sword out of your leg, sending you screaming to the ground in pain.  Gritting your teeth, you try to overcome the pain and concentrate enough to continue the fight. Shun raises the Xuanyuan Sword above his head, his eyes looking down upon you coldly.<br>
<br>
It looks like you truly have no other choice.<br>
<br>
Your grip tightens on the Chixiao Sword.<br>
<br>
You launch yourself at him, and the fight begins anew. This time, despite your wounds, the advantage is yours. Your new technique has in itself the answer to everything Shun can throw at you. Before your blade his Xuantiedun and Jiumingjia are akin to nothing &#x2013; you cut past his defenses with ease. His palm strikes are countered swiftly with the hilt of your sword, the movements that allow you to do so coming from within. His <i>neigong </i>is dissipated harmlessly, a mere reflection vanishing into infinite distance. You cut, and slash, and wound. Royal blood stains the rooftops, though he always manages to avoid the worst of it thanks to his skill and perception.<br>
<br>
But gradually, somehow, he begins to adapt to your blade. His responses become faster. Your attacks find their mark less and less. You redouble your effort, and he unleashes even more of his strength.<br>
<br>
Again, the two Great Swords clash, Chixiao and Xuanyuan. The shockwave blasts a hole in the weakened roof underneath the both of you, and you plummet into the throne room below. Even before you land the two of you are coming to blows. A second clash flings your respective swords away from your hands, but you do not really need it anymore &#x2013; at the highest level of understanding, the stance becomes one that can be performed with or without a sword. The <i>qi</i> emanating from Shun is now so intense that it sets the entire hall alight - wood, stone, cloth... all of it burns. With a wave of your hand, you blast away his attack with your own chaotic <i>qi </i>before it can harm you.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a bit too thrilling,&quot; says Shun sardonically. &quot;Do you now see why martial arts is too dangerous?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You&apos;re the one doing property damage to your own house. You only have yourself to blame.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ha! Perhaps,&quot; Shun shakes his head slowly. &quot;On a greater scale of things, that may be just as valid. Should a farmer burn his farm to the ground to rid it of pests?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You <i>do </i>know what your actions will bring, Shun. Why are you insisting on ruining your own empire?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Empire is doomed regardless of whatever I do, Jing. The best I can achieve is to guide it into a gentle death,&quot; he says, his eyes suddenly hollow. &quot;And if I have to sacrifice you to do that... then that is what I must do.&quot;<br>
<br>
You laugh mockingly and beckon to him with a single finger. &quot;I&apos;m not too sure Heaven is going to like the taste of me... but if you think you can actually get rid of me that easily, bring it on.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two of you charge at each other, exchanging blows that shake the entire palace.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When did it all begin?<br>
<br>
When Yang Xue went on a rampage in Chang&#x2019;an, striking the fear of martial artists into the hearts of many?<br>
<br>
When the Ten Swords Conference was called, and the Emperor obtained the sword of divinity?<br>
<br>
When the three legendary martial arts manuals reemerged into the world, starting a storm of bloodshed?<br>
<br>
When the Fire Cult battled the Eight Orthodox Sects at Heihu Valley, heralding the end of pugilism&#x2019;s golden age?<br>
<br>
When Li Shun ascended the throne successfully over the machinations of his siblings?<br>
<br>
When a prince&#x2019;s companion decided to wander the <i>jianghu</i> alone, to begin his long journey unfettered by the rules of orthodoxy?<br>
<br>
In the Tujue steppes, when a boy encountered a princess, and became embroiled in troubles far beyond his comprehension?<br>
<br>
With a mad Emperor&apos;s strange compulsion to purchase a peasant playmate for his heir?<br>
<br>
Or did it begin many thousands of years ago, an inescapable destiny rooted in the world when the earth and sky were still young, and fate was yet to be fully written in the stars?<br>
<br>
Your eyes open. Your head is spinning; you touch it tenderly, feeling blood gushing down your right temple where Shun&#x2019;s last blow had landed. Moving unsteadily forward, you grab your sword and drag your feet towards his fallen body. The timbers above you crackle with red flame; the expensive tapestries are being swallowed greedily by the fires of your battle with Shun. Before you can get close enough, he pulls himself upright. He looks shaken, and in as bad a condition as you are; his golden armour is cracked and falling apart, and his hair has come loose. Blood trickles down his face and lips &#x2013; there is a small pool of red gradually spreading at his feet, glinting darkly as it reflects the flames.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How much longer are you going to be stubborn?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have said this before. You are going to have to kill me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Your vision wavers again, blurring. You stumble. There seems to be a hazy visage in front of you&#x2026; the silhouette of a woman. You cannot make out her features clearly.<br>
<br>
<i>Your friend has been possessed.</i><br>
<br>
A voice rings out in your head; soft, gentle, comforting, convincing. You remember it &#x2013; Lady Ji.<br>
<br>
<i>There is a way to save him, if you are willing. </i><br>
<br>
You shake your head, trying to clear your sight.<br>
<br>
<i>Sacrifice yourself. Let the Emperor kill you. Your death will shatter the chains binding his mind, and allow him to think clearly at last. As the person he cares for the most, this will-</i><br>
<br>
Lady Ji&#x2019;s form scatters into nothingness as a sword pierces through the cloudy mist and stops just in front of your nose.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What are you doing there&#x2026; standing around gaping like an idiot? Haven&#x2019;t you learnt to pay attention in a fight?&#x201D; gasps Shun, the effort of raising his arm alone taxing his reserves. &#x201C;It would be an insult if you just rolled over and died here. If you are going to surrender your head, do it for the right reason. Not simply because someone tells you to.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Wondering if he saw and heard the ethereal woman or if it was just a coincidence, you raise your blade and knock his weapon aside. &#x201C;Hey. Don&#x2019;t point that thing at me if you don&#x2019;t have any intention of using it,&#x201D; you grin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Take a step closer and I&#x2019;ll show you just how much intention I have of using it,&#x201D; Shun chuckles, slumping backwards and taking a shaky stance.<br>
<br>
You do the same, staring into his eyes. His gaze is committed and firm. He has no intention of giving up &#x2013; he will see this farce through to its final page even if he has to die for it.<br>
<br>
All around you, burning wood and stone fall, vanishing into the roaring flames.<br>
<br>
No matter when it all began, the next choice you make will be the end.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Kill Shun. The land will be plunged into chaos; you are not under any illusions that there is anyone alive right now that can be a more competent administrator or figurehead than he is. What he plans to willfully do will tear the country apart anyway. Rather than allow him to madly taint his legacy, you will end his story here. You will be hated and reviled as the murderer of a hero, but regardless of what the world thinks, you have people to return to. People who rely on you, who will be saddened by your death. People that you do not want to part with. No matter what happens to the country, or even to the world, the only thing you wish for right now is to return to them, alive.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Let yourself be killed by Shun. The land will be plunged into chaos; you are not under any illusions that Qilin, Yunzi or Cao&#x2019;er will do nothing to avenge your death. The Wudu Cult will act, the Fire Temple will mobilize, and the Tujue tribes will ride. But Shun may yet be able to hold the country together competently in the face of such opposition &#x2013; he has the personal and political power to do so as long as he gives up on his notion of destroying the sects. If it takes your death to make him understand that, so be it. He may not be able to bring about lasting peace and stability, but he will still be able to minimize the suffering. Although it will be a long and arduous struggle for him, you will leave it in his more capable hands.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Pray. No matter how this ends, it is clear that Heaven has won. Given all that has transpired here, in the long run, the Tang will not last another generation even if Shun lives through today. This seems to be the result they desired all this while. Perhaps a direct appeal will get their attention&#x2026;

					<b>&#x4EBA;</b><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You look around in bewilderment. The dancing flames have become frozen, like red, motionless flowers. The air is deathly still. Shun is not moving &#x2013; a look of determination still remains in his eyes. A single sphere of blood is suspended in mid-air, on its way to the floor after dripping off his chin.<br>
<br>
You remember, in your desperation, making a heartfelt appeal to Heaven. Whether or not this was a situation of their doing, only divine intervention possessed the power to change the destiny of the Empire now. To save Shun, your loved ones, and yourself, this was the only path you could have taken.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do not be surprised, Xu Jing.&#x201D; A dark shadow slithers behind the pillars, circling you. &#x201C;Time in the mortal realm does not bind us in this single moment.&#x201D; The gentle whisper is now coming from behind you &#x2013; suddenly, a pair of slim, fair arms wrap themselves over your shoulders, and you feel something comfortable and soft push up against your back. Your instincts have not sensed her approach at all&#x2026; and for some reason, you find yourself unable to push her away.<br>
<br>
Like a rat paralyzed by the stare of a snake.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you&#x2026; a goddess?&#x201D; you ask, trying to move your head away from her soft, ticklish breath. With a light giggle, the presence behind you departs, leaving behind cold emptiness where she had once been. You turn your head to try and catch a glimpse of her, but the voice now comes from your front.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am Nuwa, creator of man.&#x201D; A beautiful woman garbed in celestial attire is now standing before you, her skin glowing softly with a gentle radiance. She walks towards you demurely, her hands clasped in front of her. &#x201C;I <i>am </i>a goddess, yes, and I have been watching over you since your birth. In the heavens, there is no god that cares more about you than I do, and I have waited a long, long time for you to seek my assistance.&#x201D; Nuwa smiles kindly, her eyes twinkling with benevolence&#x2026; and passion.<br>
<br>
You try to stifle a sudden surge of unease, and nod. &#x201C;That is quite flattering! Then, you should already know what I ask for, Lady Nuwa.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, I do.&#x201D; Nuwa casts a glance at the frozen Shun, and then turns her eyes back to you. &#x201C;Why do you care so much for a dynasty that is lived long past its due fate?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You shrug. &#x201C;My friend&#x2019;s the Emperor, and he&#x2019;s been doing a pretty good job thus far. If you omit a few weird decisions that he has made lately, that is.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah. That in itself won&#x2019;t be enough, I think.&#x201D; Sighing, Nuwa gives you a sad smile. &#x201C;The truth is, fate has been stretched <i>quite </i>far enough. If the Tang continue to distort their rightful destiny, a cataclysm of unimaginable proportions will strike both Heaven and Earth alike. You must understand, the gods have their hands tied in this matter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean that Heaven is helpless? I am terribly sorry to bother you then,&#x201D; you say flatly, your eyebrows arched.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No!&#x201D; Perhaps you are imagining it, but a dark, terrible void passes behind Nuwa&#x2019;s eyes for an instant. The goddess shakes her pretty head. &#x201C;I mean, no, not at all,&#x201D; she says, her eyes now shining with even more compassion for your predicament. &#x201C;Heaven has its ways. The rise of a new dynasty, with the favour of Heaven&#x2026; that is a way of averting a catastrophe. In fact, I do believe that you are the best candidate for the job.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You mean&#x2026; that I become the new Emperor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nuwa nods happily. &#x201C;Yes, Jing. If you would seek to rule, I can grant you Heaven&#x2019;s blessing. All I ask is that you whole-heartedly acknowledge me as your one and only goddess, in gratitude for this favour.&#x201D; After pausing for a while, she frowns, &#x201C;Of course, the blood of the previous dynasty must be expunged for their crimes against the order of Heaven. You <i>would </i>have to end your friend&#x2019;s life with your own hands to show that you deserve the right to rule. I am sorry, but that is the way it works.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You glance at Shun. Your fists tighten reflexively. &#x201C;Is that the only way?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x201D; Nuwa steps closer to you, close enough that you can smell her enthralling fragrance. &#x201C;There is <i>one </i>other way. If you are willing to join me in Heaven, I might be able to help the Tang Emperor maintain his domain for a few more generations yet.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Do you mean that you want me to become your ally?&#x201D; you ask, slightly suspicious.<br>
<br>
Nuwa fidgets a little, and you swear that you can see a faint blush on her cheeks. &#x201C;No, not exactly. I&#x2026; I need a consort to work with. I think you are a <i>very </i>interesting and talented mortal, Jing. As a deity, you would be very capable in assisting me to reshape the world into a better one. And of course&#x2026; we could&#x2026;&#x201D; Her voice trails off and she looks away shyly.<br>
<br>
You breath in deeply. This is all too new to you. &#x201C;Are these the only options I have?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes. These are the <i>only two</i> <i>choices</i> that you have.&#x201D; There seems to be a slight flicker of annoyance in her voice, though you cannot be sure.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You will acknowledge Nuwa as your only goddess, and swear your fealty, worship and adoration to her for the rest of your life. In return, you will become the new Emperor, supplanting the Tang dynasty, thus bringing prosperity and averting calamity.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You will become Nuwa&#x2019;s consort, and work with her to make the world a better place. A chance at not just immortality, but becoming a deity, is too good to pass up. It will mean leaving behind all you care about, but you will ensure it is left in good hands from your perch in the heavens.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>You cannot accept either of these two options. You try to propose a third one, although you sense that it may not be wise to anger the goddess or to push your luck too far&#x2026; (make your own proposal)<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>Somehow, you are getting a vague feeling that Nuwa cannot be fully trusted regardless of what you try to say to her. You reject the goddess&apos;s offer of divine intervention. Appealing to Heaven was a mistake and a waste of time in the first place.

            <h3>五 · Beyond the Three Realms</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Beyond the Three Realms</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I only have <i>two </i>choices?&#x201D; you repeat.<br>
<br>
A tiny little scowl flits across Nuwa&#x2019;s lips. &#x201C;That is what I said, Jing. Is it not enough for you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You make a show of scratching your head and looking apologetic. &#x201C;To be honest, they aren&#x2019;t very good choices.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Nuwa&#x2019;s eyes narrow into slits. &#x201C;This is a favour from Heaven! Men would and have killed for such opportunities!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, come on, <i>Lady </i>Nuwa! You have been watching me from the start, right? Then you would know that when someone says one, I say two. When someone says the sky is blue, <i>obviously </i>it&#x2019;s green. Can a man be both a tiger and a pig? Why not all three?&#x201D; You laugh uncontrollably, throwing your head back in amusement.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing, is this the attitude of someone seeking help from the gods?&#x201D; warns Nuwa politely.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, this is the attitude of someone dismissing the gods,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;Look, since you know me so well, you <i>should </i>understand the type of help I need. Why did you even bother showing up with some lousy offer, my dear goddess? Wait, you didn&#x2019;t have any ulterior motive coming to me, did you? I&#x2019;d be so disappointed. That would not be very godly behaviour.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Xu Jing&#x2026;&#x201D; The world trembles with her rage; the endless void reappears behind Nuwa&#x2019;s eyes as she glares at you. Her visage flickers once, seamlessly transforming into her divine appearance. Nuwa&#x2019;s ornate garb of sheer cloth billows out from behind her, a giant snake tail uncurling itself into existence from nowhere. Celestial markings form on her face, as if drawn on by an invisible brush, and begin glowing with power. Her kindly demeanour falls away, leaving behind the cold and terrible fa&#xE7;ade of a merciless goddess. &#x201C;You have <i>always </i>been like this! Can you not be humble for once? Would it kill you to do so?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, you know how it is. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if it actually would,&#x201D; you chuckle, trying to hide your nervousness. You wonder if you did the right thing, inciting Nuwa&#x2019;s anger like this with no real plan&#x2026; still, not only is the thought of bending a knee to the goddess unpalatable to you, from the time you met her there has been a niggling whisper in your mind urging you not to trust Nuwa&#x2019;s promises; that the moment you do so, your fate would be sealed. Winking at her, you say, &#x201C;Besides, you know that&#x2019;s why you like me enough to watch over me in the first place.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
That seems to make her even angrier, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are such an unthinking idiot, Xu Jing! We gave you brains to think, not to rebel mindlessly!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;If I&#x2019;m an idiot, what does that make <i>you</i>, all-powerful goddess who spends all her time watching an idiot?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2026; you&#x2026;! I was so close&#x2026; I will not let you slip through my grasp this time! You will be kissing my feet before you know it!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What? You don&#x2019;t even <i>have </i>feet at the moment! Look at yourself; you only have a giant, fat tail!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;did you just call me fat?&#x201D;  The air turns a freezing cold as she glares at you. You find yourself unable to move at all, and the sheer insignificance of your mote-like presence before her divinity hits you with full force.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait, no, I didn&#x2019;t mean it in a bad way, I happen to think your tail is absolutely beautiful!&#x201D; you call out, trying to free yourself from her bindings but to no avail. Your muscles just refuse to move. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d love to touch it!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will make you mine, even if it breaks your mind so <i>utterly</i> that you will never recover&#x2026;&#x201D; hisses Nuwa, slithering towards you. A terrible hostile intent, far more terrifying than anything you have ever felt in your life &#x2013; though strangely familiar &#x2013; engulfs you.<br>
<br>
This may be bad.<br>
<br>
The spark of flame within your eye socket roars to life &#x2013; somehow, it appears to have been awakened by Nuwa&#x2019;s hostility, reacting to it out of some unfathomable drive nestled deep within your being. Pure white fire bursts out of your eye, slowly spreading across your face. Slowly, gradually, the frozen flames currently burning the throne hall around you begin wavering. Time seems to be returning.<br>
<br>
Nuwa appears to be as surprised as you are at this development. &#x201C;It is trying to put you out of my grasp. I will not let that happen&#x2026; I cannot.&#x201D; A mad expression forms on her face. &#x201C;If that is the case, I would rather banish your soul from the cycle of rebirth for eternity!&#x201D; The white fire has  continued to slowly engulf your body, bit by bit. Holding out her hand, Nuwa begins chanting an incantation. A primordial darkness forms at her fingertips, overpowering the light of the sacred fire &#x2013; you sense that if she is to reach out and touch you, her threat would come true, regardless of any protection that the Eternal Flame can offer.<br>
<br>
Yet, you are unable to move.<br>
<br>
Nuwa&#x2019;s fingers stretch out towards you, her beautiful face distorted in an expression of insane glee.<br>
<br>
 &#x201C;Jing!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You feel yourself being shoved aside. Still frozen, you tumble to the floor. The roaring of the flames around you assail your ears; time has already snapped back to normal.<br>
<br>
Above you, Shun stands in Nuwa&#x2019;s way. The Xuanyuan Sword is embedded in her abdomen. She looks down at it in surprise. &quot;H-how did you...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The designs of mortals are not for Celestial ears,&quot; laughs Shun weakly.<br>
<br>
Glaring at you tearfully, Nuwa disperses into a sea of glowing spheres that dissipate into thin air. The Xuanyuan Sword clatters to the ground, left behind in her disappearance.<br>
<br>
Nuwa&#x2019;s last words echo in your head.<br>
<br>
<i>Xu Jing&#x2026; I won&#x2019;t forget this&#x2026;</i><br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shun. Did you just&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, what I scattered was just an avatar possessing a fragment of her power. I&#x2019;m&#x2026; glad I managed to move in time.&#x201D; Shun turns to face you. To your horror, you see an inky darkness spreading across his chest. He sees the expression on your face and shakes his head, chuckling. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. This is still a better resolution than I could have planned for. Well&#x2026; slightly better.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You will be banished forever, with no chance at reincarnation,&#x201D; you protest. &#x201C;How is that better?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The darkness crawls across his face, submerging his entire body. Shun smiles at you. &#x201C;If I can continue to remember the memories of our time as brothers, even eternity will not feel so long.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Finally, you manage to move your hand.<br>
<br>
You stretch out to grab Shun.<br>
<br>
The darkness swallows him fully, and he vanishes into a void folding in on itself.<br>
<br>
At the same time, the Eternal Flame engulfs you completely.<br>
<br>
You cry out as the world is flooded with a blinding white light.  <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Eight Sects</span></b><br>
<br>
In the years to come, the Eight Sects flourished under the guidance of its leaders. They remained a steady beacon of hope and stability in the chaotic world. Through it all there were ups and downs, and conflicts between the sects, but they managed to overcome their differences in the end. Still, all good things must come to an end, and when order eventually returned at long last, the need for their existence began to dwindle. This time, their diminishing influence would never recover. The decline was slow, spanning hundreds of years, but eventually the flying, soaring pugilists of yore were nothing but legends in the minds of the people&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Wudu Cult &amp; The Fire Temple</span></b><br>
<br>
Brought together by the influence of Xu Jing, under the leadership of Chi Qilin and Yunzi their ties would continue to grow closer. They did not take a prominent role in the turmoil immediately following the destruction of the palace in Chang&#x2019;an, but instead secluded themselves away from the world. There were some that hoped to pin the disappearance of the Emperor on them for political gains. They were invariably found very dead, and those who thought alike soon learnt to let sleeping dogs lie...<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Youxia City</span></b><br>

Youxia City, as always, remained Youxia City. In times of chaos it flourished, eventually blossoming into the largest city in the land. Then, it was burned down by invading Tujue horsemen. Of course, the strong-willed residents of Youxia would not let that deter them, and it was soon rebuilt &#x2013; this time with Tujue stalls joining the crowded streets&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Minamoto Clan</span></b><br>
<br>
Upon their return to their eastern lands, the Minamoto managed to triumph over their rivals thanks to Yorimitsu&#x2019;s leadership. He never forgot the time he spent in the Tang empire, and the people that he owed so greatly. Later, a grandson of his would become Shogun, and tales of Yorimitsu&#x2019;s exploits in lands both foreign and domestic would become legendary in Japan&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Yuhua Hall</span></b><br>
<br>
The most famous brothel in Yangzhou remained so through both good times and bad until an edict from a syphilitic, vengeful Emperor declared all brothels illegal. Though they had to close down, the entreprising women of Yuhua Hall parlayed their earnings into a successful business; they soon became one of the greatest merchant houses of Yangzhou instead&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ashina Tribe</span></b><br>
<br>
Having reformed thanks to their princess, they returned to the Tujue steppes years later under the leadership of their young Khan and united the squabbling tribes. This confederation, forged in both blood and friendship, would go on to become the foundation for one of the most powerful empires in the history of the world&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tufan Kingdom</span></b><br>
<br>
The troubles of their larger neighbour and ally meant that the Tufan Kingdom was no longer protected from the advances of the expansionist Lhasa Kingdom. Though Princess Rinchen and her consort, Jixuan Wuni, fought bravely, they were at last defeated and annexed into a greater Tibetan Empire. Their fate remains unknown &#x2013; some say that they were executed, others say that they managed to escape into exile, aided by a mysterious organization skilled in the arts of poison and war&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Imperial Court</span></b><br>
<br>
With the disappearance of Li Shun and the destruction of a good part of the Imperial Palace, the Tang Empire fell apart in the matter of weeks. Brother killed brother in a repeat of the last civil war&#x2026; this time, there would be no clear winner. The country dissolved into squabbling fiefdoms by the end of the first year, and there would be no peace to come for many, many years&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>Zuo Qingfeng &amp; You Lanhai</b><br>
<br>
The famous couple made an even greater name for themselves during the civil war, protecting peasants and eradicating evil. They said that they had a certain person to thank; though they had been in seclusion prior to this, this was their way of repaying him, by doing good wherever they went. Their children would grow up to become even more famous heroes&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Xiahou Yu</b><br>
<br>
Together with Liu Chanfeng and Xiaoqing, he wisely left the services of the court upon hearing of Shun&#x2019;s disappearance. He would live out his days happily as a scholar-for-hire in a more peaceful part of the land, penning letters for villagers and protecting them with intricate schemes pitting neighbouring warlords against one another&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Gao Ying</b><br>
<br>
Seeing the slow death of the dream he worked to achieve before his very eyes, the eunuch decided to retreat and reconsider his next move. He joined up with the former imperial constables, and together they began influencing the world from the shadows. Whether they brought about peace quicker, or if they hindered its coming, no one can say&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Xuxian</b><br>
<br>
In the quiet confines of Shaolin Temple, he drew upon his experiences in the world and the people he had met, and achieved an enlightened understanding of himself and his place in the world. When he was appointed Abbot, many decades later, it was rumoured that even the Shaolin Librarian bowed to him out of respect&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Guo Fu</b><br>
<br>
Guo Fu and his family remained steadfast through the times of troubles, guiding Wudang through the harsh environment. Thanks to his ability, the fame of Wudang grew by leap and bounds under his eventual leadership as Grandmaster. Guo Fu&#x2019;s understanding of Taiji was said to be second only to the mythical Wang Zhengchong &#x2013; he was deemed a legend in his own right. His descendants would later become famous generals&#x2026; and Emperors&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Qi Liuwu</b><br>
<br>
Surviving Black Dragon Gate and the civil war that broke out shortly after, Qi Liuwu lived out the rest of his life in peace as a trusted mentor to beggars young and old alike. He incorporated the Wuying Leipo Kick as one of the core techniques of the Beggars&#x2019; Sect, and it became their third signature technique behind the Xianglong Eighteen Palms and the Dog-Beating Stick&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Murong Yandi</b><br>
<br>
Though he spent a good part of his life under his teacher&#x2019;s shadow, he would later go on to make a name for himself, in his own right, as a righteous swordsman who wielded the Zhanlu Sword. In a feat of great legend, he sought out Zhang Minyue again, single-handedly rescuing her from the confines of the palace by defeating a thousand soldiers during the most turbulent period of the civil war&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Song Lingshu</b><br>
<br>
The sect leader of Qingcheng never forgot her time spent travelling with unorthodox rabble. Her leadership was unique, dynamic, interesting, and Qingcheng soon became one of the most popular sects by virtue of teachings and not money. Thanks to her, they became the sect most well-equipped to handle the transition into a new age. As for Lingshu herself, she never married, despite numerous proposals from the most eligible bachelors of the <i>jianghu</i>&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Nie Shuixian &amp; Nie Mudan</b><br>
<br>
The adopted daughters of Nie Wuxing devoted themselves to doing good in the world. After Xu Jing&#x2019;s disappearance, Nie Shuixian would later follow Chi Qilin and Yunzi into seclusion. Her twin, Nie Mudan, joined Song Lingshu&#x2019;s Qingcheng Sect and became her right-hand woman.<br>
<br>
<b>Bai Jiutian</b><br>
<br>
As the head of the orthodox world, Bai Jiutian was unparalleled in leadership or martial arts technique. However, a year after Xu Jing&#x2019;s disappearance, after performing great deeds that would lay down a secure foundation for the pugilistic world, she stepped down and vanished. Her reasons for doing so would only be known to her, though some say that she was feeling a great emptiness in her heart, and went on a journey in search of answers&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Yao Shunshi &amp; Abbess Miecao</b><br>
<br>
The two veterans of the <i>jianghu </i>lived their lives quietly on Yinhu Island, choosing to remain remote from the affairs of the world. When they eventually passed on, it was within seconds of each other&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Yifang</b><br>
<br>
The former nun cared for her grandparents as much as she could. After their passing, she rejoined Emei, and swiftly became one of its leading figures. She now found doubt in her heart as to her path, however, and within a few years she had left Emei again. No one knows where she went, though it is said that she sought out her twin sister&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Cao&#x2019;er</b><br>
<br>
With grim resolve upon learning of Xu Jing&#x2019;s disappearance, she became the sole inheritor of Xuezi&#x2019;s techniques. With Xuezi serving as her mentor, she would travel to the frozen north and claim leadership over the Xueguizi ruthlessly, becoming a name to be feared. Cao&#x2019;er used her immortal lifespan to search for Xu Jing through the centuries, believing that he was still alive out there&#x2026;<br>
<br>
<b>Chi Qilin &amp; Yunzi</b><br>
<br>
The first wives of the Fire Lord, Xu Jing, supported each other greatly in the aftermath of his disappearance. They never gave up hope that he was still alive. Under their leadership, the Wudu Cult and the Fire Temple grew closer together, and eventually merged into a single organization. Qilin&#x2019;s daughter and Yunzi&#x2019;s son would later go on to perform great deeds that outstripped that of their father in history&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The seagulls squawked, circling above the great blue ocean. Shangguan Chuji stood on the rocks, looking out at the vast expanse of water. He didn&#x2019;t have a good feeling about this &#x2013; there was no land to be seen at all on the horizon. Was there really a new world awaiting at the other end? Turning, he frowned at his travelling companion. &#x201C;Are you sure about this?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D; With one last shave from the edge of his palm, Zhang Jue finished the last log that would go into the raft. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m certain there is land out there, with new challenges to face and new sights to see.&#x201D; Looking up into the distance, he squinted under the bright sun.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure we brought enough food.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll just dive and fish, like we did in that southern sea.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What about water?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s what our <i>neigong </i>is for.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Sword Saint sighed. They were at the other end of the continent, having travelled &#x2013; and fought &#x2013; their way through strange lands and pale barbarians. It had been an adventure, the journey of a life time. Looking up into the distance, he squinted under the bright sun.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you searching for your disciple?&#x201D; asked Shangguan quietly, seeing Zhang Jue uncharacteristically lost in thought for once.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Of course not.&#x201D; The maniac grinned widely. &#x201C;If my stupid disciple is dead, then he was too weak to cut it. But if he is still alive, I do not need to search for him. I am his master.&#x201D; Standing up, he unfurled the raft&#x2019;s sail &#x2013; a patchwork of banners from the numerous knights and kings he had crushed on his way here.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I will leave behind a worthy legend for him to chase after.&#x201D;<br>

            <h3>Somewhere in the world...</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Another Epilogue</span></b><br>
<br>
The light subsides &#x2013; it is still bright, but no longer blinding. Your first thought is that you are drowning in softness; as if you are immersed in a lake of cotton. Desperately, you claw your way up; your eye snaps open in a panic.<br>
<br>
You find yourself staring at the ceiling. A bright circle of light hovers above you, attached to flat white tiles. It is a strange architecture that you have not seen before. You are in a room of some sort, lying on an extremely soft bed. Your senses are still blurry, your muscles unresponsive &#x2013; with some effort, you manage to get your head to move. You see a girl staring at you, dressed in a weird outfit.<br>
<br>
Yunzi?<br>
<br>
She walks over to you, concerned.<br>
<br>
Impulsively, you try to hug her.<br>
<br>
Yunzi screams as the sheets fall away, revealing your full nakedness. Turning red, she attempts to shove you away desperately.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;re being shy <i>now</i>, after what we did the last time?&#x201D; you laugh. Then, you pause. &#x201C;Wait, your belly is&#x2026;&#x201D; You place your hand under Yunzi&#x2019;s clothes, on her flat stomach, and she positively <i>shrieks</i>.<br>
<br>
There is a loud shout and a metal tray slams into your nose. The tray breaks, leaving you unharmed but bewildered, staring at the other girl that had just attacked you. Qilin. Yunzi runs and hides behind Qilin, babbling in a foreign language that you are certain is not Tujue.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is going on here? I don&#x2019;t really understand, but are the two of you playing a joke on me?&#x201D; you ask, but your questions are answered by a barrage of blows from Qilin, who is shouting in the strange tongue. Even if you have just newly awakened from your stupor, you still find her attacks easy to intercept. Has she lost her touch? You turn the tables quickly &#x2013; grabbing Qilin by the wrists, you push her down on the bed, straddling her.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on here?&#x201D; you demand. Things seem very wrong. Qilin blushes, and then scowls, before kneeing you in a place only the late Iron Shaft could defend. She rolls away from the bed while you are wincing from her well-aimed blow. She hurries to Yunzi&#x2019;s side &#x2013; the two of them whisper hurriedly, giving you dirty glances all the while.<br>
<br>
Then, the door opens. A similarly attired girl walks in, and <i>this </i>time it is Cao&#x2019;er, with her hair tied up in a bun and some sort of strange wires placed around her eyes. Qilin and Yunzi bow to her nervously while you stare in surprise at this unprecedented interaction between the three of them. Cao&#x2019;er tells them something and sends the two girls running off. Once they are gone, she locks the door and cautiously steps forward until she is standing right by your side.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is this a joke, or a dream, or one of Nuwa&#x2019;s pranks?&#x201D; you ask tentatively. If it is the latter, you will have to find some way out of it. Without warning, and breaking your train of thought entirely, Cao&#x2019;er throws her arms around you, burying her face in your bare chest. She is sobbing.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;&#x2026;Cao&#x2019;er?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Jing! Jing! Jing!&#x201D; She starts crying your name over and over again. You can do nothing but hold her close to you.<br>
<br>
It takes a long while before she composes herself enough to talk. &#x201C;I&#x2026; thought I would never see you again.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was worried about that too,&#x201D; you admit, &#x201C;but where am I? And what is wrong with Qilin and Yunzi?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x201D; She explains carefully.<br>
<br>
It seems that more than a thousand years have passed.<br>
<br>
And that the Qilin and Yunzi you saw are actually your descendants.<br>
<br>
Your face goes pale, realizing what you did. &#x201C;I&#x2026; I did that to my&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh&#x2026; don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; smiles Cao&#x2019;er wickedly. &#x201C;After so many generations, they are no more closely related to you than they are to any man you pick off the street. It is okay, Jing. They will grow to love you too. I am sure of it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You don&#x2019;t really think it is okay. It isn&apos;t... right?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But&#x2026; you are the same Cao&#x2019;er that I left behind, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Not exactly the same&#x2026; I think,&#x201D; she smiles sadly. And true enough, though her appearance young as the day you left her, there is a tired look in her eyes. She must have been through a lot this past thousand years, and all by herself too. You cannot resist patting her head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201D; you say. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all the same to me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The world-weariness seems to vanish from her gaze in an instant. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve missed that&#x2026;&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er beams.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, this means that you learned Xuezi&#x2019;s immortality, right?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Cao&#x2019;er nods. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been searching for you ever since. It was only recently that we discovered how the Eternal Flame could have possibly warped time and space&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Her explanation is full of words that you have never heard before, and you could barely follow it. Still, you understood the gist of what she thinks happened: to save you from Nuwa at that moment, the Eternal Flame sent you into the future. After centuries of searching Cao&#x2019;er finally managed to deduce what happened and where you would appear. It seems that she was right.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;What will you do now, Jing?&#x201D; Cao&#x2019;er asks, resting her head on your shoulders.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After listening to Cao&#x2019;er and understanding the situation you are in, you have come to a decision. Though this new world must be absolutely interesting to explore, there are three affairs in particular you would like to see through to the end.<br>
<br>
Three loose ends you would like to tie up.<br>
<br>
Free Shun from eternal banishment.<br>
<br>
Teach the gods a small lesson.<br>
<br>
Return to the time and place where you belong, to those that are waiting for you.<br>
<br>
Succeeding in any one task would be a deed great enough to go down in legend, but you are Man Tiger Pig, after all.<br>
<br>
Why settle for one, when you can do all three?
