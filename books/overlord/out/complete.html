            <h3>The Last Campfire</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Last Campfire</span></b><br>
<br>
The embers whirl and dance away, carried by the cold wind. Like the fire burning fiercely in the ring of stones, the chattering of your comrades is infused with warmth. Yet underneath their cheerful, carefree words, you can hear a tinge of uncertainty. It is not a mark against their courage: to have ventured this far into the Netherworld means that every single one of them possessed the courage of a hundred men. It is an uncertainty borne of the fact that the foe you must soon face is deadlier and stronger than anything you have ever fought. After all, they do not call him the Demon Lord for nothing.<br>
<br>
From his throne atop the black spire, the Demon Lord commands his legions of fiends to pillage and plunder the human world. He is a creature filled with the blackest malice, the embodiment of evil itself. In their time of need, man begged the skies for aid. The three goddesses that created the world and spun its fate answered man&#x2019;s call, and selected from their ranks a Hero. A champion of the light. The sword that would drive back the darkness.<br>
<br>
At least, that was how the prophecy went. High Priest Ardunnos at the Temple of the Fates had been quite adamant that his dream &#x2013; filled, unsurprisingly, with nubile maidens in sheer gossamer cloth attending to gorgeous goddesses &#x2013; was a prophecy from the gods. And so the Seven Kingdoms of Man had begun searching for a hero to save them: a champion that fulfilled the requirements of the Goddesses&#x2019; Prophecy. You remember the day that the emissaries came knocking at your door, the day when they revealed that you were one of the hero candidates.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>As a member of nobility, you had been accorded the best education that money could buy in both swordsmanship and magic. A life of luxury afforded you many benefits, and to your family&#x2019;s pleasure, they were not wasted on you. Your innate talent meant that you soon exceeded your peers, and as the war against the demons dragged on, it did not take long for hopeful eyes to turn towards you.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You were one of many to leave your struggling village for the capital, hoping to find a better life. There, against all odds, you were accepted into the famous Order of the White Falcon. They were an esteemed group of knights who had a long tradition of loyal service. You soon proved yourself as one of the best squires in the fortress, even besting some older knights in practice.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Your village was one of the first to be destroyed by the demon army. Orphaned at a young age, you were picked up by a band of roaming mercenaries. You spent your early years knowing only war, and nothing else. Thankfully, your luck turned for the better when you were bested by the greatest swordsman of the age.  Impressed by your skill, he spared you and made you his disciple.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>You lived the comfortable life of a merchant&#x2019;s son, but your interests had always been towards scholarly pursuits and less about the chase for money &#x2013; although you were no less talented in that field. Your family was kind and supportive, allowing you to take your own path. You did. You became the youngest graduate of the capital&#x2019;s most prestigious academy, and a skilled magical researcher in your own right.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You met the others soon after that, and you had been together since. A motley crew that had been full of conflicting egos and dysfunctional personalities at the start&#x2026; but the fires of battle have forged a bond that you have come to appreciate. You look at each of your friends in turn, while they sit around the campfire and talk.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;To be frank, I am not sure whether I dread the coming confrontation more, or its aftermath. As the leader of the Seven Kingdoms, my father will surely have me busy with the victory celebrations for months to come!&#x201D; jokes Kyle Theseon. The dashing young knight &#x2013; said by many be the most talented fighter in generations &#x2013; is also royalty: the third son of Emperor Gradio Theseon. He had not gotten along with you at first, but saving each other&apos;s lives had soon put that feeling to rest.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Celebrations are a fine thing, Master Theseon.&#x201D; Althus, the prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; of High Priest Ardunnos and renowned warrior of faith, clasps his hands together as if in prayer. &#x201C;It would be a good opportunity to give thanks to the goddesses for our success.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t y&#x2019;all talking a bit too quick about success?&#x201D; drawls the mysterious rogue, Syke Nimfeet. He has never spoken about his origins, but his mastery of stealth and poisons has bailed your group out of many tricky situations over the past year. &#x201C;Of course, retirement&#x2019;s good and all, but we gotta live first. Retiring to the grave ain&#x2019;t in my plans.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Kyle laughs. &#x201C;Do not be so pessimistic, Syke! We will be victorious on the morrow, I am sure of it!&#x201D; He glances at you askew and adds, &#x201C;After all, we have the Hero, Fate&#x2019;s Chosen, with us in battle!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed,&#x201D; nods Althus. &#x201C;Atropos herself has decreed that our threads are to last beyond the battle with the Demon Lord, for it is <i>his </i>thread that shall be cut in our confrontation. Put more faith in your creators, Nimfeet.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Alright, alright. I know not to get into another of these debates with ya, Althus,&#x201D; chuckles Syke. &#x201C;Right, Lobelia, m&#x2019;dear?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The wizard scowls at him when he mentions her name. &#x201C;Do not drag me into this.&#x201D; But even the full, icy glare of one of the Nine Archmagi of the Tower, the most powerful magic organization in the world, is insufficient to smother Syke Nimfeet&#x2019;s wide, cocky grin.<br>
<br>
You see Rurik Magnussen shaking his head gently, his beard covering a faint smile. He catches your gaze and winks, demonstrating sharp instincts undulled by age. The master bowman is the oldest one here, and has constantly been a source of stability when all hope seemed lost. That he has not said anything so far means that he knows they are engaging in nothing more than banter.<br>
<br>
All of them had their reasons for coming this far. So did those that had fallen along the way. Layla. Rennock. Talley. You still remember their deaths clearly, and the vows that everyone made: that those who remained would fulfill the wishes of those who had departed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t seem to be particularly chatty tonight. Worrying about the dead again?&#x201D; A tap on your shoulder gets your attention. It is Mieren Zaos, the wandering martial artist from the north who could match knights with her bare hands and feet. The wild, freezing lands there were beyond the rule of the Seven Kingdoms, inhabited by fierce, independent tribes. You had to wonder &#x2013; just <i>how </i>did the emissaries pick a girl like this as a hero candidate? Watching your expression keenly, Mieren snaps, &#x201C;Hey, you were thinking something rude about me, weren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; She tosses her head in that distinctive, familiar way, her auburn hair glinting in the firelight.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, not at all,&#x201D; you reply lightly. &#x201C;I was just trying to remember what <i>I </i>was thinking when I joined up.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As far as you could remember, at the time, your thoughts were of&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Justice. The suffering of the people must come to an end. You will lead humanity&#x2019;s fight against evil in order to bring justice to the Demon Lord and his fiendish army. His reign of terror must come to an end, and you will be the one to do it.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Glory. Honour and glory. It would be a good way to prove yourself and increase your standing in the world. A hero would go very, very far in the power structure of the Seven Kingdoms. A messianic hero, even more so.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Materialistic needs. Money, women, and more money, not necessarily in that order, and more women wouldn&#x2019;t hurt, either. Surely they will reward a hero handsomely. You are sure that you will be swimming in more than one type of booty if you survive.<br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>Reluctance. If it were left up to you, you couldn&#x2019;t even be arsed to lift your arse up and save the world. Let the world save itself for once, you have better things to do! But unfortunately, the amount of spears aimed at your neck has given you no choice.

            <h3>Demon Lord&#039;s Castle</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Demon Lord&#x2019;s Castle</span></b><br>
<br>
As you recall your initial reluctance, the offer that you could not refuse, and the elaborate scheme of madness you pretended to avoid being involved in this war, you yawn. Mieren jabs at your cheek playfully with the finger that you had once seen her use to pierce an orc&#x2019;s skull. The head had exploded seconds later, almost showering you in bits of orcish brain if not for the magic shield that you had put up just in time. &#x201C;Really, are you feeling sleepy already?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I like to reserve my strength for more important battles.&#x201D; You&#x2019;re close. You can feel it. Success is at hand! You pat the ground besides you and say, &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh, no.&#x201D; With a cheeky grin, the red-haired martial artist spins away, her taut posterior wiggling slightly as if to taunt you. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m reserving my strength for a more important battle.&#x201D; Damn. Ah well, baby steps, you suppose. You are just making an investment for the future.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Shot down again,&#x201D; chuckles Syke.<br>
<br>
You shrug. &#x201C;It was worth a try&#x2026; I think I&#x2019;ll try again tomorrow, Mieren?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She sticks out her tongue at you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Tomorrow we face the Demon Lord.&#x201D; Rurik chides you with a gentle smile. &#x201C;I scarcely think that even you could find time to flirt during such a momentous battle.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You would be surprised.&#x201D; Lobelia speaks up, impassive. &#x201C;Remember the thousand orcs battle at Redtaur Valley? He found time then.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Mieren raises an eyebrow. &#x201C;Was <i>that</i> what you were doing when we were split up?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I fancied myself a skirt-chaser, but you surely triumph over me in so many ways.&#x201D; Kyle slaps his thigh, shaking his head in laughter. &#x201C;How <i>were</i> you picked as the Hero over the rest of us? A lazy scholar who did not even know how to hold a sword when we first met?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know myself.&#x201D; As you speak your doubts, the Hero&#x2019;s Medal pinned to your chest tingles gently, subtly reminding you of your destiny and of the righteousness of your cause. &#x201C;Perhaps the goddesses love me?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The goddesses love all mankind equally, but they would not reciprocate the love of a womanizer. Not in that profane way, so stop your drooling,&#x201D; lectures Althus mockingly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hey, I resent that. I&#x2019;m not <i>a</i> womanizer,&#x201D; you grin. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m the best damn womanizer in the world.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh? You mean like that time at Kolyptus, where you&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As the band laughs, recalling some of the escapades that they have been through, you lean back, feeling utterly relaxed. It is a feeling that you have only had in two places in your life: your parents&#x2019; ancestral home in the Windspear Heights, and your cozy corner in the Academy of Towers. Perhaps it is strange to feel this way, the night before the battle&#x2026; but it feels right.<br>
<br>
With them, you feel at home.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Dawn breaks, and the ground shudders with the reverberation of a thousand horns blaring in the distance. You open your eyes blearily, nudge awake by a combination of the noise and of Mieren shaking your shoulders.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s time!&#x201D; she hisses excitedly.<br>
<br>
The Seven Kingdoms are marching on the Demon Lord&#x2019;s stronghold. The armies of humanity and demonkind would clash before the black spire, in an apocalyptic battle that would decide the fate of this world&#x2026; but in truth, it was a diversion, planned as cover for your heroic assault on the castle.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are we ready?&#x201D; asks Lobelia, her staff held high.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wait, wait, wait,&#x201D; interrupts Syke. &#x201C;Are you certain this will work?&#x201D; he asks you nervously.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It should,&#x201D; you scratch your chin.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;His plan is sound,&#x201D; agrees Lobelia. &#x201C;If I am the one casting the magic, it will work.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Who would have thought that jumping short distances would not be disrupted by the demons&#x2019; anti-teleportation field?&#x201D; Althus murmurs. &#x201C;Why is that?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They spread it wide in order to prevent any direct incursions from the Seven Kingdoms. Think of it like casting a net over the Black Spire and the surrounding lands&#x2026; hey, I&#x2019;m not here to give a lecture on magic,&#x201D; you sigh. &#x201C;All you need to know is that it will work. If you are <i>that </i>interested in the theory, go hit up the library once we finish the job.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You only suggested this plan because you were tired of walking, weren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; Kyle smirks knowingly.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true,&#x201D; you admit. It <i>is</i> riskier than walking, but it is also so much quicker once you make the effort to get the magic right. &#x201C;But if it works&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then it works,&#x201D; says Rurik. &#x201C;Results are all that matter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I just hope we don&#x2019;t get our body parts mixed up or something&#x2026;&#x201D; mutters the still reluctant Syke. &#x201C;Magic travel&#x2026; oh man.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Please, I am not <i>such </i>an amateur that I would let that happen,&#x201D; retorts Lobelia, brimming with icy pride.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;C&#x2019;mon, we&#x2019;re wasting time here. Let&#x2019;s get this over with!&#x201D; Mieren pounds her fists together impatiently. Her fiery red eyes glint with barely restrained bloodlust. She gives you a wink and a grin: you take it as a promise of fun things to come once this is &#x2018;over with&#x2019;.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That is correct. It is time for the Hero and his brave companions to fulfill their Fate-woven destiny&#x2026;&#x201D; says Althus.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We are ready.&#x201D; Rurik nods confidently. &#x201C;Give the order, Hero.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very well. It&#x2019;s been a long journey, my friends, but soon that journey will reach its conclusion.&#x201D; Looking each of them in the eye, you continue, &#x201C;For Layla, Rennock, and Talley&#x2026;&#x201D; They bow their heads, their eyes closed as they murmur the names of your dead comrades. &#x201C;We will put an end to the Demon Lord today, save the world, and return victorious! Then I can finally use my well-deserved fame to declare a Month of Laziness throughout the entire land, so all of you&#x2026; don&#x2019;t die before you can enjoy it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;But before that, one last bout of effort,&#x201D; says Kyle solemnly. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t slack off now, dear leader.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You laugh. &#x201C;Lobelia, take us in.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The demon knight stands in your way, its gigantic two-handed axe poised to strike. The ragged red cloak swishes gently behind it, striking a sharp contrast with the spiky, black armor. With the knight clad from head to toe in full plate, you are unable to see your opponent&#x2019;s expression. Behind it is a set of massive double doors, and beyond, you can sense an overpowering presence awaiting you. The Demon Lord.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;So, you are the last obstacle?&#x201D; You are alone, in the depths of the Black Spire. The others had been bogged down by the endless hordes of desperate demons attempting to defend their king, and you had been separated from them. No matter: you had dispatched whatever monsters you found on your way easily enough. A trail of corpses lies behind you. The blessing of the Goddesses was stronger than ever, here in the heart of evil. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t suppose you would let me walk past without a fight?&#x201D; you ask. &#x201C;It would be so much easier for all of us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The black knight responds by swinging its over-sized axe at you. You leap back. It impacts the stone floor with the force of an explosion, hurling rubble everywhere. As you dust off your armor, you draw the Hero&#x2019;s Sword. Muttering a thanks to Rennock for training you in the handling of weapons, you take up a basic stance. The knight attacks again, and you parry. The force of your swing pushes the demon back, and even behind its faceless helm you get the feeling that it is surprised at your strength. You might not have the best technique amongst swordsmen, but as you are now, you could still best almost any human knight in the world.<br>
<br>
You exchange a few more ground-shattering blows with your foe: it is more skilled, but you are stronger and faster. Though you might win at this rate, who knows how long it would take? You would like to finish off your opponent quickly without dragging things out - after all, its king awaits you beyond those doors, and it would be impolite to keep him waiting <i>too </i>long. Given the demon knight&apos;s high durability&#x2026;<br>
<br>
You take a step back and sheathe your sword.<br>
<br>
The surprised demon speaks for the first time. &#x201C;What is the matter, Hero? Have you given up?&#x201D; it taunts, its voice distorted badly by the monstrous helm. It still seems confident that it can defeat you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, I just thought it was rather silly of me to engage you in a physical battle when my specialty is in magic,&#x201D; you say casually. Yes, one of your own creations would do the trick. You would need nothing less than that to put the demon knight down in one hit.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your&#x2026; what?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You grin, and begin to cast your signature spell&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>Gigadyne. The original spell that earned you the nickname of the &#x2018;Thunder Emperor&#x2019;, and the most powerful lightning magic in existence. It transmutes matter into pure electrical energy, and can be cast directly as an attack magic, used to empower your equipment, or to transform you into an intangible lightning form that is impervious to most weapons and spells. Initially conceived as a way to both bypass anti-teleportation defenses and damage security measures in the Academy&#x2019;s female bathhouses.<br>
<br>
<i>Rank increase: Agility (in lightning form)</i><br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>Soulscythe. The original spell that earned you the nickname of the &#x2018;Saint of Death&#x2019;, and the most feared death magic in the Seven Kingdoms. It summons an enormous, ethereal scythe that can reap an entire battlefield of enemies in the blink of an eye. The use of death magic in the summon grants the scythe the chance to sever a target&#x2019;s thread of life with a lucky hit, turning them into your skeletal minions. Initially conceived as a way to clear lawns quickly in a brief attempt at starting a lawn-clearing business.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>Black Dispel. The original spell that earned you the nickname of the &#x2018;God Crusher&#x2019;, and the strongest application of gravitational magic at present. It generates a powerful force field that multiplies the weight of everything besides the caster a thousand-fold and draws them into the center of the spell. Those who are able to survive the crushing force will find their physical capabilities impaired while within the field. Initially conceived as a way to compact garbage infinitely without having to clean up.<br>
<br>
<i>Major decrease: Physical Attack, Physical Defense, Agility (on opponents)</i><br>
<br>
<b>D. </b>Reality Tear. The original spell that earned you the title of the &#x201C;Killer of Dimensions&#x201D;, and the finest offensive magic known to humanity. Following the caster&#x2019;s fingers, it rips a tear in the fabric of reality, effectively acting as a slashing attack that bypasses physical and magical resistance. Only dimensional magic can defend against it, and once struck, its damage can only be healed by the reversal of time. Initially conceived as a method of spying on examination papers through opening a dimensional rift.

            <h3>The Final Battle</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Final Battle</span></b><br>
<br>
The massive, ornate doors to the Demon Lord&#x2019;s throne room buckle, crack, and then explode inwards in a golden torrent of energy. As splinters of stone and metal rain down across the polished black marble, you walk through the deformed opening left behind by your spell. The demon knight is on its back, the thick armor sizzling and broken. It stirs, struggling to get up. Its gauntleted fingers fumble weakly for the melted remains of the battle axe by its side.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re a tough one, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; you whistle. &#x201C;Tell you what, if you stay down and take a nap, I&#x2019;ll pretend I didn&#x2019;t see you slacking off.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I will not let you get your way,&#x201D; gasps the demon.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Have it your way.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING TO MY DAUGHTER, HERO?&#x201D; The loud, commanding voice stops you before you can deliver the final blow. That&#x2019;s right, the Demon Lord. You had almost forgotten about him. You look towards the end of the great hall, where he is seated on his throne. Almost as if he was patiently awaiting your arrival. As tall and as powerfully built as an ogre, with six great horns sprouting from his head, black, bat-like wings that could span the hall&#x2019;s width, a full beard that would put any emperor to envy, and a fiery glare malicious enough to wither spines at a single glance, he looks every bit the grotesque Demon Lord you had expected to see from the tales told of his evil exploits.<br>
<br>
But more importantly&#x2026; &#x201C;Gigadyne.&#x201D; Daughter, he said? With a flick of your fingers, you turn the demon knight&#x2019;s battered armor into lightning. The knight yelps out in a panic. It is enveloped in a dazzling light which arcs away, shattering stone where it lands. As the crackling electricity subsides, you are able to see the demon&#x2019;s actual form. You look down at the voluptuous silver-haired girl in front of you, helplessly trying to cover her nakedness. You look back at the Demon Lord. You shake your head.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, I really don&#x2019;t see the family resemblance,&#x201D; you murmur apologetically.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;REST ASSURED THAT SHE IS THE FRUIT OF MY LOINS.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Does she take more after her mother, then?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;THAT IS SO, HERO.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A stroke of good luck, Demon Lord.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t talk about me like I&#x2019;m not here!&#x201D; The enraged demon princess, as stunning as her father is hideous even in her anger, musters up enough of her remaining strength to fly at you, her claws raking the air. She is stopped quite ignominiously enough by a dark, translucent wall. It transforms into a cube and encloses her, floating away into the air. She shouts at you, kicking and punching the cube, but her words do not make it past the barrier. Though you seem to recognize some rather rude words from the movement of her lips.<br>
<br>
The chill of fear runs down your spine for quite the first time in a while. Dark Wall, an extremely powerful defensive magic. It twists space to form a nigh impenetrable barrier, yet the Demon Lord had seemed to cast it on a whim without even reciting the incantation. Of course, you have ways of getting past magic of this nature, but all of those methods would take effort.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;NOW THAT OUR LITTLE DISTRACTION IS OUT OF THE WAY,&#x201D; booms the Demon Lord, &#x201C;ARE YOU PREPARED TO STEP ONTO THE STAGE OF YOUR DESTINY, HERO? NO&#x2026; PERHAPS ASSASSIN WOULD BE MORE BEFITTING A TITLE.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It would be,&#x201D; you agree. You had long acknowledged the real nature of your quest. In war, sending an agent to bypass armies and decapitate the enemy&#x2019;s leadership is an act of assassination. Though some of the others &#x2013; Kyle and Althus, in particular &#x2013; would have balked at being portrayed that way, you are under no illusions about your actions. The Hero&#x2019;s Medal throbs warmly as it always does when you have the slightest doubt in your heart, reassuring you of your righteousness once again, and you say, &#x201C;But as long as it is for a just cause, it does not matter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;AN ASSASSIN IS EXPENDABLE. THEY ARE PUPPETS TO BE DISCARDED AFTER THEIR PURPOSE IS ACHIEVED&#x2026; PUPPETS OF FATE THAT DO NOT QUESTION WHETHER THEIR CAUSE IS JUST.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have seen your dungeons on my way here, Demon Lord. You do not have a right to moralize about causes. Are you going to deny that you have harmed innocents next?&#x201D; They were a gallery of horrors that had caused even stoic Rurik to turn away. Captured villagers peeled open like frogs, their innards laid bare while still kept alive by healing magic. Rows and rows of live brains in jars. Strange experiments that mated man and beast in various ways, creating misshapen monstrosities that could not survive on their own.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;INNOCENT THEY MAY BE, BUT IN THE END HUMANS ARE JUST LIVESTOCK. THEY SERVE A BETTER PURPOSE IN ADVANCING MY KNOWLEDGE,&#x201D; replies the Demon Lord imperiously. &#x201C;FURTHERMORE, DO YOUR OWN KINGS NOT CONDONE THE SAME TO MY PEOPLE?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You had heard of captured prisoners being experimented on, but those rumours had begun after you left the capital.  You could probably start to argue about who started it first, and how experimenting on prisoners of war could be more morally justified than doing so to innocent civilians, but it would be too much of a bother to engage in such a long debate. After all, you are here for one reason only: to slay the Demon Lord. And if he is talking this much instead of immediately ambushing you with his strongest spells, he must have something in mind.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t say that you are being very convincing, Demon Lord,&#x201D; you say, drawing your sword. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll have to offer me something better. The sooner we get this over with, the sooner I can go back to lazing about.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I SEE. MORAL REASON WILL NOT WORK. VERY WELL, LET US MOVE NEGOTIATIONS UP A NOTCH. I BELIEVE THE CUSTOMARY OFFER IN THIS SCENARIO WOULD BE&#x2026; HALF OF THE WORLD, WAS IT NOT?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a bit more tempting, I must admit.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;AHEM.&#x201D; The massive demon coughs politely, and stands up from his throne. His wings stretch out, blotting out the light from the torches. The gust created from such a minor movement almost forces you to your knees to stay upright. Placing the full weight of his attention upon you, he declares: &#x201C;JOIN ME, HERO, AND YOU WILL HAVE HALF OF THE WORLD IN YOUR HANDS.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
You respond:<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>&#x201C;We have a deal.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s half of the world! How could any sane person turn down an offer like that? It would be a great start for your ambitions, a perfect package to kick off the rest of your life. When you are the ruler of half the world, you can easily laze your days away without any consequence, with more luxury and women than you know what to do with.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>&#x201C;I would rather have your daughter instead.&#x201D; Ruling the world, even in name only, sounds like a hassle. Being the son-in-law of the Demon Lord that rules the world seems like an easier life. After all, you do not discriminate. A beautiful woman is a beautiful woman, no matter the species, and the demon princess is quite possibly the loveliest girl you have ever seen.<br>
<br>
<b>C. </b>&#x201C;I refuse!&#x201D; It is an insult to think that you would bow to the fiend that you have been fighting so long against. Humans are livestock to him: the Demon Lord cannot be trusted. The Hero&#x2019;s Medal shines brightly, giving you confidence to fight. What sort of betrayer would you be to turn against your allies when the enemy is pushed to the brink? Besides, if you <i>actually</i> wanted the trouble of ruling half the world, you&#x2019;d plan for that yourself.

            <h3>An Offering to the King of Demons</h3>
            </a>
            
					



					<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">An Offering to the King of Demons</span></b><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would rather have your daughter instead,&#x201D; you say, half in jest. Surely he would not agree. But if he did, you would consider the offer <i>rather </i>seriously. It would be as good as marrying into royalty. Sure, there was that little issue of possibly becoming the greatest traitor the human race has ever known, and betraying all that your comrades have died for, but would it not be easier to change the world by showing them that: yes, demons and humans <i>can </i>coexist?<br>
<br>
That would be a nicely noble excuse to give everyone later on, you think to yourself in satisfaction. The perfect excuse for you to get your hands on those perfect spheres of magnificent wobbling.<br>
<br>
The cube containing the Demon Lord&#x2019;s daughter shudders as she unleashes a dazzling flurry of powerful punches and kicks on the dark walls, silently screaming what you can only assume to be demonic profanities. You begin to wonder if she might not actually do the impossible and break free. She has clearly picked up on your words &#x2013; and perhaps your lecherous intent &#x2013; and she does not like it. Not one bit.<br>
<br>
The Demon Lord is silent, his massive bulk towering above you. When he speaks, it is in a slightly softer tone of voice than before.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;MY DAUGHTER, YOU SAY?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; you wink. &#x201C;Your lovely daughter.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;HM. A MERE HUMAN DARES TO ASK FOR MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A hero,&#x201D; you correct him. &#x201C;I am not without my strengths.&#x201D; You would have wagered some money on him being angered by the very idea, but to your surprise, the Demon Lord actually appears to be intrigued. You are entirely unsure how this will play out now.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I AM <i>SURPRISED</i> THAT THE THOUGHT EVEN MANAGED TO CROSS YOUR FEEBLE LITTLE MIND, HERO. IT BEARS CONSIDERATION FOR THAT ALONE,&#x201D; he muses. &#x201C;BUT I AM AFRAID I MUST ASK FOR PROOF OF YOUR DETERMINATION.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
That&#x2019;s right. He was never going to agree so easily. You saw it coming a mile away. &#x201C;So it comes down to this, does it? I will not attack my comrades-&#x201C;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;NO, I DO NOT REQUIRE YOU TO MASSACRE YOUR FORMER ALLIES. I ONLY ASK FOR A MATERIAL OFFERING TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR FEALTY. SOMETHING LIKE&#x2026; YES, THAT EMBLEM OF THE GODDESSES YOU WEAR PROUDLY UPON YOUR CHEST.&#x201D; A massive finger is raised towards you, pointing at the Hero&#x2019;s Medal. &#x201C;I WILL ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTIONS.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This thing? It&#x2019;s just a cheap piece of silver,&#x201D; you say quickly. Why would he want the medal?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM OFFERING IT TO ME.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Demon Lord is very insistent. Hesitantly, you place one hand over the Hero&apos;s Medal. There is something strange about it at the moment. The surface is warm, and it appears to be vibrating in a gentle yet somehow slightly menacing manner. When you close your hand around the medal and pull, the vibration begins to intensify. It feels like a warning to you: a warning not to betray your heart of justice, a reminder from the Goddesses to stay on the path of light. Are you doing the wrong thing? Is this an ill-advised rejection of your destiny? The act of merely thinking about giving the medal to the Demon Lord is causing you to sweat where a hundred-strong demon army had failed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CANNOT DO IT AFTER ALL?&#x201D; The Demon Lord is not surprised: this does not seem to be an unexpected outcome for him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; Your fingers tighten around the Hero&#x2019;s Medal&#x2026;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<b>A. </b>You rip the Hero&#x2019;s Medal off and throw it at the Demon Lord.<br>
<br>
<b>B. </b>You leave the Hero&#x2019;s Medal where it is.
